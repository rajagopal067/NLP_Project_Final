sons * there is no usb cable.* quality of headset is average.
[-1] star for slow charging os its default charger.
performance is also very good well design and accurate delivery by lip part headphone sound was average.hd recording is good and camera is effective on dark room no light at 3.5 peter only and picture is good on mobile flash light.headphone wired is not too good.file manager not found on 4.4.4.
sim ports are not working os catch the signal properly.
it feels like using a tablet to call and i have to use a hands free set as an option even when they dont came in the box another minus is the absence of usb cable for charging because i work all day on a computer and we have few plugs in the officer.
fire of the charger is long enough and the quality of camera and headphones are also best eye bye samsung and foka.
it had all the mentioned accessories like charge headset, warranty cards manual.
the only thing missing is the data cable which we need to purchase separately.
the accessory headphone will stop working if not handled with care.
bones os there were no bones in the device whatsoever but the charger shipped with this phone heat up like a often rocky.
coming to the phone,it has many issues.the battery is very weak,the ear piece produces a cracking sound during calls,the mobile and the charger heat a lot,the mobile takes nearly 4 his to charge,the volume and power buttons are very loose,the ear phone provided is a piece of crap,the touch is not responsive,we can feel the issue with touch screen when we are tying a message(you can test the touch screen issue by keeping your mobile on a flat surface and then type some letters or numbers and try meeting them one by newby continuously pressing the delete key.
i ordered a motor which got damaged in charger port.second time i replaced cell were i faced the same problem.so buyers do not buy moto go and do not shop any products from flipkart.
4)during charging of this mobile the charger and mobile both are overheating.
charger is too slow takes approve 2.5 to 3 he to charge from 15% to 100%.
i had to use headphone to complete my 30 mind office call 2.
battery takes almost 3 hours to get fully charged unfortunately i wont have that patience os to you can assume for such a long charing duration what could be the temperature of charger & phone.
pathetic least reduce the size of charger & make it usb cum charger for better effectiveness screen guard missing in the box now a days mobile worth k & above provides 2 screen guard & usb kit along.pathetic least reduce the size of charger & make it usb cum charger for better effectiveness screen guard missing in the box now a days mobile worth k & above provides 2 screen guard & usb kit along.
only one drawback battery charger given by motorola is not good does not fix to socket properly i tried all types of sockets but it dose not fix properly.
3 hours for charging and cheap quality head phones,charger,battery drying very fast every 10 mint 1 percent battery increasing in standby.we should use tireless headset.
charger is worst.it takes nearly 5-6 hours for charging the phone(4/10) cheap gorilla glass.
would have had a better headphone with the device as the default one doesn have much effect.charging using the default charger is something that i wish i wouldn have to do as it takes unto his to charge from os to 100%.
i even tried another charger but nothing am so disappointed.
sound (speaker)- excellent sound(headphone)- average camera (primary)- very good camera(front)- excellent internet & apps- very good display and view- excellent video - excellent documents -very good battery - very good touch- good sensor - very excellent overall the motorola device is a complete smartphone surprisingly in just 12999/-.
charger is red hot within 5 minutes of charging and is not charging even with usual pace.
i suggest motorola should also provide a usb charger instead of direct attached cable so we can charge it from laptop.i suggest motorola should also provide a usb charger instead of direct attached cable so we can charge it from laptop.
the charger is getting so heated when mobile is charged through that.my.friends charger is not working right now.make sure to buy a quality products.
the charger is a single piece which i didn like unlike the us to micro us connection types.
but decided on this moto g was i loved the lollipop interface on a friends phone & also there are certain apes that i needed to use,which were not available in the windows store.after spending the 2 days with the moto g os am loving it.on the downside,the box pack doesn include a data cable & the hands actually comes with kitkat not lollipop,out of the box.
another thing which i didn like is that moto g hasn come with a usb cable.the phone isn getting overheard and not is the charger for now.
lot of time to charge the battery may be because of charger issues.
even if you manage to somehow adjust it to work just touch the pin or even the cable and bam!!!.
absence of us cable is such a dissapointment.
wont forget to take your charger with you might even want to get a second one.i did appreciate the battery charger being included in the box and not just a usb connector.
charging using the moto g charger takes a long 3 his to charge.however replacing it with a fast charger reduces this time to 1.5 - 2 his.
no separate usb cable.
the other which i could highlight is it dint come with a data cable but that something i think we can live with.
i got moto g and men 3 days back (27th oct 2014 evening i like to inform you that i got a faulty headphone.one side of the headphone is not working at all.
please let me know how to copy stuff from my c to shone i attached data cable and tried to copy songs to phone but it can.
to usb cable.
i got the all accessories except hands with battery.is data cable would come with moto g(2nd men mobile.
i have played games and listened to music via my bluetooth headset and also downloading 1 os of moves all at the same time without any last.
charger is not in working condition but fpk(flipkart) gave me refund for that charge.
by moto g and men set is a black colour but i received white colour of charger & head phone i am surprised & didn expect these type of service from flipkart.
mobile was good and but charger is wasted in a month and also charge capacity is very less compared to other moblies.

met this phone two days before west phone in this price range here are some problems and solutions os slow charging - it takes 3.15 hours on my first charge when 10% battery remaining then second time with same 10% remaining battery i charged with my samsung 1.0mah charger this time it gets full charged in 2.10 hours.to get good charger.
package arrived earlier than estimated and the product was in perfect conditions.pros:- definitely the best phone under $200 or even $300- very smooth experience camera works surprisingly well sterno speakers on the front produces great sound it the end of a normal day (wi-fi on running light apes and browser), battery is still above 50%- inch os screen is awesome- design is cool and simple while not looking cheap not slippery and very comfortable to hold unless you have small hands while the screen is big bells are think customer support is relatively great motorola migrate assist and alert apes can be very useful micro os support master android updated including android l)cons:- something to be noticed only in medium-term, 1gb of ram may not satisfy all users some expected noise on pictures taken in low-light- nfc and os would be welcomeobservations:- us/global gsm versions are not dual-chip- does not come with usb cable.
well i am using the phone for almost a month now and what i should say about this phone well first of all it had plenty of room for improvement one is the charger has a fixed cable another is sorting in the settings pp is missing,the screen is a little hard to read in direct sunlight but clarity and viewing angles are otherwise good.well i am using the phone for almost a month now and what i should say about this phone well first of all it had plenty of room for improvement one is the charger has a fixed cable another is sorting in the settings pp is missing,the screen is a little hard to read in direct sunlight but clarity and viewing angles are otherwise good.
charger is not working and there was some issue in mobile.but they didn replaces the charger yet almost one month is over.
os a result it does not come with conductivity cable.i guess that selling this excellent phone at this low price does not allow to ship it with any headset.
headset doesn work.charger overhearing.
display screen is good charger is very long time charging my phone.
also i have read reviews of many people complaining about the charger that heat up while charging.
supplied accessories are rubbish but they should have made the charger detachable it is fixed means no usb cable supplied you have to buy or use old spare ones.supplied accessories are rubbish but they should have made the charger detachable it is fixed means no usb cable supplied you have to buy or use old spare ones.

i am not sure whether this issue is because of the stock charger or with the battery but i am strongly request flipkart to do something in this regard as the features of this outstanding phone should not fade away in lime light because of the battery back up.
the second negative is the time it takes to charge this phone with the charger they have given.

but headset is malfunctioning with in 4 months.
charger supplied is very poor quality , only 550ma.
the only thing i hate about this phone is that motorola does not provide usb cable along with this phone.
moto g had a small (6-8") data cable but and men has none guess its cost cutting measure 4.
and also there is no data cable is given.
case vlc layer from store which is free sons to usb cable provided reduced 1/2 star for this earphones are not at all great(reduced 1/2 star for this - i used this after using samsung os and the beats and pass is no way comparable.
right side of the headphone not working properly.i think that the headphone is a damaged piece.

his phone is outstanding in peroformance.it does not lag at all.processor speed is mindblowing.camera is outstanding have no words to describes its sharpness at this price point.front facing cam is very good for selfie.runs every pp smoother as it says.the now factor of this phone is its speakers one word only holly shit.the only drawback is its headphone its of cheap quality it should have being least decent quality.thats it so my review is go for it if u are looking for low budget smartphone having higher specs.
battery was showing 10% remaining and after connecting to os charger it came up to 100% in 30 mind.
one biggest con is that there is no usb cable provided with the products.
(u can get a otg from any phone shop at 50-60 bucks battery and connectivity the new moto g is furnished with the regular conductivity features like 3g, dual sim shots wi-fi, bluetooth, gps and usb ports.charger is poor takes too much to charge phone.
but headset is same for all moto devices that is draw back for this one.
battery is ok.but it needs improvement (backup wise usb cable should be provided.other wise we have to depend on other sources again which is not good for your products.
why the data cable has not supplied, i could not understood.
all have to carry the charger along with me all the time.

the charger gets heated very soon even when used for just 10 to 15 minutes.
have been using for over 3 months till now no issues like hanging or heating as such other than battery running out soon when using os network but that just andros & moto's way of telling you keep your charger close by phone comes loaded with most of the features which are generally abundant in all other bands so not much to tell camera is decent so is the dual sterno speakers they are loud but who plays music on mobile phone speakers other than plug the headphones.the packing comes very simple & there no data cable which is a big negative point if you dont have any lying around i already had 2-3 so no worries there the headphones provided inside are very basic variety you would do better to buy a good one separately i use effusion twinwoofers with poweramp so music listening is awesome.
after 1 month of use the phone is not charging with the charger which came along with the phone but charges with other similar charges but charging is really very slow.
by biggest disappointments are the following - phone gets heated up while on call - the fitting of the charger into the oh port is extremely tight(everytime you try plugging the battery you fear if you'll screw up the ports - battery is of poor quality takes long to charge - camera is obviously better on this one by motorola standards but still not much compared to other bands.by biggest disappointments are the following - phone gets heated up while on call - the fitting of the charger into the oh port is extremely tight(everytime you try plugging the battery you fear if you'll screw up the ports - battery is of poor quality takes long to charge - camera is obviously better on this one by motorola standards but still not much compared to other bands.

the ports are placed in perfect positions and it does really give a great look when held > next the camera i still wonder if the front one is really mix os it feels like a mix cam os the shots in the front and back are solid but it clearly misses some details in natural daylight os that is one big con with the phone but considering the prices i would say it is the best.but if you are not a heavy user you need not worry must go for it > the supplied headset could have been better and data cable is missing price has no effect on the accessories supplied.but if you are not a heavy user you need not worry must go for it > the supplied headset could have been better and data cable is missing price has no effect on the accessories supplied.

i was satisfied with the mobile phone but days passes headset quality was poor.i was not satisfied with the performance of the headset.
charger provided is below standard its heating up itself and the phone while charging so i stopped using that.
i can only imagine that its because of the lollipop updated but the phone frequently acts as if its unable to adequately run the os.it's also started notifying me that the battery has completely discharged even after its been on the charger all day.
i have a car charger so i usually do that and that works out for me.

battery discharges faster on g but everyone knows that **cons - the only thing that i would like to point out is that the charger provided with it tends to heat the device a little while charging.
but the charger provided with phone is not good.
mobile screen is bad speakers are not working properly , charger is defective piece.
summarizing i would definitely recommend this phone although i would add that it takes ages for the phone to charge with the moto provided charger and that the earphones seem too cheap but perform as expected from motor.
headphone could have been better.

use of samsung micro us charger is advisable.headphone sounds not so premium but considering the phone budget it is acceptable.
the sound is crisp and loud from both the speakers and when used the headset really good and entertaining which will keep you busy listening to music for hours.os the headset model provided with the phone are really obsolete ones.

if u say that it is attached to the charger wire.it is stuck my friend.
however the wall charger does not look original and it is not working.
voice quality in recording is hard to believe the earphones provided could have been better and the usb transfer cable which was missing would have made the deal even better but nonetheless overall i am highly satisfied with the product so far.
no data cable provided along with the box 2.charger gets headed in just 10 minute.headset is of poor quality.
does not comes with headphone or screenguard or cover so you have to get those separately.
i may get a charger for os 400 from any local manufacturer from the flipkart web itself but i feel created because i prefer to have a charger from the same moto os which generally cost more than 1000.i may get a charger for os 400 from any local manufacturer from the flipkart web itself but i feel created because i prefer to have a charger from the same moto os which generally cost more than 1000.

door headphone quality should not expect much for this price point hats all in my review.
cons:- battery back is the main issue p.s- get or self a portable charger if or a aid music listeners game etc battery back is only for 7-8 his wid heavy usage os little heating on the back while running too many applications.
one suggestion i could give is motorola should improve quality of earphone and charger that ships with devices.
however the phone speakers are loud enough to listen to music in the car with reasonable clarity i can listen to music by plugging in a headset, so the 3.5mm input itself works fine.
charger was not same brand as phone but that doesn bother me at all.
- to data cable within the package.
no usb cable 2.
while talking in phone you can not connect to bluetooth headset.data cable is not given.
