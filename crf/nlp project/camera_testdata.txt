i have been using since last week and i enjoyed it first 2-3 days but after that i felt many problems with camera touchscreen etc when i request to return they humbly accepted it.come to the point please do not buy after 2-3 days uses you can find os camera many times hanged and automatically it exit from application os touch screen is not working some for very short time os battery life is average but it takes very long time to charge os wi-fi connection automatically disconnected os during call you may feel stitches in voice os you may feel heating at backside during more than 10 min call os lots of other functions are also not working as per specification.
the camera is also not very good.
the camera is okay.i didn expect the front camera to be good but it actually turned out to be really good.however although its true for almost any phone camera in foka gumma work better even when they are of less resolution.but dont let a not-so-good camera stop you from buying this.

battery back proper not os very fast down but other features very good i like it camera.
best honest amazing featueres,camera is good,battery is also good sturdy reliable product.
but video playback is not unto the mark.video playback interrupt sometimes.

excellent camera events o movement.
excellent features and excellent camera in this prices.
its been a month now i am using this phone everyone knows how the hands is but i would like point out a few things pro camera quality and flash quality both the rear and front came are great touch is flexible the new lollipop interface and design is catch and cool 12gb unable memory cons:batery life is 9-10 hours(2g)/7-8hours(3g) on internet usage if the the phone hangs somehow you will have to start from root does not show modifications when org or us connected no quick twitching to silent mode like previous versions.
all directly come to pro and sons of this very good phone gros - * value for money * not much of heating issue unlike most of the andros phone * smooth interface * upgradeable to lollypop * almost native andros * dual him and good speakers * decent camera * feels sturdy sons - * pathetic display.of novo can upgrade the display it will be awesome camera.

been using this phone for 3 months now its a great phone especially at this prices positives: speed is great camera is good too better than the likes of os etc - pictures are clear colours are good dropped it a lot of times(accidently obs :p), body is strong dint break or get damaged in any way negatives: battery - will last not more than a day with average usage and takes a lot of time to get charged (approx 2-3 hours to get fully charged want set songs as ringtones!!.
camera isn great but its what to expect for a cheaper phone.
wen u switch to imp mode it will give dslr type output which is awesome.front cam is awesome and series will be just crisp if u use apes ly retract or b612.

i may have just gotten a bad phone but with 1200 may battery meant for its predecessor which is significantly smaller battery life is as expected.the camera is great for taking pictures of textbook pages and wherever there is a lot of light.his is a standard camera but not completely horrible.the screen ardor the camera is very dull.
his phone is outstanding in peroformance.it does not lag at all.processor speed is mindblowing.camera is outstanding have no words to describes its sharpness at this price point.front facing cam is very good for selfie.runs every pp smoother as it says.the now factor of this phone is its speakers one word only holly shit.the only drawback is its headphone its of cheap quality it should have being least decent quality.thats it so my review is go for it if u are looking for low budget smartphone having higher specs.
i just got the phone in 3 days from the date of booking and to say about the smart phone moto go it was good in performance but we cannot find all the features where we can find in other phone like riding unwanted applications in the menu not getting full picture of contact when someone calls us.
to go to the x room that the camera offers digital it takes many attempts.
i liked the moto go camera.i used nexus 4 before but moto go camera quality is very good.

have been using for over 3 months till now no issues like hanging or heating as such other than battery running out soon when using os network but that just andros & moto's way of telling you keep your charger close by phone comes loaded with most of the features which are generally abundant in all other bands so not much to tell camera is decent so is the dual sterno speakers they are loud but who plays music on mobile phone speakers other than plug the headphones.picture quality is clear & bright even when the brightness is turned down a lot.
camera quality is very fine.

it have a great front facing camera (2mp), nice seizing smooth software looking forward to lollipop!!).but also includes a great data counter and a useful torch it could maybe run a little faster and it have some bursa but with the update of lollipop, i think most of them would be solved can watch moves and series easily the sound is great, i love the fact that the speakers are in the front so you can hear everything the resolution of the screen is great please dont compare it to a retina display is not obvious the same)the size is perfect for medial the camera is really good have installed at least 72 apply and when it gets lagged i adjust the animation on developer mode and all solved love this phone offers a lot for a good price.you should get a good cases and forget a little in the aestethics, because of the cuts in the material investments that motorola does on this honest you can really regret if you just use it with no cases.

i bought this phone 3 months ago which i consider is enough testing time first with the kit at andros version it comes with and then with the lollipop andros version both of them run smoothly on the phone which is fast and has a great performance even when it runs out of memory for more apes i accept i exaggerated installing stuff i didn need but i was testing the camera both back and front have a very nice resolution the gorilla glass screen really works (really!.there no need of using a screen protector if you plan to use the phone with the usual care its not heavy and for those of you that are not completely sure of using a phone with these dimensions believe me once you have it in your hands you are not giving it away the screen size makes it very comfortable to write see pictures and video the battery life is good it takes a long time to get fully charged os to 4 hours but for me it works fine i use it a lot and it last more than 12 hours until you need to activate the battery saving mode.

camera is bad should improve camera quality.camera is bad should improve camera quality.
the shone is performing very well but one peculiar thing is being experienced that is during charging of mobile from normal charger supplied by the motrola the phone is opening the camera called list darling some numbers,opening the weather report on its own and unless the charging is stopped it is not coming back to normally.
camera is upgrade and reloaded with new features 4.
good with internal storage of 16 by as compared to the price the performance of the cell is good.coming to the cam clarity is not good it must be some what better.
too cost only 1 go ram , cam should be better , only 2070 may battery better to go for lucia 640 or 640 ll.
the camera is an imp shorter which is a disappointment but i can live with it.i gave it 4 stars because of the camera but wanted to give it 4.75!.
its a good device but within 7 months the camera flash stopped working.
very good mobile,speed battery and camera clarity is awsome,super mobile at this price can take mobile blandly without any hesitation.
camera quality not good at all.
* the rear camera is awesome with some amazing low light capturing abilities.the same can be said for the front camera which produces decent pick.the features included in the camera do full justice.* screen size is 5 inches so you enjoy video and games quite comfortably.
satisfied with sound camera and battery.
camera works very good most of the time but some times not as good.
but on camera you have to patients for the sharp shots.
) os camera.where do i even begin the 8mp snapped is the standout feature of this device can record video in 720p only but that is not a let down images captured are brilliant and very much comparable to a low end dslr.the front cam is just the iting on the cake images are just as good.
camera is mediocre at best.edit: the main concerns is its super slow random deals people.
except battery and cam performance in night time everything going to be fine.

i haven done much in the way of multi-touch for testing but the little bit have encountered has gone just fine so i expect that it all works pretty well.having the may slot was a fantastic addition over the original moto os and frankly if you get something like a 32gb may cards your never going to feel like your running out of space.when i first got the phone i want sure how the camera quality was going to be as i was upbraiding from a phone with a 3.2 os camera so i didn think 8mp was going to be a humorous improvement.i haven done much in the way of multi-touch for testing but the little bit have encountered has gone just fine so i expect that it all works pretty well.having the may slot was a fantastic addition over the original moto os and frankly if you get something like a 32gb may cards your never going to feel like your running out of space.when i first got the phone i want sure how the camera quality was going to be as i was upbraiding from a phone with a 3.2 os camera so i didn think 8mp was going to be a humorous improvement.by old phone was sluggish at the best of times so even the 2mp front camera on the moto g takes fantastic pictures by comparison.the 8mp camera on the back focused well and takes great pictures for the typical person.of you really want high-quality pictures perhaps you should consider a proper camera but for a phone this does a great job was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the speakers.

it never gets handed while playing games online video or any other applications.there are some reviews that moto and men is being hot while playing games or online video but in my case it is not happened.
camera quality is not good as it is in foka lucia (>10 k ranges its taking long time to charge full (approx 6 hours which is not good at all.
camera quality needs a lot improvement.
of your looking for an everyday use smartphone and do not need very high performance nor various fancy features this is the ideal phone for you.for some looking for high speed internet it may lack os support this was not my cases as am not willing to pay for os internet anyway.i've primarily used the phone in germany with telekom (t-mobile) and in the usa with at&t and i have had no issues with it.the back camera is very capable and takes great pictures and battery life is good enough to last usually two days if reception is good and use is not intense and up to three days with little use.i've upgrade from a bony xperia, and found that one of the best benefits of the moto g is the absence of heavy pre-installed applications or a heavily customized user-interface by the manufacturer also present in most samsung smartphones and tablets).
the only problem is booming in an out of the camera - that actually trouble some.

the size is a funny thing - if you use it as navy system in the car or for picture viewing you want a big screen - if for phone usage or to put it in the pocket it should be smaller.

anyway this behavior didn really surprise me and i would expect that on other phones.if there is one drawback that i see with the phone it is that the camera is slow or finicky to focus.i am getting better at using it at first many photos i took were slightly blurred.but the camera is still ok, and i take plenty of pictures with it it was just a stumbling block at first.undoubtedly the $600 phone have better camera or rousing logic but him not willing to shell out that much for a slightly better camera.for what him getting and for the price i paid i think this is the best deal going.

i am writing this review after using moto g gen 2 for over 210 days and evaluation it on every parameter including battery life , performance , build quality sound quality , camera quality etc initially when i got this product it was working on mitka 4.4.4 and at that time the battery back and performance of this phone was pretty good.the front shorter of the device is ok for all your video calls and self but the images from the rear shorter are quite dull and lacks smoothness the dual firing speakers provide decent sound quality and are quite loud.
the phone has a very good camera at both front and back and the performance is also good.

without a budget-conscious option from apple i turned to the world of android and immediately got a ton of recommendations for the moto os having hands-on experience with some other lowered android phone like the os optimus, i was initially nervous i was signing on for a slowed-down experience and a phone bloated with tons of proprietary software but what i got instead was a speedy fun-to-use, and quite simply slightly mindblowing experience for someone who never had a smartphone that want at least a year old by the time it got into my hands.the phone is pretty much the perfect size fitting in every pocket comfortably but still feeling large and impressive when playing video.the rest of the pre-installed apes were all default android and google apply which i wont review in much detail since most peoples mileage will definitely vary on those feel less-than-qualified to give a detailed breakdown on things like the camera quality and processor speed but as someone who knows what ram is i can say that this phone makes a compromise in that area 1 os is a comfortable amount for any one thing you want to do and the phone is pretty intelligent about shutting down apes if the current pp is more memory-hungry than others.

by biggest disappointments are the following - phone gets heated up while on call - the fitting of the charger into the oh port is extremely tight(everytime you try plugging the battery you fear if you'll screw up the ports - battery is of poor quality takes long to charge - camera is obviously better on this one by motorola standards but still not much compared to other bands.

for example the phone camera is pretty good but adding goose camera from the playstore adds a bunch of cool features.overall, if your used to android this phone wont knock your socks off and its nothing fancy to look at but it does gain a considerable edge with android 5 and is a reliable phone.for example the phone camera is pretty good but adding goose camera from the playstore adds a bunch of cool features.overall, if your used to android this phone wont knock your socks off and its nothing fancy to look at but it does gain a considerable edge with android 5 and is a reliable phone.

its work well with kitkat,but after updated with lolipop performance laws a bit and battery problem increase.otherwise camera is superb and design and build quality is good.waiting for 5.1 update and i hope all problems will be corrected.

camera is oka not good for low lighting.i was using htc x for around 2 years and very happy with it specially with gaming & camera in low light but lost it few days back.
it does need a case in my opinion and i got a nice one from amazon that protects it well but doesn add to the size of it much.i've never been one who was interested in watching couture video or anything but this moto g has such a dynamic screen and such great sterno speakers now i canst resist.
west in class camera guaranteed upgrade to lollipop and yes full day battery . . .

* front cam is not impressive if you take a lot of selfish.and camera pp is buggy.* price a little higher(2000 may be considering the processor and graphics card and chisel same as moto os * almost doubled the price of moto e for just camera and bigger display.
the camera is good and the best thing is it has expandable unlike moto g st men.
and the camera clarity just awesome even if in the night.
i am satisfied with this product , camera quality awesome.

i am happy with other features of phone its looks and performance is very good liked the camera too but why is showing total space of 12.79 by.
of your are a heavy camera.its video recording seems to have a problems.it bump suddenly from bright to dark video recording and this continues if lighting conditions vary very rapidly.like if you move your camera very much then it will surely happen.os its a video or image or music then just go to gallery and you will find it.
screen size storage processor camera all problems solved.
heating issues during call and all application installed via goose play gets corrupted and photos stored in os card gets delete automatically replaced the product 1 times and finally returned the product to flipkart.camera clarity depends on phone to phone.it was worst in the replace moto g than the earlier one.
god cam.only defect is the cam clarity at low light.
however camera quality isn impressive.
i got this phone for my wife because she wanted a bigger screen and i was pleasantly surprised i ended up wanting one for me i have a galaxy s4, which is superior but for this prices the moto is an excellent choice the colors are crisp and beautiful the speakers are facing up which is great since you actually hear ratification sounds when placed on a flat surface the battery life is more than decent the camera take beautiful pictures the ratification bar is a bit annoying since you have to click twice to get all the information but most of the little kinds you can solve by installing a good launched from goose play i can believe this phone is this good for this prices you can go wrong.
him sure video will drain it faster.
the build quality and camera are good.

3)camera-both the front and back camera is very good.picture quality is very sharp and colour tint and quality of the pictures are very rich.low light pictures are also good .7)gaming and os video recording is not excellent but it is good and met my expectation is certainly better than samson phone under 20 k 8)16 b internal memory and applications take less phone memory when transferred to external memory card since the andros is vanilla and original from goose in the device like nexus.9)speakers is simply superb and video call quality is also very much satisfactory sons os battery back up is not as good as moto g 1.
good video layer 2.
good camera .
the moto g improves on what its processor lacked micro os card slot,beautiful os inch display and 8mp camera .gros -5" display front speakers are loud n clear no network or call drops -8mp camera takes amazing pictures when hdr mode is on micro os slot up to 32gb bones there were no bones in the device whatsoever but the charger shipped with this phone heat up like a often rocky.
2)camera lens is better in this price 3)in low light condition it works good took.
camera clash light - sometimes the flashlight doesn turn off even after taking photo we need to start the device.
overall review * build quality is superb * sterno speakers give superb audit experience * battery is average * camera is some for this prices both front and heard * shone is more handy compared to other phone with os display * ram should've been better but canst complain because of its budget price * processor is awesome .

screen size resolutions camera clarity with auto focus option are awesome.
- camera is great - includes many goose built apes - 1 go ram is sufficient if you are not a terrific game - light weight - battery back is sufficient sons - takes unto 2-3 his to get fully charged - battery gets drained faster is data is on - gets i little bit of hot if used continuously for a long time overall i would like to say that moto g and gen is a good mobile in the prices if your budget is that much.

bones do come with better performance than this but above 2 points have to be compromised in that case and when u have a tight budget cons according to me could have been designed with thinner bells camera is very grain in indoor lights not designed for lollipop cannot handle phone will become slow and too much baggy cannot handle heavy multi taking and even some heavy webster will cause your come to crash sometimes.

the ratification pull down is refreshing with a whole new transparent look but the moment you open pp drawer its got this white background with ugly big icons as if you've installed windows on os but forgot to install video drivers.it gives only 2 shortcuts by default camera and phone.amazing camera clarity and ram is too good.
shone is too good,nothing much to speak about the negative in terms of performance and camera quality.but the display screen is not a quality one.it just broke when it fall from a 2.5 ft bed.which we did not expect.

last and main if you use camera at least 2 min it heat up super fast in 1 min and due to heating problem full battery drop in 6 - 7 hours.moto g,2nd generation is much better battery performance than us zenfone os one more good feature is front camera in moto and generation , asus is much slim then moto .i used this phone to fulfill all my requirements such as accepting my corporate private email whatsapp, social medial taking long video conferencing calls accepting my office network and receiving calls on my telephone etc.most office hours it was owned by my daughter who is very fond of watching couture video.it gave me very good uninterrupted video quality.
it has plenty of good features but battery power only about 2100mah is quiet less when working on os connections , also front camera disappoint me it has to be least 5mp at this range where other good mobile in this range provide this .
the rear camera is great.i was able to capture amazing shots in daylight think the front camera is also decent.the big screen was perfect for watching youtube video.drowsing is fast and video streaming by which i mean youtube) streams smoothly without stitches which adds to the big screen experience.his one had the best reviews though the other bands sport one or other better features like os or 13 os camera.

the os slot is super helpful and camera is a big improvement from last years.
by experience with the phone so far has been neutral after much hoped reviews and couture video.

google maps ensure you do not get lost in your backward and the camera ensures you can tell your friends over whatsapp if you do get lost.
its better from st men moto g in terms of screen size expandable memory and camera.
camera is also pretty decent better than i expected.even though this doesn come with g lte, it still does hspa+ and i can get ~7mbps where i live which is plenty for web searching and streaming os video.
now about phone it still heat up but lesser than earlier ones heavy,camera is average and those who want specially a camera phone dont buy it and the spaekers,they are excellent for hearing a song but when u call or someone calls u the voice go out and u constantly need to lower the volume but.the good thing is and only good thing is for which u can buy it that it doesn hang and the andros is very fast.so choose wisely.now about phone it still heat up but lesser than earlier ones heavy,camera is average and those who want specially a camera phone dont buy it and the spaekers,they are excellent for hearing a song but when u call or someone calls u the voice go out and u constantly need to lower the volume but.the good thing is and only good thing is for which u can buy it that it doesn hang and the andros is very fast.so choose wisely.
the camera is better than last years model but the screen looks less vibrant, lots of bags with lollipop 5.0.2 and the battery is woeful.i watched a hour movie and that took down 52 of battery on full brightness.

the screen is crisp the camera is amazing for this price range performance-wise it is pretty dark fast at launching apes and graphics and ram intensive games run without any last.

although the memory is only 8 os you are able to save the majority of apply music and photos on the os card that allows you to have about 3-4 go of free space.the breakthrough was undoubtedly the camera that has grown from 5 to 8 myxo.
i purchased this phone only reason is that to get regular update there are so many negative points in this phone it dont record full he video also it has very less may battery which drains pretty first after playing some high end games and heat up too much which is unbearable at times.
the camera clarity is too good.
the screen is bright and clear text and video look very good.the camera is good the few pictures have taken look fine.
his phone is very good with its shining features like go ram , 16gb internal storage , imp camera etc working good with good battery power.
there are a lot of video over the internet which tell that moto g first variant is far better than this one in terms of build quality display and sound i senate these claims.camera is great for this price os mp), still not as good as lucia 730, but its too good for a normal user.
camera is good doesn't hangs which is a very important thing nowadays interface is great touch is very good it very reasonable price.
i take photos and surf the web and use only a couple of apes (instagram,feedly, youtube, etc.but for the prices and to know that i am no paying the high service price for verizon, the phone is great.as for the camera it is good enough for me.all i use it for is to take some photos of my family for which it is good enough.the photos are similar is quality of the samsung siii which i came from.the moto g also has better call quality then the siii.sure,it does not have os service but os is plenty good enough for loading couture video and surging the web.so, if you want to get on a os gsm repaid carriers this phone will get the job done.
