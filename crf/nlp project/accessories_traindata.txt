charger port not working after some usage 3.
no us cable flipkart super fast awesome service.
os can not keep charger always on & then use "mobile" shone.
accessories: stock headphone could have been canalphones instead of earphones.but sound quality is good would have provided with a data cable for charging with lawton scant always expect power source in the whole him now a moto fan.
the charger came along with moto g was not working.it has been two months now still they are replacing the charger.but not sure whether flipkart expects me to use the phone without a charger eating for flipkart service phone charger and not for the phone as such.but not sure whether flipkart expects me to use the phone without a charger eating for flipkart service phone charger and not for the phone as such.
mobile is good but the quality of charger and earphones are not worthy.in fact the charger was not working after one week of purchase.
disappointed with no usb cable.
plus - good package that comes with headphone with mid and power adapted.
an anybody tell me if skullcandy headset is supported by this device or not.
the worst part is the charger its slow charge.it is 500mah charger while most charges are rate at 1000mah-2000mah.people buying this phone consider to buy a charger with 1am-1.5am.or if you own a microusb charger then use that.
i ordered two phone separately on big billion day and was skeptically whether i would get it fast or not.eventhough i received one faster than the other flipkart still delivered them before the promised date.have been using the phone for a day.feels good and perform good.overall good product.my only complaint would be that the moto people could've made data cable and charger as separate units.i ordered two phone separately on big billion day and was skeptically whether i would get it fast or not.eventhough i received one faster than the other flipkart still delivered them before the promised date.have been using the phone for a day.feels good and perform good.overall good product.my only complaint would be that the moto people could've made data cable and charger as separate units.
charger is not so good for fast charge.
to keep the cost of the phone unfordable the charger, head phone are not of the quality make.motorola instead of supplying these happy ones should have given option to the customers to select the charge head phone and usb cable from their quality products with specifications,keeping the cost of the phone separately.i am using foka charger and bony head phone which are excellent in their performance than the happy supplied with the box item.
also the charger is like first gen and still there is no usb chord.
by findings os plug the charging pin to mobile and plug the charger to mains.once the mobile hung by showing battery fully charged but when you switch off the charger its only 58%.
the white charger given is not at all friendly with the device.it is too tight for the devices charger ports.it is too tight for the devices charger ports.
many people say its charger is not heated during charging.

but this phone once i opened and started using am getting wire burnt smell in us port and in headphone ports.but this phone once i opened and started using am getting wire burnt smell in us port and in headphone ports.
regarding the battery i think it is excellent with prolonging cell lasts me 8-9 hours for example every day i get up at 7 and discontent the phone from the charger immediately and lasts me until 8-9 night if you want to know an example right now is 8:34 and my battery percentage is 26%.usually difficult to find the available cell but sent it quickly brings the box manual and charger longer than normal charges bone os they say everything in it is excellent i thoroughly recommend for some reason he is the king of the midrange.
i canst understand what to do the phone without usb cable.my phone color is black and i got white colored headset.it looks awkward who i wear headset.even charger color also white.
sound quality good camera good charger heat up mobile heated up and can talk when mobile phone is on charge bc the steel plate on mobile having current.
looks wise it is beautiful with curly edges performance wise awesome , all the apes and games are running smoothly without stitches , no us cable friends , they have given a universal us port so you can connect any us cable.looks wise it is beautiful with curly edges performance wise awesome , all the apes and games are running smoothly without stitches , no us cable friends , they have given a universal us port so you can connect any us cable.

with this phone you get 0.5a charger which takes 6-8 his to fully charge the phone.
his is the worst service that one could ever think off.the product i receive is damaged and also doesn include all its accessories and the only available accessory is the charger which is white in colour while the phone is black.hence i doubt if i have received a used phone or a phone which was returned by someone else.and the phone ordered is black in colour and the only available accessory is the charger which is white in colour.
also it dont come with a connection cable is if u dont have one from an old phone then that going to be a problems.
first of all the package doesn't have a usb cable inside that bad thing would have happened if they provided a charger with a removable data cable i wonder so be ready to buy one along with the phone.first of all the package doesn't have a usb cable inside that bad thing would have happened if they provided a charger with a removable data cable i wonder so be ready to buy one along with the phone.first of all the package doesn't have a usb cable inside that bad thing would have happened if they provided a charger with a removable data cable i wonder so be ready to buy one along with the phone.next all of the data cable dont work on this phone.while buying choose a wired data cable in stead of a two wired one (can't write details here space is limited.to summarize the pro and sons rose value for money excellent looks beautiful display recent performance unless you load it up with 5-6 apes running simultaneously lollipop upgrade very good camera sons video call not available an be done through third party apes like type but not possible directly to usb cable sometimes data cable might dispatch and although charging internal storage wont be shown in os headphone provided isn good speaker volume is not very high sound quality good enough though volume rocket and power button nobles a bit could have done better battery lockup not decent will increase fairly once upgrade to lollipop) takes long time to charge (don't use your phone while charging that will lessen it the sons do have a way of compensation so to me overall a fantastic phone considering the budget.to summarize the pro and sons rose value for money excellent looks beautiful display recent performance unless you load it up with 5-6 apes running simultaneously lollipop upgrade very good camera sons video call not available an be done through third party apes like type but not possible directly to usb cable sometimes data cable might dispatch and although charging internal storage wont be shown in os headphone provided isn good speaker volume is not very high sound quality good enough though volume rocket and power button nobles a bit could have done better battery lockup not decent will increase fairly once upgrade to lollipop) takes long time to charge (don't use your phone while charging that will lessen it the sons do have a way of compensation so to me overall a fantastic phone considering the budget.to summarize the pro and sons rose value for money excellent looks beautiful display recent performance unless you load it up with 5-6 apes running simultaneously lollipop upgrade very good camera sons video call not available an be done through third party apes like type but not possible directly to usb cable sometimes data cable might dispatch and although charging internal storage wont be shown in os headphone provided isn good speaker volume is not very high sound quality good enough though volume rocket and power button nobles a bit could have done better battery lockup not decent will increase fairly once upgrade to lollipop) takes long time to charge (don't use your phone while charging that will lessen it the sons do have a way of compensation so to me overall a fantastic phone considering the budget.
os sound quality good os rigid body sons os no g video call the to use rd party pp os data cable not provided os file manager is not in menu have to download from play stores.
was quite dissatisfied with the accessories for i received white colour normal speaker for a 13,000 worth products and white charger for my black mob and usb was not included.
price is comparatively lesser os however war phone is worst and even charger doesn seem of good quality.
mobile is good but the quality of charger and earphones are not worthy.in fact the charger was not working after one week of purchase.
