only one drawback battery charger given by motorola is not good does not fix to socket properly i tried all types of sockets but it dose not fix properly.

memory card not detecting, getting seated hanging problem too much battery back is not at all good.
his is an awesome phone to lag video quality is superb , battery is good.
battery back is average but not bad.to heating problems at all only thing is motorola should increase the ram of this mobile to at least 2 os for advance users those usually use more applications and games.
perfect sure android, with guaranteed update to android os by only concern is the battery life as it has dropped 10% in 45 minutes maybe due to continuous download of apes and update through wifi.

the battery back is very much impressive it is too good when used in lollipop version the screen is gorilla screen it breaks when falls down but no warranty given for physical damage or liquid damage for phone only software warranty is given.
playing james faster , os video playing very clear , round is better battery is also long performing !!!!.
battery consumption is more while using single sim.

in battery it might be slight drawback.battery is almost good.
its has only 2000mh battery which is lower than the version 1.
camera quality os poor.also fixed battery which may create problem os mobile gets wet os water os other liquid.
camera on both sides are decent enough resolving enough details.although, in some other phone , the front camera is more focused on selfish but the one in moto os is decent enough for video chats and casual selfies.and yeah i feel that the battery could have been a bit better.
good product from motorola for moto go and the ram should have been 2 go and g let is missing and battery should have been 3500 may for greater back up.
i'm using it 4 days ago and the battery is nice today have shared music through bluetooth to my car for about 2 hours full volume then in the job i was listening music from cells maybe 4 hours(wifi enabled navigable about 1 hour.at the end of the day cell battery consumption was less then 25%.i'm using it 4 days ago and the battery is nice today have shared music through bluetooth to my car for about 2 hours full volume then in the job i was listening music from cells maybe 4 hours(wifi enabled navigable about 1 hour.at the end of the day cell battery consumption was less then 25%.

part from that its a very nice phone, good battery back-up, until you remember to charge your phone full before switching os os for the first time!.
the sons the headphone provided is not that good not happy with it the battery should have been a little more accessories such as us cable not provided.
they were also happy with the overall performance ( warring now performance of battery ) os but post system updated in android 5 , we all are facing problems like slow processing, phone hanging etc.hope the developer soon resolved such issues on moto g2.
his mobile is very good speed battery back up and awesome speaker sound.

not the delivery before the due date good service flipkart now about the phone screen is great voice is clear but the battery back is not up to the mark took wise good phone but bit body type overall its good having this set m disappointed with the accessories i got in the box headphone is really bad charger is so slow that it charges 10 to 100 in 4 hours other side i ordered the black phone and got the white charger and the headphones.
well thought that i m going to have a good phone.but after a few days it sucks.not only the performance even the battery back also suddenly dropped.but the only plus point is its camera and its sound built.
all features are god in this phone but battery life is too short and sometimes there is also some speaker problem while calling.
very good sound system battery good but not best.heating problems.
the charger came along with moto g and gen is extremely slow it takes almost 4 to 4.5 his to charge the phone completely once i used samsung's galaxy pocket dues charger and it charges the battery from os to 75 % within 45 to 55 mind.the only problem is its battery takes almost 4 hours to get charged by its original charge on the other hand on using galaxy y charges it takes 2:30 to 3 hours to charge.
the battery back up of this mobile is just useless it drains fast.
by biggest worry was and is the non-replaceable battery.otherwise battery life seems good so far.
os moto go is an optimized phone on its original model moto go but phone battery back is not optimized at all and it last only for one day.

the battery is really very very bad and it is not worth the money.

i bought it 1 month before i had problems with speaker and battery.
rose fantastic saw & hardware latest os updated from goose sons a little poor battery performance all in all a fantastic phone.
vice phone for given money smart phone do have heating problem and moto is not the unique one.it does the heating problems.

i needed an unlocked phone because my htc one mind essentially didn have a battery anymore would turn off within three hours plugged without so much as turning on the screen once.
now am getting only 6-7 hours battery back and its taking more than 4 his to charge 100%.

writing this review after using it for around a month now gros simple lag free ui will get ota lolipop soon way better than asus zenfone great voice clarity awesome dual speakers up front premium build with nice rubberised finish at the back wonderful camera front and back battery is good enough depends on your usage does get me through the day on mixed usage sons symmetric design makes it difficult to predict if you are holding it upside down os verdict to for it i bet you wont regret !.
battery - also much better than on nexus os easily lasts a day with moderate/heavy use takes 1.5 hours to get a full charge.8).people even mistake it for a samsung galaxy phone sometimes that how good it looks!update - december 21im still very much impressed with the phone just wanted to add a couple of things i noticed:1) it now takes a little longer to charge from 0 to 100% - 2 hours versus 1.5 when new;2) the battery doesn last as long as when i bought it but still close to a full day with moderate/heavy use pages load just a bit slower;3) the camera is really very good.
speed is good camera quality k battery back up ok touch experience awesome.
i would have given 5 stars if the battery is replaceable.
in brief : screen quality : 5 star performance : 4.5 star dimension and ease to handle : 3.5 star require both hands to handle battery : 4.5 star charging time from 10% to 90% atleast) : 4 start round quality : 5 star speaker goodness : 5 star speaker quality : 5 star microphone and receiver quality : 5 star most : 4.5 star covers provided by the flipkart : 1 star os hats the only disappointment.
to battery backup.heating like a iron box.i tried to remove the back panel to separate the battery but no use.
camera quality is just too good battery is also good if there is 2gb ram instead of 1 os then it will be rockstar in this range of smartphone.
it only takes charge to the battery when it wants.
sons to basic file explorer that with kitkat) should have provided additional data cable that with moto and not with the phone 2070 may battery not enough for this smartphone.
battery life is good but heat unto uncomfortable levels.
the battery last two days for my kind of usage.

after using the phone for 5-7 days i experienced major technical faults with the phone like the battery was draining way too fast.moreover the phone switched off and the battery drained to 0 percent in 1 see from 81 percent.
but found my battery drained up fast and also takes lot of time to get full charged.
battery back up is so poor hangs sometimes except this phone is good display quality is good camera are good.
i like the look,sound,touch and its fast response but the battery life some how disappointed me.
battery is very good.
must perfect and as i have seen earlier review regarding battery issue i dont have any problem like that as my phone easily run by one time charge.
caution to not update to v5.0.2 lollipop due to bags somewhere in the software battery life is passively decreased and you would hardly get 1-2 hours of screen on time.
only sons i can talk about are ~ first the battery.in heavy usage using internet battery can lasts unto 7-8 hours.

i will give 4 star because battery is only lasts for 1 day ice on total using of 6 to 7 hours without playing d or racing game.
sons battery back is not that great.
love it awesom hands in my budget battery back good camera awesom display awesom response awesom looks awesom games mast had santa bus time nasi milka thank motorola and also to flipkart for delivering this in just 3 days.
but in the second new one i have purchased i faced heating issue and some problem on speaker.
sons considering the low price tags these are not actually sons but few areas motorola really need to work upon experienced some heating issues while using camera for more than 15-20 minutes -2070mah battery is not enough for os display we need to turn off auto-brightness many times in a day to save power.sons considering the low price tags these are not actually sons but few areas motorola really need to work upon experienced some heating issues while using camera for more than 15-20 minutes -2070mah battery is not enough for os display we need to turn off auto-brightness many times in a day to save power.
but the problem ism facing is the battery drains way quicker than usual.
the phone delivers on all the promises it is good looking sturdy with great screen decent camera and battery and plenty of processing power.build quality is excellent and i keep it in a case since new no screen protectors thought lasts 1.5 days on me easily so the battery is very good indeed.lack of a card slot is not a problems since i charge it form my lawton while in officer so transferring all extra files to os is easy and that before the clouds storage.it is a little low on ram- with the amount of s i installed it is 72-79% taken so i have to use dedicated apes to close all the apes in the background all the time.camera is worse than my other phone (nokia n86), but still ok for the price.overall, a very good deal compared to the phone my colleagues are using.in fact i ordered the new version of the os and this one is going to my son.
good hardware great took vice performance recent battery life a trustworthy brand - the software is very basic verdict west smartfone in the range.
by samsung gs3 served me well for 2 years but off late had become very baggy and the battery life had become quite bad.i purchased a new 2250 ah battery from raw but that did not help much.it seems the phone needed more battery after all the upgrade.good battery life can last through the day 2.of the samsung galaxy os had a dual sim option and a better battery life i would have made that my primary phone.
the most important issue or should i say the major con of this device is its battery.the former st gen moto g had the same 2070 may battery which the phonemaker should have increased but unfortunately it did'nt.to the battery lasts for a closely fair 1 day upon your usage.
battery back up is worst when internet is on.
i bought a moto g and the battery charger doesn work after just a few days(march 25-2015).
the phone is working well but my battery cannot last it for at least one day with minimum usage of you travel long with this phone definitely you need to carry power back up so bit irritating.
overall this phone can handle your daily tasks as long as you dont go crazy and the battery life will last almost a full day of you are not a crazy power user.final thoughts that is pretty much the end of my review and the moto g is a great budget phone for people who need a back or who are just trying to save some money but still want a great phone.
the only con i faced is battery.i still dont understand my bands limit the battery power so much .so if u love battery capacity this phone is not for up other then that the phone is v nice.
strangely enough the phone has occasional issues with the battery level indicator.
battery back up is oka.
moto g as name suggest its nice motto it really good to bye this mobile i got this product in discount of 1250,display camera everything is nice am enjoying it battery 16hr u will get.
rose excellent value for money strong battery life much-improved camera solid well-built design sons to os lte support to low-light photo average front-facing speakers.
hello all his is a pathetic product from motorola, it is very slow in response and has very poor battery back up.i got the product delivered on with may 2015 and today ice 24/08/2015 ice within 3 month i am facing battery issue.the battery hardly lasts for 4-5 hours even if you are not using it and your wife etc are off.
overall the worst product to buy have used different bands but the first time i bought moto g that full charge the phone only works for 9 o 10 hours without playing games or multimedia that 9 in morning i leave home at 100 % charge by 2 pm the phone has only 10% battery left this is only on normal usage worst experience os.
very low battery back moto g and gen.
battery last whole day(again not for heavy users.
- the battery back is the worst drains in a few hours.i am not evening using it more than 30 minutes a day - the speaker phone does not work - takes like 5 hours to charge completely by recommendation - os not buy this phone and save yourself a big trouble.
sons os battery life is not too high particularly when many pp are running simultaneously though it is normal case for all smart phones).
i am using moto g2.its battery back very weak and other features are very good.camera quality ropchik.
non-removable battery.
worssstttt battery backup.
worst quality phone worst battery backup.
previously used samsung galaxy grand though there were minimal problems i faced with it when i st saw this phone speck i just fixed my mind blandly to go up with this mobile seriously satisfied with the every aspect of mobile felt like there would have been a better battery performance not 2070mah though anything more than that would do the thing actually.
in i have purchased moto g 2 on with feb'15 after some days of using i noticed that while charging it take 3 to 4 hour for 100% battery charging.
nice battery back , improved after lollipop!.
i have got moto g and men through flipkart and on the same may its started to give problem like its heated up like often rock taking 16-17 hours to full battery charge its picture quality and led flash is so poor in compare to other lower cost mobile pictures are with reddish shade.i got very funny expert comments from flipkart technical team that heating of phone is a common phenomena and they can do anything.
camera is good and front camera is also good battery will last 10 to 12 hours.
the display is bright enough for regular use but dim enough to conserve battery when need be.
i ordered this mobile for my brother he is happy with the cheap and best features of the mobile but the only issue is battery backup.i wish they offered good battery backup.
just one small drawback if the battery would have been more powerfully.

there no need of using a screen protector if you plan to use the phone with the usual care its not heavy and for those of you that are not completely sure of using a phone with these dimensions believe me once you have it in your hands you are not giving it away the screen size makes it very comfortable to write see pictures and video the battery life is good it takes a long time to get fully charged os to 4 hours but for me it works fine i use it a lot and it last more than 12 hours until you need to activate the battery saving mode.there no need of using a screen protector if you plan to use the phone with the usual care its not heavy and for those of you that are not completely sure of using a phone with these dimensions believe me once you have it in your hands you are not giving it away the screen size makes it very comfortable to write see pictures and video the battery life is good it takes a long time to get fully charged os to 4 hours but for me it works fine i use it a lot and it last more than 12 hours until you need to activate the battery saving mode.
i switched from galaxy s which was giving me battery problems and the screen quality seemed to be degrading.recent battery life - i get 3-3.5 hours of on-screen time with 22+ hours on single charge on single sim.almost same as s 6.battery non-removable - if your device stops responding u may have a tough time overall it is a budget phone which will definitely not disappoint.
i have purchased the shone on dated 5-02-2015, but unfortunately phone slipped into the water on dated 9-03-2015, due the built battery of the phone we are unable to dry it immediately and service center in very far from my place we are unable to take to os on same day on next day i have taken to os of moto, he has take 300 os to check the phone and told it will not work and waste to invest the money on the phone to repair as i have purchased it for 12999 rs.(my advice os not purchase moto phones os all are inbuilt battery only) and no local service centers cannot help the phone as it is unique design.
mobile visual screen and processor is good but having very weak battery backup.
disadvantages battery back is poor,speakers and apiece not so good as the company claims sound is hollow and shattered on high volume,earphones are of cheap quality(plastic make but deliver good sounding data cable in package.

great speakers always have reception day-plus of battery life good back camera and feels natural.the phone is heavy which i prefer however for a smaller hand it may be too weary.
when it works its a fantastic value and awesome, but i had one arrive with a screen glitch, which was replaced by motorola, but the new one just fried its own removable battery.

i am very happy with the purchase sound battery and screen are good.
you also dont have any slot to plug in a pair of earphones to listen to music n stuff.a workaround for this would be to use a bluetooth enabled headset.meaning go tireless :)nevertheless, d still rate it 5 for its super voice quality and battery life!!!.

overall the phone is good with a battery life of a day good speakers.
battery sucks and it gets heated so quickly when charging do not know if flipkart delivered to me a defeated products.
only minus point it is the battery last for one day only.so main point is to improve is the battery.
with os internet the battery lasted for only 4-5 his.next day without using internet i just used for playing games listening songs and others for maximum time the battery lasted for a day.sincere request to motorola to somewhat concentrate on battery.his phone is awesome, i played games continuously for an hours the battery drained only 5-8%.to heating problems simply good in all perceptive.i love the pdf reader features(black on white to save battery and less impact on eye during night when all light switched off leading view option fits perfectly the text to screen but not figures manageable).

great phone with battery smooth ui.
can hear what the other person is telling and also he can hear what i am saying,bad quality speaker with full of jingling sound even when not in use,sim slot 1 was not detecting,automatic off,hanging,heating,wifi complaint etc.so its my request for people going to buy this not to buy motorola(brand) instead you can buy indian brands.if you are not believing me you can buy this.but.
after 15-20 minutes i observed that it was started heating up to an extend such that i can not put it on my ears.it was heating up.there is no heating issue at all 4 star for overall experience 1 star is deduced for multiple return request.
and battery performance is average overall very much satisfied with this phone for a price of os 12,999/-.
lastly the battery life is average but then it again depends upon use.

i bought moto os in the month of march with two months data free offer my mobile battery draining out very faster upon advice of flipkart executive i installed smart check the examined for 3 days they observed the same.
i brought this mobile on with see 2104 to sister birthday am very disappointed about this phone.because my old moto g phone is getting full signal strength in same place with same net work but this one is getting only 2 points and battery is too poor ice when phone is in ideal itself the battery reducing 30-40% in 3 hours.i brought this mobile on with see 2104 to sister birthday am very disappointed about this phone.because my old moto g phone is getting full signal strength in same place with same net work but this one is getting only 2 points and battery is too poor ice when phone is in ideal itself the battery reducing 30-40% in 3 hours.
the battery back is a bit low reasoning for the 4 stars.
of smart phone canst offer basic features like wider screen , expandable memory through microsd, os , sterno speakers , pure vanilla flavour of android with smooth battery performance and latest firmware upgrade and still cost up to 30-50k.
i thought that the battery would not last long at my first full use but it passes my test.it has a good battery even though its big screen.
used but still it laws some shortcuts.like data on - off,battery % is not there but for time being its annoying.
the battery drains too much hardly 6-8 hours of back with a os connection and takes a lot of time to charge mostly overnight charging.
battery takes lot of time to charge.
the battery back is good too however it will require charging each day.
the only down side to this phone for me is the non removable battery.
battery draining so fast in hot climate with g internet and very few calls.it is very good smart phone with poor battery backup.
the battery issue is genuine.but nothing is wrong with the battery.it only needs to celebrate to display the proper battery percentage.to a couple of complete recycle of the battery should do the trick.i drained the battery full then charged it 100% and did this two times.now i have no issues with the battery.it lasts 1 full day and still has about 25% remaining.c i do wish the battery was removable but most phone are coming with non removable ones so that is fine.
even though the shocking thing is long battery life.
m using this phone for about 1 month and its really grm battery lasts for a day fast interface superb quality.just go for it os.
good camera touch also very good battery back for normal user charge 1 time in a day for heavy user charge 2 times.overall.ave battery back up performance wise it lawless best in its range now it available 10k in this range u can find better than this so dont think if u want to buy phone around 10k go for moto go.
very good and nice battery back some.phone is regarding his battery.
performance good all disadvantages of moto os gone.only disadvantage remain is its battery life.
must the battery life is average and button on the screen not look so good while operating.
battery was showing 10% remaining and after connecting to os charger it came up to 100% in 30 mind.
(u can get a otg from any phone shop at 50-60 bucks battery and connectivity the new moto g is furnished with the regular conductivity features like 3g, dual sim shots wi-fi, bluetooth, gps and usb ports.for running the show for a decent amount of time the smartphone relief on a 2,070mah lesion battery which runs phone approximately for whole day.about 19-20hrs of battery back on 2g.
cons: battery life is one day rose good speed , ram and processor speed good phone does not hang and i can download and use multiple sessions effortlessly.
however sometimes the battery lasts less than four hours on a charge and rarely more than ten.
a good mobile with handy size good camera 4.4 version with goose talk is very nice it make the phone easier to search email sms, where voice recognizes very fast , still needs fine tune up but as on date it is okay am giving 4 star because battery take very long time to charges i used the bony expedia , but one day software just cold off and is unable to repair.
over all phone is good average battery life.sometimes heating problems.over all phone is good average battery life.sometimes heating problems.
u cannot expect high graphics games on this other wise this phone is good one cam is good sound is awesome was its sterno speakers did a very nice impressive quality battery is average normal use of g with average use would stand it alive for 12 hours which is quite good most important and plus point of this phone is its software ui lollipop experience.
vice performance naming battery backup, will date i have not experienced any slow performance or any last.
quick joints * battery drains too fast but this issue has been fixed after a update provided by moto * shone is not very good at ram management.
> the touchscreen is battery smooth and the response is great.not that great yes it is loud but not really clear > battery standby is not up to the marked.not that great yes it is loud but not really clear > battery standby is not up to the marked.to battery honestly not good not even close to good would have been better even in this price range maybe with the lollypop updated we could expect more > stock andros experience is great still waiting for lollypop updated > the sensory yes they work good.of you are a heavy user strictly dont buy this considering the price and specie i would rate it 4.75 os in stars of not for the battery i would have rate it 5.
battery is a slight problem drains out in a day.
battery back up is worst.
by views pros:- the battery life which is the most important aspect is pretty good.
camera and battery could have been better.
battery in os mode is not good enough for day long use.any times it gives problems & its very hard os battery back is not good for heavy usage.but if you are a ave phone user then its ok os when taking images that have good and punch colours but the details are missing even in 8mp and little problem is the presence of noise in close-up shot and indoor pictures.
worst battery drops down to empty with below average use in 8 his 4.
battery draining is a major issue which can be fixed by motorola, if they want.i am bearing this product.with heating problem and bad quality of front camera.

the operation is battery smooth despite 1gb ram.good battery discharge lasts me almost an entire day close to 17-20 hours with wifi/data on whatsapp, facebook and twitter on while listening to music.
to bloatwear, better battery life that my s4, lollipop is simple and smooth for my wife who is not a power user or very techie.after about 2 weeks the phone went dead and my wife thought she had plenty of battery life.but him so disappointed in the experience and what really others me is the fact that i could take the battery out and rest the phone that way.
it is very good at performance and design but only thing was heating problems.
with eyes closed.its camera is superb,you get photos of great quality like photos of 13 os camera.only i thing i didn like is its battery back up.but that also doesn give u any problem u can work with the mobile for whole day if you charge it once in the morning.you can play awesome games like asphal* and many other games.
only two things will be dis appoint to you that battery back up is very poor you can use only 12-15hrs with one full charge.

the only drawback is low battery back up and updated lollypop is not allowing any external matter bolster apps.
but the phone battery back is not good in a day you have to charge twice.
os the screen is bright enough and the picture quality and sound quality is very decent the drawback with this phone are os door battery back os stock accessories supplied with the phone.

fantastic phone in terms of performance clarity of display style and features.smooth to operate.only battery back up is not highly effective but its still ok i would say.
moto g and generation mobile excellent speed and screen good internal non removable battery only - for this product remaining all excellent.
i have used this phone since two months its battery is perfect for 1 day use if u have moderate usage of games.that means practically the battery will remain at constant level.
camera not good though 8 up battery drains within 12 he with g browsing i he it received my returned item .
i bought this phone 2 months back.performance and battery back is so nice.
battery is the biggest problem in this mobile.i have been using moto g earlier version which has better battery performance other than that all are good except u r mobile signal will go down once in some days and u have to report the mobile to fix it .(very less occurrence ) touch is good as it used to be.better check for battery power bank before getting it.
os not go on the face publicity of this product as i was also disappointed to see the bad quality product especially from moto an american grand but chinese made go for other chinese option xiaomi or huawei , bad battery back up worse speaker quality.
all is good but battery back is the worst.

battery issues are there needs a lot improvement.
of your looking for an everyday use smartphone and do not need very high performance nor various fancy features this is the ideal phone for you.for some looking for high speed internet it may lack os support this was not my cases as am not willing to pay for os internet anyway.i've primarily used the phone in germany with telekom (t-mobile) and in the usa with at&t and i have had no issues with it.the back camera is very capable and takes great pictures and battery life is good enough to last usually two days if reception is good and use is not intense and up to three days with little use.i've upgrade from a bony xperia, and found that one of the best benefits of the moto g is the absence of heavy pre-installed applications or a heavily customized user-interface by the manufacturer also present in most samsung smartphones and tablets).
-0.5 star for high sar value -0.5 star for something that makes feel quality downgrade initially i rate 3 stars now i increased the rating to four stars due to improved battery back after the lollipop updated.updated 20/02/2015: after the lollipop update, the battery seems to be lasting more or should i say far more.-0.5 star for high sar value -0.5 star for something that makes feel quality downgrade initially i rate 3 stars now i increased the rating to four stars due to improved battery back after the lollipop updated.updated 20/02/2015: after the lollipop update, the battery seems to be lasting more or should i say far more.
poor battery back not at all satisfied with moto mobile.
the only thing i dislike about this phone is that it has built battery.
i called their customer care and asked:>>>>: q my phone is heating up so fast.
the only things that this phone lack is a good battery back and a nice set of earpieces.
first the battery is lasting me as it was lasting when the phone was new.
you will definitely see bluish screen on urea where as in moto os the display is clear vivid and battery smooth.
am using this as my primary phone and listening music playing game using wife and getting full day battery backup.
his is really outrageous that once flipkart delivered me the defeated product which was having too much heating issue and now the piece which have been delivered to me after replacement is a piece of june.
good gazing temple run no lag battery on an average it comes for a day.sometimes call drop i had no experience of charger heating as mentioned by others.
camera is good but the only desert is its battery.
gprs and mobile network data with net use would kill the battery fast to be careful and use wisely.
battery life does not last very long kind disappointed on this one.the phone itself is great but volume goes from low to high and battery life sucks.
average touch battery back not good both him not working in g mode.
round probe network issue touch not responding and battery pathetic from starting.
battery gets discharge more faster than the time taken to charge.
- battery shows 100%, after the use(shows in correct - after receiving call getting some disturbing voice.

battery is of 2070 may same as the first generation but is ok for this phone works all working day 7.it should have more battery it is 15% less than the first gen moto g because of 5 inch screen 3.it's arousing speed decreases with 5-4 tabes running at a time causing camera for about 10 to 15 min decreases the battery percentage 7.
points 1)good display 2)real video recording & voice in recording is totally original 3)battery back is nice.

moto provides the same features in a comparatively lesser price.the only setback is the battery capacity.it is not very bad but could have been better.battery is good if os is not used.if used also it stands for about 14 his.
i purchased this phone 3-4 weeks ago from lip part and had done analysis for all pro and cost here is my observations by comparing samsung galaxy - gros - good battery display is awesome, camera is unbeatable.very good quality for pick and making moves processing speed is far better than samson sons - all recorder does not work which is my requirements.
the battery with my personal usage lasts about 1-1/2 to 2 days while being to use for checking email twitter playing a few games watching plex/youtube/twitch, and reading a few webster forms.really impressed i can only imagine how crazy the battery life on the st generation moto g was compared to the and genu.

want comment on the battery life as of now but it has gone pretty strong for the past 6 his of my moderate usage.
also nice that it has a micro slot.disadvantage is that both shots are only accessible when back cover removed and removing the back cover can be somewhat tricky wish it had a replaceable battery so one could easily swap out but no battery is built-in.also nice that it has a micro slot.disadvantage is that both shots are only accessible when back cover removed and removing the back cover can be somewhat tricky wish it had a replaceable battery so one could easily swap out but no battery is built-in.
i am using this shone from 3 months i have not got any problem like hang, battery let os restart which i faced when i was using samsung phone.the only think i dont like about this shone is on he movable battery west all the best features hoping buy back offer when new phone's of moto is launched.and plates for moto g as well.
the only con in this phone is the very average battery life.
not to mention the battery backup.
battery performance is very poor.it will take minimum 3 to 4 hours to charge the battery.

were are my review --- - battery - it takes nearly3-4 his to charge and lost in 7-8 mrs if constantly accepting internet than in 5 mrs tax.most concern is battery os of you are free whole day to charge and use then go for it.
battery life is oka it lasts about 8 hours with internet etc working and lollipop upgrade should improve upon that.
in contrast,the motorola's front facing camera is very crisp and clear.battery life i had 4 batteries for the htc, so i think you could safely assume that battery life on the htc was terrible.
all the specification are very good except battery.because the battery drains very fast.display is very good battery drains toooooooooo fast.and has a non removable battery.

of they change the battery model i can say moto g 2 is best smartphone.
battery performance is average.
touch super smooth.if the battery may increased another 500-1000mah it will be best.

i think this is the best phone for average person.the battery time on low use could last approximately 3 days and heavy use 1 day.
its sweet after the lolipop update but it has started lagging because of lolipop though it is battery smooth.of you want it for daily use its good battery back is good and boy the speakers are awesome i can say that they can beat htc's speakers but its truly a great experience having front facing sterno speakers overall smooth experience.
battery life for my level of usage will be about two full days.edit: 11/21/14 front facing speakers should be the standard.
the phone is not at its best.mainly it is overhearing and it doesn have a good battery life we can sait drains.better u go for panasonic p81ormotoe.

the only drawback is the battery backup.battery needs constant recharging.
though he informed about slight heating issues certain times but still great phone.
have been using this phone for three months now and i canst complain os the battery life has reduced because of the new lollipop update but still have to charge only once a day so its fine.

and the phone is heating up a little bit if we are calling for half an hours.
battery brain so fast.
os on for new hours and drowsing it will screw up the complete battery.i have requested flipkart for return and replace with new mobile and the customer care so called technical team tell me that if you switch on os and use mobile the battery will met trained very quickly.i feel flipkart is heating customers this way.for the worst ever battery and flipkart's worst return policy i rate this mobile with 1 star.
amazing build quality looks good battery lasts decently longer than the other did devices touch sensitivity is good and you get andros updated faster than any one else.
all of them bought the phone in the month of september & has their battery dead within 3-4 months.us not the phone to buy the phone has the worst battery & takes about 3-3.5 hours to get fully charged.
but i give it 4 because i dont at all like the battery backup.they could have given a bit more powerful battery.
dont worry battery could have been a wee bit better like say just a 500 more of may conclusion its more than worth the money.
very poor battery back and very bad service even though it is not fix in refund policy.
pro display is good on heating issue while charging.battery is not lasting for a day.

battery also could have been better.
awesome battery life lollipop, morning gorilla glass.
the touch is fantastic colors are crisp no lag in playing mid level games camera pictures has some noise in low light photography and battery drain will be fast for hardware user.
good battery life.
another major issue i have found with and generation which was not present in the earlier version is its battery life.the phone drains quite a lot of battery power even when it is idle.in checking which apes are draining the battery i found that well standby is taking lot of juice out of it next to screen - which obviously is the top battery consumer.in checking which apes are draining the battery i found that well standby is taking lot of juice out of it next to screen - which obviously is the top battery consumer.in checking which apes are draining the battery i found that well standby is taking lot of juice out of it next to screen - which obviously is the top battery consumer.to when you take your phone in the morning you will find that the battery is several notes down from what you left it in the night.this drainage issue was not there in the st genu.to all in all moto g and gen still remains the best phone to buy in this budget with some issues related to multitasking ability and battery life.
looks:-9/10 sound:- 8/10 performance:- 10/10 video playback os 10/10 touch:-100/10(if possible os camera:-7/10 front camera:- 8/10 battery backup:- 8/10 headphone:-2/10( quality is too bad like all moto h.ph, good things is you can use any 3.5mm jack high for your moto) voila glass 3 is superb.
great camera feels great display is awesome battery life is great and easy to use.
battery is top notch.
best points water-resistant, 16gb internal if u having battery draining problem than just rest or phone.
after two months of buying this device i am facing battery issues.suddenly the battery level drops to 1-2%.after two months of buying this device i am facing battery issues.suddenly the battery level drops to 1-2%.
very decent battery back up.
i plan to stick with the stock rom for the foreseeable future and use posed for mods.to conserve battery life both generations of the moto g are very dim with the default auto brightness settings.display accuracy seems to vary greatly from one phone to another but fwiw, these are measurement taken on my moto g:contrast ratio 1,555:1average color temperature (20% - 100%): 6855kgamma: 2.69grayscale average did 4.07color hecker average did 4.39max brightness 376 cd/m2 (110 fl)the contrast is typical for an lcd smartphone display and the color accuracy is fair.the coolness of the color temperature and undersaturation of colors are noticeable but the display looks pretty good overall.the speakers are an improvement over other phone have had but i dont have any experience with the acclaimed htc "boomsound" honest.micro support recent front-facing sterno speakers pretty decent display quality with a color temperature that is (thankfully) under 7000k, but display quality surely varies os radio - rarely found in phone these days and although i admittedly dont use it very often i do like to have the optioncons- low-end cpu, gpu and ram, none of which are upgrade from the st gen moto os the sealed battery is more difficult and costly to replace than a "user-replaceable" battery.micro support recent front-facing sterno speakers pretty decent display quality with a color temperature that is (thankfully) under 7000k, but display quality surely varies os radio - rarely found in phone these days and although i admittedly dont use it very often i do like to have the optioncons- low-end cpu, gpu and ram, none of which are upgrade from the st gen moto os the sealed battery is more difficult and costly to replace than a "user-replaceable" battery.micro support recent front-facing sterno speakers pretty decent display quality with a color temperature that is (thankfully) under 7000k, but display quality surely varies os radio - rarely found in phone these days and although i admittedly dont use it very often i do like to have the optioncons- low-end cpu, gpu and ram, none of which are upgrade from the st gen moto os the sealed battery is more difficult and costly to replace than a "user-replaceable" battery.i just replaced a battery in one of my other phone for $5.
comparatively good battery back ( os day with normal use of gazing calling,net surging & using whatsapp) ; camera quality s good.
the battery is not that great.
of some one is buying this for playing games then you should go for some other option (2000mah+ battery).giving it 4 start as disappointed with battery life.
pathetic would be a soft word for the battery this one has.2 months old and already passed off with the battery backup.even i phone give better battery performance.
rose display design round speed memory dual him etc. sons recent battery lockup for single day use (24hrs).
the battery back has been decent.the battery save mode on the lollipop os is another boon in case you intend to travel for an extended period.
battery back is average.
only problem battery backup.i think we can managed company could have upgrade battery capacity as they have increased display size.only problem battery backup.i think we can managed company could have upgrade battery capacity as they have increased display size.
sons battery is ok type although it works for me a whole day and sometimes 16-18 hours but what anybody can expect from a smartphone.when it comes to battery life all smartphones are more or less same.it depends on how you use it.sons battery is ok type although it works for me a whole day and sometimes 16-18 hours but what anybody can expect from a smartphone.when it comes to battery life all smartphones are more or less same.it depends on how you use it.
performance is to good as of now i download all required apes and didn any issue like heating hanging.to heating issue like mi4i, yureka.battery back is also good.
it at battery smooth with a more than adequate 5", 720p display and 8mp front facing camera.
its good performance is much better than the earlier version the only con is battery doesn last longer in this device.
a highly recommended budget smart phone , it never hands that the best part about it battery back is good and updated are coming for this model that a plus point.
battery does not last even 6 hours.its poorest battery i very seen in andros 4.
battery back is also good lasts 8 his on moderate usage of music gaming n internet but last 4 only 2 his on excessive g browsing.
and yes i have done the charging as the manufacturer recommends to recalibrate the battery.
i have been using this phone for 3 months now.its far better than any other phone of this price range os found many advantages like good sound effects and battery backup.all games are running smoothly without any heating problems.but i found that sometimes there is an echo during calls.
as my moto g first gen is more brighter than moto g second genu the battery obviously will also be used up with large screen so next time more boasted juice.
features and performance are key features little challenge u guns face with battery back.
the phone came with os battery life no bigger charged it up for 10 mind turned it on did my set up and as soon as i got to the main screen i got the lollipop updated.
moto g is a awesome product for the feel and touch related earlier was using samsung products and for the price range its a good deal but the concern is with the battery life which is too less comparatively 2070 may is not sufficient to complete entire days activity.
battery sucks waste phone you need to keep charging hours per day better wait for moto g 3 gen it will be released in the month of aug and sept.
coming to some noticeable disadvantages os the battery is not removable which makes it a problem to have a visit to service center if some problem occurs os the battery back of d phone on standby is great up in that but then if u use it for hardware gaming with wifi/mobile data continuous usage u wont b happy then os him a average user - os usage stats are mostly - iii on whole time for what pp instagram, facebook & decent gaming - his usage provides me around 10-11 hours of battery back with screen on-time usage of around 4 his min or 5 hours which is no doubt great thing when u use net dont expect battery to b great.coming to some noticeable disadvantages os the battery is not removable which makes it a problem to have a visit to service center if some problem occurs os the battery back of d phone on standby is great up in that but then if u use it for hardware gaming with wifi/mobile data continuous usage u wont b happy then os him a average user - os usage stats are mostly - iii on whole time for what pp instagram, facebook & decent gaming - his usage provides me around 10-11 hours of battery back with screen on-time usage of around 4 his min or 5 hours which is no doubt great thing when u use net dont expect battery to b great.coming to some noticeable disadvantages os the battery is not removable which makes it a problem to have a visit to service center if some problem occurs os the battery back of d phone on standby is great up in that but then if u use it for hardware gaming with wifi/mobile data continuous usage u wont b happy then os him a average user - os usage stats are mostly - iii on whole time for what pp instagram, facebook & decent gaming - his usage provides me around 10-11 hours of battery back with screen on-time usage of around 4 his min or 5 hours which is no doubt great thing when u use net dont expect battery to b great.coming to some noticeable disadvantages os the battery is not removable which makes it a problem to have a visit to service center if some problem occurs os the battery back of d phone on standby is great up in that but then if u use it for hardware gaming with wifi/mobile data continuous usage u wont b happy then os him a average user - os usage stats are mostly - iii on whole time for what pp instagram, facebook & decent gaming - his usage provides me around 10-11 hours of battery back with screen on-time usage of around 4 his min or 5 hours which is no doubt great thing when u use net dont expect battery to b great.coming to some noticeable disadvantages os the battery is not removable which makes it a problem to have a visit to service center if some problem occurs os the battery back of d phone on standby is great up in that but then if u use it for hardware gaming with wifi/mobile data continuous usage u wont b happy then os him a average user - os usage stats are mostly - iii on whole time for what pp instagram, facebook & decent gaming - his usage provides me around 10-11 hours of battery back with screen on-time usage of around 4 his min or 5 hours which is no doubt great thing when u use net dont expect battery to b great.
couldn't keep up with the tracker's speed os i am using this product since yesterday i received and i charged my mobile yesterday in the evening still 62% battery is there.now i can say that the battery back is excellent.even the charger is not heating while charging.
wont buy this phone the list of problems is endless but the main ones will be 1 really awful touch you will get frustrated using it 2 battery doesn charge quickly but drains faster 3 laws a lot to for for some higher end honest buying mid range phone is really a bad idea.
last processor great screen and superb battery backup.
battery most worst 0/10 10.
the best phone in this class display looks good battery gives full day support takes long time to change than other honest.
the screen size has been increased and it does consumed the battery a bit more.without doing anything extra and lowest level of brightness playing no games(strictly), gas settings switched off always battery back up is mere 1.5days.think if you have much more apes and games it will drain down the battery within less than half a day.you can watch few video in couture and check the battery level.build 4/5 same 3.5/5 performance 3/5 even though lagging issues are there battery backup: 2.5/5 should have been increased to least 2500 may from 2070) round 4/5 display 3.5/5 all quality 3.5/5 ui response 3/5 nb: i am not comparing this handset(except moto g st men with any other company made handset.
was a good battery life.
its take 3:30+ hours to get 100% charged and battery drains out very fast.
battery is not good when compared with the features of the phone.there.are many features offering new technology but the battery doesn stands more than 12 of normal usage and 5 hours of hard usage.please.change the battery to 3000 ah.
nice & excellent phone in all means but battery goes down quickly when we working on apps,buying smart phone is to use the apply manufacturers must should have this in their mind other than this its a excellent phone!!!!!!!!!!.
battery wise.
usual front facing sterno speakers with amazing sound high capacity battery (approx.
only remark is its battery is not satisfactory when i say satisfactory it is up to me some of my friends say this is good.
i have been using a foka 5800 for many years and then i had tried the bony peri in for some time and i didn like it(very low battery performance and too buggy android).looks like that good too accidently put the phone in my pocket with my car keys and not a single went or scratch os the battery appears to last as motorola claims unlike what i heard with the first generation moto-gs.
only concern is battery which does not last much if the internet is on.battery back is also good at this range(better from asks zenfone 5 go n 16gb os.
battery back is also satisfactory its having one draw back that while playing games mobile get heated and it is very dangerous.
moto g 2 gen is an some phone i m impressed with all of its features in such less pocket.i concern battery as a issue which is not actually bad but do not level up with all of its other features.blindly add it to your cart n buy it.gr8 expirence!!!!!!.
heating issues yeah too much of os arms the phone up a bit but i have seen the same on almost every other model i have had a chance to lay my hands on.
battery back could have been unto 2500mah but still it works for a day with moderate use.
cons: to far the only issue i have faced is the battery back up.
using phone from last 20 days phone is actually too good and having very good touch music and camera quality is also awesome overall this mobile is best in less then 15000 budget battery is have some less back up due to 2070 may but overall is good mobile .
heating issues during call and all application installed via goose play gets corrupted and photos stored in os card gets delete automatically replaced the product 1 times and finally returned the product to flipkart.
- i have the battery save on and i dont use bluetooth, so him getting almost 2 days of use out of it between 2 his usage every day between phone book reader music and will bit of browsing.
battery drain too fast it does not last even for a half day when in use and it take too much time to charge.
battery back very less.it eats battery without using the phone also.
the phone is great for 10~13k no phone lag great ram & memory no issue with battery 1.5 day with normal use with g network display is clear and big enough for games & moves only disappointed with the camera quality though it is 8mp the clarity in not there.
battery life good display fabulous and performance mind-blowing.
overall the phone is good for moderate gazing display also good battery life is decent but if you use wife gathering then you are going to face conductivity issues.
poor battery backup.
good screen display but has very poor battery life.
the phone is amazing right from the presence in your hands great touch quality no heating up issues as i read at many places , amazing brightness and display good rear camera with good forgetting option .
please dont buy moto g2.i'm using malo go since 3week,it is heating like a often rock while playing games and using internet,both screen and back.flipkart didn take any action about my return request.
battery : it could be better but still in mix usage like turn off sync,3g data location while u r not using giving back more than 1 day ice 1.6d, on ideal state it drains very less.
battery back is the main problem with this phone if you didn charge your phone to full capacity before leaving for officer then you are in trouble.full battery hardly lasts for 16hrs,(with to data usage that may be because of conductivity issues.battery back is the main problem with this phone if you didn charge your phone to full capacity before leaving for officer then you are in trouble.full battery hardly lasts for 16hrs,(with to data usage that may be because of conductivity issues.i noticed battery performance is good on wife than on 3g.
there are serious battery issues the phone heat up.
motorola has not provided a standby phone also despite repeated requests to do so.
good cam good front cam good speakers average charger good battery perfect display size below average display good voice quality dual him expandable external memory good in build memory android 4.4.4.
very poor battery life even for my limited net usage and video-streaming etc 2.met result is i have to download battery monster and power bolster and keep running them every 1 hour or so.
camera is good,front camera is not unto that mark,good signal strength,3g working faster and battery is 2070mah which is little disadvantage but for this price it was good if compare other specification.
battery drains out quickly and comprise of only 851 os ram, i was disappointed with the approximate 1 os ram.us zenfone is far better than moto g and men in all aspects like camera ram, standby battery and runs smoothly than moto g and men.us zenfone is far better than moto g and men in all aspects like camera ram, standby battery and runs smoothly than moto g and men.
if going to buy also back come it was nearly rs800 which is expensive and battery also not so good cam it is ok not sound not good for ask mobile and head set also.
west stock andros phone under os 15000 camera in daylight vice grip and easy to hold cons: battery back is way too bad compared to moto g st gen camera in night or low light.
battery life is just normal nothing special.there are some drawback , as is to be expected from a budget phone.the battery is non removable so that could be a problem for some people.
i cannot understand why most reviews talk about potential battery life issues just because of the bigger screen.connectivity is fantastic.leave everything on and it fearlessly switches between if and 3g, and bluetooth goes into a low power standby state when not connected to a haired device.
highlight is certainly the battery.
battery life is decent with the 2700mah battery.battery life is decent with the 2700mah battery.
one more worst thing is battery is connected to the phone and can be removed separately.
battery life of moto g gen 1 and 2), which was one of the major requirement of smart phone is great and last for a day and half when charged fully.
battery back is just oka didn't last a day for me had to charge in the evening again.
pro good battery life , supports org first in line for updated sons lower display compared to moto g 1 , becomes a little slow when a lot of apes are open.
battery quality too poor discharging very fast and also it takes 4 his to charge with the motorolla charger same ringtone for both the him in a dual him cell unbelievable other functions are also too complicated mile manager voice recorder not preinstalled camera quality is very good overall an average mobile phone not up to the expectations from a company like motorolls.
the battery gets discharged os a days time despite os being very little use.
but after 6 month later i start facing heating problem and touch problem while charging phone.
avg: battery in oka.
camera and internet breakers have to carry the usb charger all the way wherever you go battery dies all the time and runs out of power.maximum of goose applications like google , hangoutgmail pp etc are consuming more battery , wherein , we cannot install those pp as well which is a sad part again.
poor battery life.
i have searched for many mobile which are so reliable in all terms their is only one mobile moto g gen very good product this time it has better battery life than the st gen.
sons : i noticed heating problem after 15-20 minutes usage.
really a nice phone to hang out with the only problems comes is of heating while playing games or surging.
i would have preferred them to offer the 16 os variant at this price as the processor seems to be a bit slow for the price.the battery life is decent and would last a day with minimum calls (~3-4 his talktime) and games played quite frequently.
its been around some three months i have been using the phone the major sons are the battery back which is not so good(2070 mah)it drains real fast and the phone seems to hang at times also the calls receiving isn good loud enough that the person sitting nearby you can hear the person on the other end of the phone although the hands free option isn selected i find the motor quite stylish though and the camera resolution gives really good images.
another bonus is that the android experience is native google android with no bloat-ware, with an upgrade when the next version becomes available.update 9-30-2014:after over a week of use discovered battery life is only sons os screen uses a lot of juice.to extend battery life screen must be dimmed and running apes stopped otherwise by end-of-day, battery will need to be charged.to extend battery life screen must be dimmed and running apes stopped otherwise by end-of-day, battery will need to be charged.

battery back is good enough to serve you more than 24hrs of fixed usage.

i have received moto go its battery back is worst and service by flipkart is also worst.
this product is a really genuine features phone the only problem is its battery life.the replacement model was too good but for a use from about a week or so i am realizing that with only light gaming and streaming the battery drains down to 15%!!!!.
heating is somewhat a problem of this phone , if u will play game for 1 he continuously it gets heated.
the battery back is low and not great as previous moto g 3 .
overall i am impressed its a good budget phone no last opening new windows is comfortable battery life is up to the mark camera is average.
i had an issue with my moto g in men within 10 days of purchase because of battery issue.
though heating may be issue in general it depends on the individuals usage.
maybe with the size increase of the screen ( vs st men moto g), motorola should have introduced a bigger battery but in general terms this is a great acquisition.
the sons of this phone are the non removable battery also the charge easily drains up in 1 day for moderate use and not quite impressive speed in surging the web compared to other smartphones.
perfect size good battery life.
ought 2 for my younger shillings by brother complained that within few days of the purchase the battery abruptly showed hero charge then went up to 80% abruptly once plugged in.
battery should have been least 2500 mah.
- camera is great - includes many goose built apes - 1 go ram is sufficient if you are not a terrific game - light weight - battery back is sufficient sons - takes unto 2-3 his to get fully charged - battery gets drained faster is data is on - gets i little bit of hot if used continuously for a long time overall i would like to say that moto g and gen is a good mobile in the prices if your budget is that much.- camera is great - includes many goose built apes - 1 go ram is sufficient if you are not a terrific game - light weight - battery back is sufficient sons - takes unto 2-3 his to get fully charged - battery gets drained faster is data is on - gets i little bit of hot if used continuously for a long time overall i would like to say that moto g and gen is a good mobile in the prices if your budget is that much.
processor ram and battery decent enough to perform best with current kitkat 4.4.4.build in battery enough for a day.battery only 2070 mah.
i expected a smart phone with a larger capacity battery than my former shone 4 to give me much better time between charges but have to charge every other day with minimum use during the period.
when i switch os mobile data when i open camera ( if i take 20photos it will be hanged when i open videos, battery is also not good.discharging like anything i am femur of moto g 2.
battery power is little bit bad.
when you keep the iii and os off the battery is pretty good.cried charging 100% yesterday night and kept it aside with iii conductivity on for a good 8 hours the battery went down to 65%.
its one of the finest product to purchase,battery life is very good,it never hangs like samson make mobile.it is the best mobile to purchase.
everything is nice except the non removable battery and i feel little thicker.
only drawback is battery is getting drained very fast.
the build quality is nice light in weight and good internal memory nice battery back with decent camera quality and no laws while playing games.
awesome, great phone fast looks great great battery quality it last longer than expected.
battery is draining very fast.
compared to other honest battery back up is not good.when phone is on idle mode the battery is discharging like anything.
it is a good purchase and it has good battery life which lasts unto one day with gaming etc a wonderful 8 up camera with flash.supports games.works fast.
good mobile with good performance but battery is not enough for a phone with 5 inch screen day charge is really mandatory for this mobile other than this its awesome.battery is not that great if you are using wife but should be okay for an average user.
worst battery back i have ever seen.battery discharged very fast and can sustained for even 6 hours.
in the phone is actually a bang for luck for has its own gros and sons despite of all rose it has a very less battery backup, does even stay for a day and also phone hangs occasionally.

battery back awesome.at least 24 hours with 4 hours g usage in variable network.
but battery back up is not so good(am a heavy user.
very good experience only one problem is that it takes so much time to charge the battery and the charger is very chip.battery back is average.
battery drains out very fast lasted for about the 20 min for extensive usage including wife gaming and talking 3.
in the negative side this phone could have more battery back just 2030 may for os screen.
battery life is longer than moto go.

it has plenty of good features but battery power only about 2100mah is quiet less when working on os connections , also front camera disappoint me it has to be least 5mp at this range where other good mobile in this range provide this .

must one thing this phone lacks is good battery backup.
awesome camera battery life.
very average performance for the kind of hardware on board battery is average as well,5-8 hours on continuous usage is very less.
the battery of the phone is biggest disappointing factor and takes 4 long hours to charge which will put my previous phone to shame and drains fast as well with a normal uses moto does need to work hard on a faster charging battery.cant degraded to kitkat as motorola teach support said.
gros os the phone is slim and easy to carry the phone has a good battery backup.
within a couple of days it developed a new problems the screen started heating up.

the only problem is the battery charging time.takes a lot of time.

just the battery isn enough.everything else is good but the battery life.
him not satisfied with the quality of this phone.on the first day itself the battery got dried up and it took 5 hours to get fully charged.my and problem was with the power off button when we click to the power off/on button it gets tilted to one side think in today comparative world if moto is asking ask phone than it should have least 1.5gb ram and 13 os primary camera and 5 os secondary.worst battery of the mobile.i have seen in my life.hence not recommended to anyone.i never expected that flipkart will cheat me like this being the old and esteemed customer of flipkart.
i think it should operate at 2 os ram with a battery charger with a usb port cable and may be a good phone then.
battery is good.android is 4.4.4.
door battery head phone is not worth for it.
battery can be bigger.
mobile heating problem.very.
i find this phone great in every function be it battery performance display or anything.
battery drain very fast.very bad experience with my new phone and flipkart electric shock from the speaker metal while charging with my lawton us battery training so fast phone getting heated up quickly.
since its shares the same configuration as the same old moto-g st men phone except for the bigger display battery back goes for a toss here.
worst battery back and camera clarity.two much time taken to battery charge.
good for mid range buying battery back is good.
after 2 months excessive battery drainage happened.(100% battery loss in just 2 minutes when i contracted local service center they told me to submit phone for 15 days.even after 25 days they said the battery has not come.when i asked for status it was touch-pad and battery replacement.
ideally unbeatable.no battery problem.corning gorilla glass with os display.plays every format.
door battery barely sustaining a day with regular use 3.shone heating up while charging and even while using os data 5.
the battery life on this phone isn terrible.i will use it more and make sure how good is the battery.but 2070 may battery for a os phone is very frugal.performance.but the same battery so longer battery life.but the same battery so longer battery life.
screen brightness and viewing angles are good it has a super bright flash.the biggest let down to me is the battery life i can get max 7-9 hours of use out of the phone before him running for a charge.with the lack of memory and longer battery life i only gave it a 4/5.
yesterday i have got this phone and the phone was just awesome the camera battery mainly screen awesome.
heating would sometimes be completely impossible making the phone pretty unusable.so,.
gros premium look -5" os display dual speakers are loud n clear -8mp camera takes amazing pictures when hdr mode is on os day battery back on g network - fast started and shutdown - to lag - smooth user interface voice grip and easy to hold bones - earphone quality is not good - only him 1 slot support os network.
the battery lasts a long time.
must 1 complaint that i have is its battery back could have been better.antutu shows very bad chart for devices stability note:- i checked the temperature using cputemp, clean master and antutu.
amazing and at a wonderful prices it is a layman nexus just the best features easy to handle fits right in your hand 1 problem: battery drains too fast wont last even a day with net on.
i was only worried about the battery life which turned out to be good.
i even saw its performance when it was with them and battery back was also fine.when using internet or searching map by using internet it heat like hell & battery drain my god .battery comes down to 55% from hundred for just one hour of whatsapp and facebook.i installed some high performance games can play because either the device gets heated or a battery gets drained.
good product from motorola but moto g 2 should have made some changes in battery strength for its specification.
i was totally satisfied with this phone and strongly recommending this to other.best quality phone with best battery back.
to words to say.its absolutely fantastic in every aspects.no other phone in this price level can perform better than this.the screen is large enough.touch is fantastic.speed is great.no heating while playing heavy games.this phone supports many games and applications that some smart phone pricking above 25k(arjuns phone per the canst support.
charging time : 5 hours poor battery backup.
heating problem in this phone.
the only drawback is that the battery is poor.even though 2070mah sounds pretty cool and fancy but the battery hardly lasts 12 hours.even without playing any games and with battery save on him having to charge the device around twice a day.
battery is ok.but it needs improvement (backup wise usb cable should be provided.other wise we have to depend on other sources again which is not good for your products.
but battery seems to last less because of bigger screen.
great phone at this price range u can get something be cons: average processor if u use goose now with cards and ok goose voice command it laws a bit battery it cut get u through a day if u use battery save apes build it actually feels good except for the buttons they wobbly and feel cheap the speaker trills have some gap dust gets into it accessories earphones are just happy it wont even sit in or ears pros: call quality nothing much to say but its clear camera ism actually surprised by this camera but it sucks totally in lowliest vanilla android!!!.great phone at this price range u can get something be cons: average processor if u use goose now with cards and ok goose voice command it laws a bit battery it cut get u through a day if u use battery save apes build it actually feels good except for the buttons they wobbly and feel cheap the speaker trills have some gap dust gets into it accessories earphones are just happy it wont even sit in or ears pros: call quality nothing much to say but its clear camera ism actually surprised by this camera but it sucks totally in lowliest vanilla android!!!.
i bought moto os three months ago and it starts heating up while keep it on for charging.

product is good initially their is problem of battery back but thanks to motorola customer care and flipkart to resolve this issue.this is due to lack of synchronisation between software and battery hardware.

next day 13-feb-2015 updated all apes through if and charged from pm to 6 pm until battery got 100% and didn used phone after 6 pm.and just guess that should be battery percentage now?.to over a night a phone consume 15% of battery even if no one use it.the battery in this phone is a freak.by face would be burnt off with such a defective phone , i placed a return request to flipkart.they called 4 days late and gave stupid reasons like , please close any unwanted apes in your device which consume battery but the phone is still in factory rest condition with no apes installed.the executive is asking me to mentally go to settings and force close each pp when in not using .i am an andros developer and know much more than u flipkart executive regarding application battery usage and background services.
first piece had major problem with battery it needed to charge 2-3 times a day also it used to hang a lot.door battery drains faster 2.
rose design and build quality battery is not that bad compared to zenfone5 display is good.
i am using this phone about 2-3 months.it is really amazing and battery performance is also good and picture and video clarity is superb.specially.
premium good performance excellent battery life.
were are the reasons i did face an issue with battery to requested a replacement.the battery drains like anything.the battery draining very fast and has to be charged every few hours even if the phone is not in use and all applications are closed.the os itself is drawing heavily from battery.
otherwise good there issues with the battery.the piece i got might be defeated because the battery charges quickly and then it drains completely in 5 minutes.
it turned extremely bad for me battery is not lasting for even 4 his when it is just kept idle[no talks,no data on no wife usage].
the phone is really pathetic the performance is excellent doesn last but what about battery,.it takes 5.30hrs for the battery to get completely charged and phone gets hot like anything even the phone is not on charging it gets hot and battery drains damn fast it doesn even last for 15hrs.it takes 5.30hrs for the battery to get completely charged and phone gets hot like anything even the phone is not on charging it gets hot and battery drains damn fast it doesn even last for 15hrs.cut a star because of the average camera(by today smartphone standard and not so great battery life.
battery is a letdown but still it lasts enough for say 1 day in moderate use.
are no heating problem.there are no speaker problem.the.there is 1 day battery life.very.surely the value for money just battery a bit not powerful but it doesn matter.
its the battery.i would say battery for such a good phone should be minimum of 2500mah and more than that.if you want a long battery life then you have to go for a power bank.
i got the phone two weeks back and in the first week i had battery problems then i am facing tat i cannot answer my calls when the screen is unlocked.
except the below issue : ( os poor battery.battery does not last even 5 hours when g is on.(random usage most shocking : to data cable in the box os os charger provided in box is a non - usb plug os type charge which charges the battery at a dead slow rate of 20% for 1 hour os.
now battery life after upbraiding to lollipop.
no heating problem as well.
vice experience other than camera performance video recording is good battery performance is average.
for those guns who are confused between this and us zenfone os * to for moto g men os though the camera is not as great as asks but the lifetime battery of the phone is great and this can save your life in difficult situations experience with flipkart return / service * badly the phone i received was faulty ( the second him card slot was not sanctioning properly and the power button was faulty ) * i called up on the flipkart toll free number and spoke to the csr, she was really helpful and placed a replacement request.
battery drains out before night if you play games for a long time.
but the battery life could be better.
yeah we can say that the battery sucks .

os all know that its a good product but only the problem is battery 2000mah.
door battery performance , but flipkart rejected the request for refund.i got the replacement earlier and experienced the battery issue again.wish you good luck os =========================================================== battery issue within 3 days of use ( first review all other reviews suggest this phone is good.sar value can be of concern but for me the battery has caused problems.must bought the phone last week and its not been a week since use the battery begins to drain at faster pace.the battery indication shows 100% on full charge in morning 70 % post 3 hours with the phone used just for calls .when the phone is kept completely idle with no application running no 3g-wi-fi, gps os etc the battery still drains at the rate of os every 1-2 minutes.this is really puzzling and on direct communication with motorola assist team they say to do cache-wipe and factory rest to see if battery is resolved.honestly the phone looks good but battery is really a turn-off.
only problem is of its battery.whenever my mobile is on standby battery remains steady as soon as i start using it battery drains very rapidly.specially when i start using camera and whatsapp.for clinking 4-5 photos by camera battery drains 4-6%.only problem is of its battery.whenever my mobile is on standby battery remains steady as soon as i start using it battery drains very rapidly.specially when i start using camera and whatsapp.for clinking 4-5 photos by camera battery drains 4-6%.only problem is of its battery.whenever my mobile is on standby battery remains steady as soon as i start using it battery drains very rapidly.specially when i start using camera and whatsapp.for clinking 4-5 photos by camera battery drains 4-6%.only problem is of its battery.whenever my mobile is on standby battery remains steady as soon as i start using it battery drains very rapidly.specially when i start using camera and whatsapp.for clinking 4-5 photos by camera battery drains 4-6%.same for whatsapp, for 5 mind chatting battery drains 5-6%.moto u should give good battery backup.expecting some improvement from u for our mobile.
the battery back up lasts for a day with os or wife connected all day and some apes like whatsapp, facebook, instagram and news updated working in the background with location service also switched on at all times.
you should be aware that you cannot take out the battery - its internal.
however, the battery wouldn charge after the upgrade.
battery life battery life is subjective and depends from person to person.battery life battery life is subjective and depends from person to person.the new moto g has the same battery as that of its predecessor.a non user replaceable 2070 may battery.am a bit surprised that they haven bumped up the battery in proportion to the screen size.but nevertheless in able to squeeze out 7-8 hours of battery on an average with about 2-2.5 his of screen on time.
to heating issues best screen.
battery drain is very fast.
had some battery back issues but got resolved with the lollipop updated.
no problems with the battery,multitasking.display is awesome.easy to use with one hand.
vice performance and battery backup.
battery life of phone is very average that was a big disappointment sometime slow up .

only i want to include that battery time is less as expected when wife or data connection is kept on.
you can go wrong when you buy a motorola smartphone, battery last all day updated are fast and easy to installs and build quality is great for the prices this phone could be for someone buying a smartphone for the first time or may for a back phone.
battery back is pretty good with average calls gaming and net surging.i did experience some heating while playing kinship battle around the camera lens.
well it is over heating compared to my friends and i asked for exchange within days but flipkart told me to take to the motorola service center though it is an accessory.battery drains quickly even if location and son is turned off.battery lasts only a day.the battery it take a long time to charge and the charger gets heated up so much as if its going to burst 2.
i bought two motor os mobile for my friends os good phone go for it but battery drains very fast.
battery should have been increased because of the improved speck and bigger screen.
, call quality is good battery is about a day and using pure andros is how every phone should be.motorola did a nice job on this and a phone all be keeping for a long timely wife actually wants to get rid of her s for one of these that how surprising this phone is.
the battery provided with the phone is not working properly and requires charging within usage of some minutes.
the battery performance is way below expectations it can hardly take 6 hours of daily business operations on both sim cards being active.
the phone is excellent in all function say its call quality no lag in gaming with quand core processor best camera in range of 13,000 os loud dual speakers best user interface pretty and latest andros experience like weight better screen etc in case of battery life all the andros phone get heated in multitasking and less battery life but this phone is best i had used canvas nitric axiom red os and canvas eliza all three can be used for droning when they get heated also the ui of red os is worst no task button found on it whereas canvas eliza and into was good but they doesn have gorilla glass protection.the phone is excellent in all function say its call quality no lag in gaming with quand core processor best camera in range of 13,000 os loud dual speakers best user interface pretty and latest andros experience like weight better screen etc in case of battery life all the andros phone get heated in multitasking and less battery life but this phone is best i had used canvas nitric axiom red os and canvas eliza all three can be used for droning when they get heated also the ui of red os is worst no task button found on it whereas canvas eliza and into was good but they doesn have gorilla glass protection.

about battery i have got decent battery juice without charging much.about battery i have got decent battery juice without charging much.again advance part of battery in next post.
motorola has increased the screen size,and little on battery from 1900 t 2070 may 3.motorola has not increased the battery strength.a meagre 2070 may is not sufficient to run phone entire day , if you plan to use dual him internet on phone couple of prints from phone directly,whats pp the battery sadly lasts half a day only even when i have not listened to any music or clicked any picture.any 5 inch phone should have at least 2600 may battery or no point in buying a phone unless you are okay to charge your phone twice a day.it is here where motorola loose out big time for not giving comparable battery for a 5 inch phone.overall a great buy for dual him functionality , great looks and functionality at budget but big let down on battery.
all these feature in the moto g are very good but problem is that battery back is still not so much.
the 2070 may battery perform very well and gives you a days use with moderate to heavy use.
good holds the battery good screen good sound.
first device was facing heating issue which got replaced one within a one day.ui - west morning gorilla glass - you would not prefer using any other device without cgg android updated - instant received with built lollypop in replaced cell battery - with normal apes like whatsapp, gaily ff with wife connection can easily go for one day music - i am not fan but i guess it is pretty good camera - awwsome clarity.
the battery back up is bit low compared to my lumia-720 , but the touch screen and fluidity for usage is excellent.
battery may be an issue if you are continuously on games.though after initial first few overnight charge cycle the battery run longer.
every thing os fine ,,, but battery oh god !!!., i wont use it much os but still its battery is getting down tooooooooooo fast .
battery goes only for one day.
looking wise good phone but battery back up not good only 8 to 10 hour on os net.
i wish the battery life was a little longer but no matter how long it was and wish it was longer.
the only problem is of battery.battery drain very fast.
i buried my moto go it was heated up like anything and even the battery drained very quickly.but even in the new replaced moto go the problem is the same once again getting heated up once again battery is draining really fast in really disappointed on these two issues from the cell phone.

i think the main issue everyone is concerned about is the battery life.well i can safely say that this phone has brilliant battery life.there is also a default battery save option in settings.i read some reviews which described the battery life as poor hence i was skeptically before i could purchase this.
well mobile seems to be very good but battery life is pathetic for battery charging it takes 4-5 hours and once it is charges it comes to os within 4-5 hours without using internet services.well mobile seems to be very good but battery life is pathetic for battery charging it takes 4-5 hours and once it is charges it comes to os within 4-5 hours without using internet services.i am so disappointed with battery as i had given this mobile to my dad as a gift.
coming to battery and charging using samson and other charges the part near camera heat like hellll.the battery percentage does not fall uniformly.but in next 15 minutes of standby it went to 54.

nice phone with very good features battery back is very nice since this is my first smart phone i am enjoying it sound quality is also good the only thing that troubles me is that it does not has an built file manager so you have to download an pp called es file explorer in the playstore you can not set your own custom ring tone so i did it using the smile explorer and there is no reminder feature in it or note pad facility and you can even keep different lock screen and different home screen pictures i faced only these problems all games work nice and all apes also work properly nice phone within its price happy to own a moto os.
i dont care about whatever negative things people have to sat about this superb phone.am using it for the last three day,battery charge at the end of the day is at about 60%.
its got a poor battery life.this is probably my worst buy on flipkart!!!.
his i have got this phone last week and found built quality is simply good light weight but after using for 5 days and found the battery is draining very fast even in stand bye mode and its heating up after and down loads which i had not expected from this product i have asked for a replacement today and they say they will call by today evening hope to get a new replacement other wise great product and as usual lip part delivery was on time.his i have got this phone last week and found built quality is simply good light weight but after using for 5 days and found the battery is draining very fast even in stand bye mode and its heating up after and down loads which i had not expected from this product i have asked for a replacement today and they say they will call by today evening hope to get a new replacement other wise great product and as usual lip part delivery was on time.

but only battery back is low.
go senior to support motion games and took wise is awesome,real sterno speaker the only problem i m facing is battery backup.battery back is really not good.
only complaint that i have is that the battery door is super hard to open and it took me a while to insert my him cards.but that is not a big deal at all and perhaps this is an advantage because the battery door is not easy to open so that it would not break open even if the phone is accidentally dropped.
performance of battery when compared to mediate mobile of same segment is better.to heating issues.
camera quality battery back is excellent compare to asks zenfone os also we have wife hotspot which we dont have in asks.but battery drain gradually which we have to manage in all smartphone today.

him far from a power user so the battery easily lasts about 2-3 days every time i charge it.
sons with the new 5.0 updated it laws a bit but i guess will soon be okay with bug fixes battery life is just okay and have dropped my phone 5-6 times but some news say its screen is weak nd breaks on falling.so, i guess u shed use back cover but some of my friends are using it without cover so its or decision.
when i download and played a high graphics game it was awesome but it lasted for only 7 minutes after which the phone automatically switched off due to zero battery.

average battery life.
i bought a new moto go using pp offer got the phone within two days with lot of issues which unable to solved first thing i vexed with the shone battery got heated while using the phone internet or watching any video second worst case about the mobile is hearing person they hear their own voice(echo) while speaking in very loudly simply saying door quality.
battery is an issue here otherwise is a worth to go for.
fantastic handset os mid range, best battery back up, flexibility os move apps os os card, best features, excellent speed.
coming to the battery life him pretty much happy a whole day back which i liked on it with an average usage putting it in wife and texts surging n etc am happy with the performance.the all quality the display battery round camera the had more processor hats what you expect from a phone at this price range.
with in @ week am facing problem like stuck heating.
and mobile is working is very slow automatically battery going to os.
i bought this phone 3 months back.from 1 month it started making problems.low battery back is inherent drawback.and then volume and power buttons started making problems.mow volume down button is gone.worst thing is motorola service .
first i got a mobile at a bad condition but i replaced it and really its awesome, everything works fine the touch the battery the performance and even i got the update 5.0.2 on the same day after installing email act to my mobile.
battery is oka will last 10 to 12 hours.
i i have taken this shone and the battery back up is very poor only 4 hours without using it for talking on stand by or using net it gives u only 4 hours of back up.well battery and heating problem with the phone.well battery and heating problem with the phone.
good battery life.
i am using moto g 2 since 13thfeb2015 birthday i am happy by this smart phone its screen quality camera quality sound everything is best and enjoying lollipop but its battery disappoints me otherwise best phone in my hand.
shone is overall good only two disadvantages according to me are its battery is pathetic and the display is too delicate.
degraded with lolipop u find problem in battery phone show 100% battery full time but suddenly phone get shut down.degraded with lolipop u find problem in battery phone show 100% battery full time but suddenly phone get shut down.
battery is just okay.
battery is fine not as bad as criticized like assist which comes with the phone it sets up my usage pattern easily and i dont have to configure usage pattern manually.although glad that i can be free of samsung's bloated apply i do not like that android 4.4 doesn provide enabling wifi/bluetooh/airplane mode in single wipe and tick maybe him just unaware how to do it.
have been using it for 3 days only but here is my initial observation on the only con i saw so far battery.the of watching video on if ate up 30% of the battery.there was also little heating up of the hands but that is kind of excepted from all smartphones.
battery drain is too much on standby.battery drain is too much on standby.i slept at 11 pm battery was 48% when i woke up at 6.30 am it was 32%(wifi and net was off.
the missing star is for the battery.motorola should have adjusted the battery rating for bigger display.they retained the same battery from moto g (gen1).
os i mentioned in my review title this phone heat clot , has a buzzing apiece problem while on a call and battery back is also not good at all.
-->moto released with pure stock andros up date version mitka 4.4.4 which feels like dipping your figure in water while operating it and for sure moto will update with android os --> battery(2070mh) performance is good if it is mixed use.
i got this product 1 week back everything of this phone is fine but its battery sucks.of i charged fully at 9 os at night in the morning i find 30% remaining of total battery of this phone(ideal condition).
battery slight con from this still good to get it !!!.
the guaranteed upgrade to lollipop was pushed out a while ago nicer screen better battery life that makes it even cooler!flawless with at&t, i dont care that its not full os lte, it does everything i need it to even watching affinity to on data works fine.one complaint and this has nothing to do with the phone hang still hasn released a screen protector for it.
about shone rose slim and bandy good image quality both front and back smooth touch screen good multitasking processing battery back-up is enough for whole day full activity use good sound system voice recognition system is excellent display resolution is os so its good enough.sons it keeps running out of battery very fast if continuously using gps for even 1hr, ear piece point only works for motorola ear piece tried with other ear piece but its not accepting except motorola), no us cable-charger portability.
---------------------pros *5" display front speakers are loud n clear no network or call drops *8mp camera takes amazing pictures when hdr mode is on micro os slot up to 32gb ----------------------con's and battery performance is average.
and after having updated to lollipop 5.0.2 the battery is draining like water.the battery doesn even last 6 hours.overall a good mobile phone but battery is very low.
must an foi for pp out there.latest lollipop update is a massive battery drained !!!.no changes at all as far as new apes installed or something but the battery drain if is substantially more !!!!.
i am a light user and the battery gives me a day and a half consistently.
battery lockup was too poor 4.heating when we use 1 he continuously when a placed a replacement request and i got a new shone again.battery backup.
the battery life is much better than most other phone available even with the larger screen than the original.the battery size doesn appear to be as influential as many would prefer to believe.with the arrival of the soon to come android updated there is suppose to be yet an even further increase in improving battery life.oh, and then there the addition of the microsd card slot.
and the battery for me parts one and a half days and best of all it has no problems.
battery : 2070 may used to power 4.5, same is used to power 5.0 , the path is simple here with not a good outcome.
screen touch is giving problems battery level suddenly drops from eg 70% to 5%.
no point to raise about anything except the essential battery.ahahah god os to those many features in hand the given 2070mah battery is not even close to the benchmarks.finally disappointed with battery but overall performance is quite good .
sound (speaker)- excellent sound(headphone)- average camera (primary)- very good camera(front)- excellent internet & apps- very good display and view- excellent video - excellent documents -very good battery - very good touch- good sensor - very excellent overall the motorola device is a complete smartphone surprisingly in just 12999/-.
by only complaints are the battery life and internal storage.
even the battery now doesn last for more than 4 hours since last charged.
lot of time to charge the battery may be because of charger issues.
his phone has a aerial network issue but if anyone can ignore this then it is a splendid phone as compare to any other phone display - 5/5 camera - 4.5/5 battery - 4/5 looks - 4/5 network - 2/5 update - 2.5/5 overall - 6/10.
about the battery.battery life is not very great but manageable.
this is the waste phone i have ever bought i just want to through this out of my home first of it started from camera it laws frames while shooting video then it started heating up after lollipop update entire phone became june now its touch stopped working.
today i received it in afternoon ordered a day before.superb delivery by os oats off.ordered day before took standard delivery and due date by saturday but received beforehand.unboxing it like superb experience product is new although i had doubt on os detail products since i read many negative reviews on it.but ultimately this product is good in this price range i was worried how it would be but it completely satisfy my mobile image and i used for 4-5 hours of now battery still running waiting to drain so that can charge it till now application working fine no lagging issue so far experience is good overall i say if they lower price till 11-12k it would be must buy.

the mobile os awesome all the features are amazing but please work on its battery it so so weak and fall down so fast.take mobile battery removable.
the only con about the products it uses the same battery as the old moto os considering the bigger screen size an upgrade would have made this perfect.
the battery life lasts almost 1 day with 2 sims, full-day if with 2 his of os usage and average of 15-20 calls per day.
only issue - battery!!!.overall i would say not at all bad for a 2070mah battery.

cam clarity is fine battery comes for a whole day with moderate usage.
good speed to hang up battery charging life moderate - may be because of my continuous data usage.
snatched telephone in this range revolution in motorola.very good battery back up good quality of display.
i bought this phone 10 days back and its rapid battery discharge has taken a toll now.i have just raised a return request.its battery only last for max 4 hours after charging it to 100 % .today when i got up its battery was just 15 % and when i plugged in for charging it suddenly charged up to 100% after using for an hour , the phone got shut.

have good camera quality,sound quality also good it has gorilla glass no need to protection like scratch guard,battery life is the area u will check it is decent but depends on u r usage.
it had 60% battery so it shouldn be it os also plugged it in and still no response.
from display to battery wife to mobile data every thing is perfect only regret is better quality headphones and absence of data cable from manufacturers.
battery drain too fast why.

good battery back and good sound quality.touch is nice but it distort when you touch it with wet hands.
i could not have asked for a better travel phone.ingress - this phone handled all the basic tasks well gps was spot on the entire time there was not perceived lag due to the g speed but the battery will only last about 4 hours so i would recommend an external battery pack if you are going to be at it for extended periods of time.i could not have asked for a better travel phone.ingress - this phone handled all the basic tasks well gps was spot on the entire time there was not perceived lag due to the g speed but the battery will only last about 4 hours so i would recommend an external battery pack if you are going to be at it for extended periods of time.

the mobile has power issues once the power is switched off it canst be switched on and the battery back up is too bad when i service my mobile from service center and now it is working fine.all features in this mobile are good battery back is too pathetic.
battery log doesn always show charging when i put it on charging.
purchased 2 moto g gen 2 phone 4 days back.initially i was very excited.but the main problem with(both my honest is that battery drains out very fast even if you use it moderately ice 1 day max with wife or os with the usage.of i use it only for wife then it takes 2.5 his to drain battery.another problem is the charger.it takes 3.5-4 his to charge the battery.once the battery is at 30-25% then need to charge it other wise it takes very long time to charge.other than the battery issue overall phone is nice.
only regret that the battery could have been better.
all the features are good but heating too much.
sons 1 the battery back is low and not great specially after lollipop upgrade 2.
only one drawback that battery should be more than 2070mah.

moto g i love it good battery life and good camera quality and worth of money and great shipping service and worth it.
very poor quality of battery getting hot very earlier calling sound quality not good.
battery back is awesome.
battery life has been superior.
but the only problem it has is the battery.the battery drains too fast.
him facing lot of problems with this product.it hangs,heats,battery problem.etc.the order made me regret and disappoint.
the battery is not as bad as some people say maybe for heavy users it s not reliable but for the regular texters, callers and os or other multimedia viewer the phone is perfect.
shone is awesome no performance drop in like 3 to 4 months but i must say battery back is shit shit shit!!!!!!.i had to lower the brightness at lowesttt.:( 4 stars for the bad battery backup.
generally happy with the phone but the battery sucks.
after all the thing i realized that the battery back should be more.
it is a best phone ever in this price range battery back is good camera quality is also good overall a best deal for this price.
os battery back not that good.
last battery drain.
this mobile phone got heated sense since i was bought and the battery i was charged 100% at morning 9 clock after 12:30pm it shows only 30% , the battery was fully drain and the phone was showing white screen , and i need to switch on my mobile but i dint switch on it takes 25 min os.this mobile phone got heated sense since i was bought and the battery i was charged 100% at morning 9 clock after 12:30pm it shows only 30% , the battery was fully drain and the phone was showing white screen , and i need to switch on my mobile but i dint switch on it takes 25 min os.
total fail this mobile battery performance very bad camera quality is not good signal strength very bad.
nice camera,excellent graphics,good looks,very smart,but low battery life in a nut shell the phone is brilliant package of amusement but for a short time.
all the features are good except the battery backup.
battery battery is pathetic.battery battery is pathetic.for the volume of the calls i candle the battery ends only half day and i have to continuously keep it for charging.very not shone is heating up like a hot oven if the call is carried for 5 minutes plus almost burning my ears.finally i am very dejected with the battery performance.for the kind of processor speed they have given a absolute useless battery.
awesome phone in its class,,though battery is a bit problem while playing games it goes down fast.but on normal usage it is very gud.so 5 stars.
more than average battery life.battery drops to 40% from full charge if used continuously for 4-5hours on data packet mode.but when you do not use it for getting or gaming purpose then battery back is too good you will hardly need to charge again on same day.
seems to be on the light-weight side for its size plastic backing non-removable battery os haven tested its longevity yet very slight muffled sound to calls.not a crystal clear sound but not an issue at all.
the moment i opened it it showed me update for andros os that was a bang on before andros l update phone battery was awesome but after its up-gradation it gets discharge very easily but the good point is also that it get charged very fast.over all phone performance from its ui, camera sound quality to features like moto assist and all attracts a lot but you have to compromise its battery life once it gets upgrade to andros os otherwise this phone is awesome , a big thumbs up os.
but its battery back is very poor if data is used it lasts only 5-6 his only .
only complain that i have is regarding the battery.had the battery been in range of 2500-3000mah, it would have been great.
recent battery life.
and about the battery of u r using wife then one full charge will give u around 22-24hrs wid some internet usage and songs and some games ( its solely depends upon the user and how he uses i dint use wife ) to 1 thing i didn ly was the charger and ear phone daisy i giving 4 star rating to moto g the charger becomes hot ly hell when we charge the phone for 1 he i m using nokia charger which works alright .
battery is again good for fair usage 5.
nice product as per specification battery is not up to expectation but average .
but one thing that was not fine in my last 5 months of usage was the battery.also the battery was draining lastly when we play online games ratio was like if you play 10 mind in online then 10 to 15 % charge will be lost.but if you not using internet the battery serves nicely for 2 days.
battery back i also not good.
it is giving upgrade for andros lollipop but i think its has hanging problem so i suggest that buy it become battery back is good and features are excellent so overall it is good phone.
, 8mp camera primary and 2mp in front really good sound quality thanks to the dual front speakers very good battery life expandable storage screen resolution is good.
dont buy i can play high end games but 6000 os micromax can play games what i expected shitttttttttttttttttttt battery problem.
all are good except battery and data cable.battery charges very slowly.takes.battery drains quickly even if you are not using internet.
battery backup.
gros os good camera quality os hardly any lag os value for price os expandable memory sons os biggest problem is battery issue since it is draining in 5-6 hours if we are using os continuously.they could have increase the battery ah.
altogether phone itself is a marvel in respect to camera battery sound speed performance.
i mean whenever u buy a phone if money is not a problem consider this phone os i appreciate its built qualtiy,speaker sound,battery back up and camera quality that os is awesome.it is more faster and battery performance is very good it is awesome moto os is lucky to me camera is good.if u want a simple andros phone then go for it.its built quality is the best.very unable .
battery : lasts only 12-14 hours with normal usage (whatsapp, games internet surging etc 3.
come to the point please do not buy after 2-3 days uses you can find os camera many times hanged and automatically it exit from application os touch screen is not working some for very short time os battery life is average but it takes very long time to charge os wi-fi connection automatically disconnected os during call you may feel stitches in voice os you may feel heating at backside during more than 10 min call os lots of other functions are also not working as per specification.come to the point please do not buy after 2-3 days uses you can find os camera many times hanged and automatically it exit from application os touch screen is not working some for very short time os battery life is average but it takes very long time to charge os wi-fi connection automatically disconnected os during call you may feel stitches in voice os you may feel heating at backside during more than 10 min call os lots of other functions are also not working as per specification.
vice battery backup.
i have to say the first night i used it it seemed like that i received a defective piece with poor earphone volume poor speaker volume and a really bad battery.however its been almost 10 days now and the battery is a powerhouse, i have to say.him getting a ~14-15 hours battery back on an all-time-3g, all-syncs-on, os hour web browsing and im.and it stays at a working temperature of 30-35 os the screen perform unexpectedly well in even very bright sunlight.os far as that goes him having almost the same experience as my previous lucia 720 which used to give me battery back of ~20-22 hours thought.
his phone has very bad battery & the phone overheard till 61 c !!!.
and the battery dries up easily twice a day have to recharge.
mobile was good feature good handling os is like it battery life is not good enough for m2, and how to set songs into ringtone ?.
the major issue is only the battery which is insufficient for this big screen mobile.
all directly come to pro and sons of this very good phone gros - * value for money * not much of heating issue unlike most of the andros phone * smooth interface * upgradeable to lollypop * almost native andros * dual him and good speakers * decent camera * feels sturdy sons - * pathetic display.
1)everything is fine except battery.
battery back up is fair enough good conductivity etc flipkart is smart as always in meeting the delivery timelines.
happen while playing clash of clan and it so struggle to return to the main menu but 1 thing i real love is battery life unto 1.7day.

however as has been rightly pointed out by many the battery life is pathetic.hence for that purpose i have been experimenting about various steps that one can take to ensure satisfactory battery backup.os saw this as a major contributory to battery life.and my battery life increased twofold.
* battery life.
good to buy for this price but the only draw back is build battery .
hardware is best looks are slim and stunning latest andros updated guaranteed no extra bloatwares, in built software are very useful and of fine qualities battery back is great camera is way too stunning front sterno speakers are the best in class and performance never hangs best optimization of memory and processor screen and touch are mind blowing you have the option of different colors replaceable back-covers original moto brandy that suits or style.
ought moto g and men from flipcart, and i made biggest mistake in my life battery life was hardly 3 hours and i had charge mobile 4 times in day.also cell was heating a lot that it can burn my skin i had to carry mobile in my bag rather than in my pocket.
i am not having any problems with the battery backup.when mobile data is kept on without restricting background data usage battery gets drained in about 20 his.
everything is ok but this phone has very poor battery backup.they have just raised the price by calling it moto g and men otherwise it doesn have any thing new and unique am strictly using this phone on battery saving mode and also i have ordered for a power bank after two days of the purchase.
for my usage battery lasts one full day even after extreme usage.
love the touch camera is just as as and as cons:less network conductivity average battery life.
battery is great.
i had earlier bought a moto g for 11,999 which had two major manufacturing defects (1) sound quality when speaking to anyone including flipkart; and (2) battery began to show bulges within a week of delivery.after heating for a month whether to or not to i made up my mind added 1,000 to the kitty and ordered for moto g and men for 12,999 say 13,000 those 999s are deceptive his time as i opened the back cover to put in sim cards i noticed the battery isn any more visible.after heating for a month whether to or not to i made up my mind added 1,000 to the kitty and ordered for moto g and men for 12,999 say 13,000 those 999s are deceptive his time as i opened the back cover to put in sim cards i noticed the battery isn any more visible.result user canst keep a watch if the battery is drying up too soon to be acceptable.

charger when you touch the end of charger for connecting the phone you will find in a curved surface indicating the bigger and smaller ending need for inspecting the end before application if you use to it cost battery is not as expected as i was using lot of apply.

battery dies within 12 hour to hero percent.i have kept my location os and only much needed application are running no game installed even if i talk for 15 mind battery dies within 5 to hours.
shone heat up very fast very difficult to talk for long time his any one can u pus tell me how to increase the battery back.
i brought this phone 1 month before and it have him card shots problems network conductivity problems hanging problem and also battery problems.
shone is good but battery back is too low need to upgrade with new power back .
to lag in any kind of application or games os os or g both runs fast sons well not really for me but a bit of battery issue for those who are very army or social media suffer.
at the same time door battery backup.charging 8 to 10 his only withstand.without any browsing all making., must like a standby time.while rose or all making battery lockup is very poor.
i bought new moto g mobile and it has defeated battery when i raised request to flipkart they said that seller rejected the request.

battery sucks if you use internet continuously it will drain in 5 hours .battery is big drawback in this phone .the person who is looking for good battery back up this phone is not for them .battery takes 3.5 hours to get charge fully , it sounds like i am charging phone more than i am using it .
i bought this phone and its battery is very disappointing for me.with out a good battery .
if using os battery is draining fast only problem i found is voice call recording is not supported.
best budget phone better than any other bands at this prices smart assistance google apes are now solid built in quality android is up-gradable, camera is decent heating problems headset is worst.
pro os card sloth good camera & flash clear speakers avail os updated etc on battery life average bad charging cable had to buy samsung charge to avoid heat issue i dont use the moto charge.
- non-removable battery - 1 os ram ( moto could have increased it to least 1.5 gb) but it does affect the performance.- battery back not so impressive.it gives average battery life.but the android l os is expected to increase the battery backup, so keep your fingers crossed - os radio not payable through the speakers i have seen many users complaint that the os radio cannot be played on the loud speakers.
not this mobile on with apr'15, but battery back is very poor.
good battery backup, super fast speed.
everything is awesome except the battery .also the battery will drain out in 6 to 7 hours if you use internet.
however the second piece that has been supplied is hopeless as the battery drains out in no time even when the mobile is not being used.
battery will be discharged in 1 day if used internet it will discharge more fast.
poor battery.
although application opens fast but the display and battery life is very bad.i moved now to then samson os os 5500/- only good battery display and smooth os.
yes moto os is worthy but battery life is even one day some times.it could be very better if the battery capacity is around 3050mah.
received the mobile in time.the packing was also good.this phone is awesome.important plus is that it has more internal memory the mobile is very light and touch sensitivity is good.sound is also quite good.stand by time for battery is also good but i was not satisfied with the headphones its design was so outdated.overall its a good phone for its price.
sons has a 1 go ram compared to asus's 2 go with lollipop upgrade battery performance increases significantly very stable stock andros system no network issue camera is surprisingly good well built and comfortable in hand very satisfied nearly 6 months in use.
part from the battery drain issue with continuous os usage the phone features along with the look is absolutely worth every penny of your investments.

every aspect of this phone is excellent except the battery which almost dies in five hours on connected to wife but normal usage is still fine nine hours but still this phone is the best.
even the battery life is really good.
when we will charged battery show within 2 min 100% charging.
i loved it to death but it suffered increasingly short battery life and would overhead if the screen was on for more than a few minutes.
i have purchased from lip cart and using since last three days and found battery getting drained very fast.worst experience for bad battery back up.

his is my first smartphone and to tell the truth to me its the best budget phone os the performance is beyond expectation , battery life is decent , solid design with a gorgeous look the front facing speakers adding to the beauty.the 8mp rear shorter shoots great pics.no issue of heating or lagging yet inclusion of micro slot and dual aims will make this a perfect phone for those who are planning to buy one.his is my first smartphone and to tell the truth to me its the best budget phone os the performance is beyond expectation , battery life is decent , solid design with a gorgeous look the front facing speakers adding to the beauty.the 8mp rear shorter shoots great pics.no issue of heating or lagging yet inclusion of micro slot and dual aims will make this a perfect phone for those who are planning to buy one.

the battery back is very slightly lesser than the st although it is hardly noticeable.
good phone.but it is giving a low battery back up than geneva s850 and camera quality is also little bit less than geneva s850.
advantages : advantages are everything except the battery.battery 3.).battery 4.).battery (moto can stop selling this shit ) whether they have brain or not i dont know inch os screen 1 os ram android v4.4.4 (kitkat) os 1.2 the qualcomm had more processor 8 os primary camera and 2 os secondary camera 294 pp how these all will satisfies 2070 may ?????????????.though you using it or not battery will drain soon.

every thing is fine from day one as i started using motog2 , the only backing i observed is battery isn reached my exception level but it is os what i experienced with my old shone os.
gros good battery depends on internet usage good camera case of access expandable memory a good upgrade compared to the previous version sons heating.gros good battery depends on internet usage good camera case of access expandable memory a good upgrade compared to the previous version sons heating.
the battery also lasts for quite a while which is an os for them.so, tl/dr: if your looking for a smartphone and are in a budget give this phone a chance.
shone seems quite fragile and battery back is pathetic.

must one thing that i want to mention is battery life is not that much good as i expected.
i recently bought two and one of them had an extremely short battery life down to 17% in 24 his who any use but had no problem getting a replacement from amazon within a couple of days.
the best thing is its speed and the worst is its battery life.
the battery was running out very fast and we are facing big difficulty by this.
the battery lasts a long time if you agent gaming.great price.cons:- james like blood brothers and charge heroes delete the battery in an hour or two.the battery takes longer too charge than my you dash.

good features at right price.long battery life & quick charging.
very little heating after continuous usage.
people who want quality , performance , proper service battery life conductivity and pure andros experience this is the best buy at this price range.
to problem at all!battery life:---------------it's a little disappointing that motorola went with the same sized battery at 2070 mah.his phone will get you through a full day with average use.but if they come out with an lte model later like 2013), they better bump the battery up to at least 2200 mah.his helps phone like moto g a lot.pros:- fig bright 5 inch 720p display (yes, i count 720p as a pro for battery life super cheap price tags reasonable performance degraded 8mp camera great front facing speakers though they may distort a bit at highest volume there great for casual couture sessions microsd expansion slotcons:1.
easy to use 5 battery average.
battery drains a little faster.

the battery back is very low less than 4 his with minimum usage and the speaker is giving some sound all time even when phone not in use.

st mobile worked perfectly, no hardware or software issues except for battery which drained in less than 3hrs.
the battery is also good enough.
everything is good the color sound and much more things but the battery back is not god at all if you would go for internet surging the battery turns up to the low level.everything is good the color sound and much more things but the battery back is not god at all if you would go for internet surging the battery turns up to the low level.
- right in weight bones - screen only 720p - battery drains too fast & takes more time to charge.
the only difference between the two phone is the battery back which is better in the st men external slot doesn really matter because they os harm the phone in many ways.

battery back is just awesome but it tents to vary.sometimes i get like 12-15hrs and sometimes 30 his.one down is that there is no battery percentage shower.so we have to download apes for that.and also to set a ringtone other than the default is difficult.it wont get set.at last i had to copy my ringtones from my scar onto the phone memory to get this thing settled up.

good enough battery life and clear screen.
battery lasts me a couple days of light to normal use.
must a little bit disappointed because of the screen quality when compare to moto g(2013) and also the unknown heating issues when using the camera.
highly disappointed due to this poor performance of the battery.i have used old moto g and performance of battery is best one.but in moto g and genu after full charged and even we didn use internet we could see battery getting discharged and can withstand unto the.
the battery last for 5-6 hours only and it gets heated very quickly.
the only draw back os its battery - medium back up, stand only 9 hrs when wifi os 3 g os mode.battery sholud os upgraded.
os takes too much time for charging around 5 os 6 hours for full charge os the battery.
5)the battery performance is average.
it seems that motorola is dumping off a bad batch of moto g bones as most of the people who are using this shone i know are facing similar issue with the battery.when i approached the service enter i was informed that they already have such bones with them in abundance and that the battery cannot be replaced without an approval os dont know from whom.there isn any definite answer as to if you would get the product replaced or that the battery gets replaced.

vitally battery was not standard that since due to zinc of many apes and they were online.

badly like every other phone it has some disadvantages as well st of all id battery.moto g and men has a battery of 2070 mah.battery drains out pretty fast while you use data connection little bit.while downloading if you play games still be drains out battery extremely fast.tax battery can last 16-18 hours with very moderate use.deep the brightness to very low to save battery.unless its cost too much battery which you canst afford.now as you can see moto g has almost everything to fulfill your demand but it lacks a strong battery power.but of you use it smartly and there are several apes in play store to save battery life which are quite useful still last enough long to serve you.
to i feel the battery life is really good os we all know its faster and can pay for the internal memory and forget to mention its god for gazing.- the clarity of the sound from the speaker is not good especially when it comes to music - battery cannot be removed consider a6000 before buying os.
indeed samsung interface is great but this phone battery back up ram of 1 os and internal space of 16 os makes it a great phone.

the only down side of this phone is the battery.due to battery i am 3 star rating experience with flipkart was excellent.
to problems.need more battery life.
not of good features but battery is where it disappoints , could have been better.
but battery performance is very bad.
only disappointment which i found is for battery back up is not as expected.
battery back is kind of lower but lasts a day for me without any problem in normal usage cam is okay imp cam provides descent clarity images.which also supports panorama hdr, and 1080p video and slowmotion.
am using moto go since one month,,,phone is really awesome,,it has good battery backup,,,good screen resolution,,,and even while playing asphlat 8 game it not getting heat.i really like this phone,,,thanks moto for such a good product.

battery back is good with two him cards and 3g, vocation service and wifi enabled and mix usage it lasts almost 16-18 hours which is quite good.
shone is amazing with exception to battery life.
battery back up is not unto my expectation as per their specification.
the battery must be more powerful one.
been months since i got this phone.its quite fast and works smoothly.the only trouble i noticed(which many others have faced took have searched in goose :p)is that sometimes rarely the whole battery drains out,.
during this time phone battery started draining at a faster rate.before starting recording phone battery was at 60%.after about 15-20 minutes of recording again the sluggishness and unresponsiveness appeared soon after which complete battery drained.
battery is draining like if you surf for 2 hours continuously you need to put charging for 3 more hours.except battery everything is very good.worst battery performance.
battery need to improved.
i have used many andros honest but moto go has disappointed me with respect to battery backup.the battery lasts only for 7-8 his if i have my mobile on data stand by.of you are looking for a better battery please dont go for this.
battery 5/10 for normal usage like a bit gazing some camera use calls sums some gas it will give 8-10 hours back up with auto brightness on while not using the phone i think.i checked for full brightness and much camera use and gaming that it reduce the battery very quickly.in all its a good impressive product and keeping aside the battery issue its a good buy in this range.
battery back of this model or unit received is very poor it does not withstand ever fro 2-3 his without using.
the only thing i found is moto should have speed for 2500/3000 may battery for this.
playing games will drain the battery quickly but if you dont play games on it for long and use it mostly for other things like google maps calendar social media sites web browsing etc you'll probably make it to the end of the day with at least 20% battery left.playing games will drain the battery quickly but if you dont play games on it for long and use it mostly for other things like google maps calendar social media sites web browsing etc you'll probably make it to the end of the day with at least 20% battery left.i have used this phone for several hours straight a few times web browsing facebook, twitter a few games etc and still had more than 30% battery left when i was done.there is a lot of space on this phone especially if you use an os card and use an pp to move apes to the os cards.

to heating problem and the best camera compare to other high end phone and the volume of the loudspeaker are really too god.only disadvantage in this mobile is with the battery.of motorola introduced the rd men with 3000ah battery then it will be the best mobile in the market.
battery back very poor.
camera is good battery is average it long for a day with limited use of net and unlimited music even it is 5 inch it is very handy some sort of disadvantages are there if i use my camera for a while the phone gets heated up it supports org.it should had least 2750mah battery.in my phone the battery save is not working.it supports 1080p video.i am able to take some crisp and cool pictures battery met to test that will post update soon os shone weight also very less seems to be lighter than moto e to people who are considering xaiomi or asusmy recommendation is to just os for moto.

was initially unhappy about the changes to the moto g with the bigger screen and no increase in battery and i would have bought the old one if it was still in stock.the 5 inch screen increases the illusion of a premium phone and the battery suits my personal needs which can be moderate to heavy ( i do not play game on my phone.i have a roommate who got the phone 6 and personally the only thing i envy about his phone is the superb battery life.the phone does take close to 4 hours to go from 0-100% battery so that is a had annoying.

prose good camera good sound of sterno speakers no over heating issues after 5 months of usage phone has never showed an responsive state,or such.battery life is ok if only use is calling,but even connected to internet is enough to drain the phone in less than 10 hours,if you browse,game, whatsapp back is less than 5 hours overall the phone is not outstanding,an average performer.
battery performance os really too poor.

gros : great battery any pp runs on the phone without hanging , screen resolution build of the phone and looks.
i used more couple of andros devices and old moto g as well till now and this moto g next men was poorest battery performance under both os and os network.battery is getting discharged 5-6 hours after full charge which is very pathetic .of you looking for better andros experience with decent battery back this is not what is suggest.

reducing stars to os ================================================================ never thought motorolo would give such a bad product battery drains super fast when g is on.mobile is getting heated up with even few mind of use.video recording gets stopped abruptly after 30 to 40 seas , this happened several times not always but the worst part is nothing gets stored even that 30 -40 seas of video when this problem occurs.i am going to get it replaced after testing for few more days and if the problems persists.hope i will get a better one at least without heating problem.don't buy this low quality product.i could not return it because i bought it on billion day sale.i believe moto is under pressure due to competition and ended up with this low quality product.moto g 1 st gen was so good and this is an insult calling an upgrade to moto go question os flipkart: i noticed that the price label and bar code on the box was tore away !!!.not much heating like the previous one.camera functions properly.overall improvements required os motorolo should have increased the battery capacity while going for a bigger screen.os brightness on the screen is not that great os white color is looking totally plastic.moto g first gen black gave a premium look and feel moto go white looks like cheap local brand build os motorolo could have prices it a little higher another 1000 os or so and improved on the above areas update 23 act there is no heating problem in the new piece and battery also quite stable.os brightness on the screen is not that great os white color is looking totally plastic.moto g first gen black gave a premium look and feel moto go white looks like cheap local brand build os motorolo could have prices it a little higher another 1000 os or so and improved on the above areas update 23 act there is no heating problem in the new piece and battery also quite stable.definitely you wont get a better phone at this price range.could have given it 5 starts if plastic feel / look was not there and screen brightness could have been better with a higher battery capacity.

yeah battery is average.
battery life purely depends on your usage its big screen causes a large drain on the battery so if you are into playing high end games you might have to keep this plugged in very often.battery life purely depends on your usage its big screen causes a large drain on the battery so if you are into playing high end games you might have to keep this plugged in very often.

you canst remove the battery.
overall performance is good but battery charging rate is poor.battery capacity may also be increased with such a big size phone.

there doesn seem to be a compromise in battery life despite the larger screen.

the best thing about the phone being its battery back and no lag on heaving gazing.
the only limiting thing is the battery.

all the features are good good battery good camera etc except one thing is that os does not work.
the phone is really awesome.the touch is very good.there is no overhearing is found.the front cam is also good.the phone is very handy to use.the front speakers work properly even with the dual him and iii i get enough battery back up.the voice quality is good.the motorola emblem looks good.
the phone is awesome, the best feature is the battery backup, but the camera has little fixed issues.
had thing i may face future is of built battery.normally in all smartphones after some time of use shone gets hanged only one way to bring the phone back in action is to remove the battery and place it back and switch it on.were if the phone gets hanged you have to find a service center or have to wait till the battery get empty.
only the concern is with battery backup.
have been using it for two months or so till now i didn find any lag on my phone.every thing works like a charm and the touch experience you get with this phone is battery smooth you will truly fall in love with that amazing technology motorola has equipped with.previously i was using a windows phone and when i checked out this phone when my friend bought this i wished to grab one for me.thanks to its inch display which offers amazing clarity.it doesn feel too big but its fit in your hand easily.i had a white phone and looks wise it feels like a premium set.and the camera is just amazing which is a 8mp shorter and also the front camera which is 2mp is good for video calls.but in complete dark with flash os you might find some noise in pictures and in day light conditions the pick and also the video clarity were awesome.and you get a stock andros experience on this which is the most appreciable one due to which you wont find any lag.call clarity on this phone is good its loud and clear.and for me battery lasts one day was not a power user and with the data on it lasts pretty good actually.i was really wondering how motorola could manage to put in extraordinary features in a budget smartphone.its a very value for money device.you can blind go for it.have been using it for two months or so till now i didn find any lag on my phone.every thing works like a charm and the touch experience you get with this phone is battery smooth you will truly fall in love with that amazing technology motorola has equipped with.previously i was using a windows phone and when i checked out this phone when my friend bought this i wished to grab one for me.thanks to its inch display which offers amazing clarity.it doesn feel too big but its fit in your hand easily.i had a white phone and looks wise it feels like a premium set.and the camera is just amazing which is a 8mp shorter and also the front camera which is 2mp is good for video calls.but in complete dark with flash os you might find some noise in pictures and in day light conditions the pick and also the video clarity were awesome.and you get a stock andros experience on this which is the most appreciable one due to which you wont find any lag.call clarity on this phone is good its loud and clear.and for me battery lasts one day was not a power user and with the data on it lasts pretty good actually.i was really wondering how motorola could manage to put in extraordinary features in a budget smartphone.its a very value for money device.you can blind go for it.

by no means are you going to last all day if you are on it all day but the experts have said they can get 4 hours on screen time before the battery dies.to long battery save apes that dont work anyway!screen: the 5 inch screen looks awesome.must be sure to close out the apes you dont need to reduce chances of slowdowns.network: os with the global version on at&t, that kind up a summer but saves a ton of battery life.

i am using this phone for last 6 months,this is a good at 12999/- but do not expect a good battery backup, with 3g/2g on it sucks it comes hardly 12hrs.
for 3 years i never faced any issue with the os phone except battery drainage or slowness which used to get resolved on resecting the phone again.i had to replace the os battery 2 times during this period.
i have taken 2nd gen moto os but very sorry os say that its battery os not os os mark.
battery enough for day and half with moderate usage only 2g, no 3g) round front facing sterno speakers is a bonus but goodness is less.
only single problem is battery which goes down and is the case of all the android phone.
3 there is no mile manager pp need to download from goose play 4 to meme pp need to download from goose play 5 battery works for 12 hours with full day internet (data & wifi), 4 hours talk time.

battery life is really good(unless u turn on too many push notifications) and i liked the ratification light that links for any call or message notifications.there is no os lte but the data speed so far watching couture video and maps are really fast.

android l makes using os easy on battery.
device is good on the part of performance but battery drains out very quickly.the reality of motorola is that they have very bad service centres(specially if you are in bhubaneswar).

battery performance is very poor.

some phone great graphics and about battery little drawback rest its the best one my first andros.
must started using the phone for a week and is really good in terms of performance.the only minus of the phone is an os os camera and not so great battery.
>pre-installed google apes are great >expandable memory up to 32gb ; st genito expandable memory great feature on moto mobile moto migrate-instant file transfer >motorola assist alert are awesome features later resistant feature and built battery makes to operate easier stylish curve design and light weight all @ 12999/- only not worth os buy samsung mobiles for name sake higher price with less features- not like motorola.
battery lockup problem while suffering internet.
i didn face any kind of lag till now after installing many apply yes the charger bundles with the product is not up to the mark but then i changed my charger and use the one provided with my nexus os and with that charger the cell get full charged in almost one and half hours without heating.many of them said the battery is bad but that not the cases if you are a normal user you'll get almost 16 hours of back which is the best at this price point.
and i haven seen such a symmetrical phone every besides the front cam and slight weight at the battery side one canst tell top or bottom.and yes motorola, or phone will keep us warm during the winters.ha hang must get battery doctor and clean master.
the only bad thing is that having just a month and a half i use the battery lasts less time than when they received having the same use so giving it four stars.
and battery life is also average day maximum in moderate use moto should cut this phone price.and in men it should put at least 2500mah battery.
only con is battery drains out while using os continuously but i guess that happens in any phone while os browsing.
rarely use a cell phone since i live in a very rural area with bluff all around so cell signals are quite spotted and i would expect the battery to last much longer however i do have several apes installed so that may be the culprit.4).

since speck are available on the net just a quick noting of experiences cross - good solid build and feel - lip cover also available on flipkart strongly recommended - good camera both in still and video - average battery life - gorilla glass screen - no screen guard required bones - a little under lowered - lag while twitching apes / sluggish response - in sim so get yours cut / changed in advance os - camera could have been better for the price point and reliable performance - recommend it !.
battery is average you will need to charge once a day at normal usage.
the lesser the ppi the lesser load on cpu so the same battery on moto g could handle the extra screen real-estate.battery: --------------- i am not a camera but i do browsing a lot.misc ------------------------- to heating issues on os or in calls.no idea on gaming.a cool device.

battery will drain at end of day.after using net,gaming music player and all.
i would give a review on the following points display-fairly good and no distortion in pipes observed even when the phone is held up close to the eyelid is also water resistant and with gorilla glass 3 no effect of scratches or drops i dropped it twice accidently it nothing happened os battery backup-fairly good although it would last longer as the andros l update would add juice to it.could.software-pretty much stock andros with no file explorer but u can always install third party apes which work fearlessly and the most important feature is that it will receive andros l update any time soon which is a great feature as it comes with enhanced battery power and material design.plays.

round a problem in the phone when switched off for 12 hours battery gets automatically drained off.
the only drawback that i see is the battery.
most of the reviews in other sites complained about the battery performance but for me its quite good as per the current operating statistics of smartphone batteries.
received this device just yesterday.7 days before the expected delivery date.thanks to flipkart for the fast delivery.the device is absolutely brilliant.it came preinstalled with andros 5.0.2 lollipop.and the phone runs battery smooth.there was no lag found when i switched from one pp to the other app.the display is fantastic.the viewing angles are great.the touch is very good.and the dual sterno speakers are quite loud and decent as well.the phone looks very sturdy in the hands.so in a nutshell i would say that this device is definitely a bang for the buck.and one would get a very decent andros experience similar to that on high end smartphones at exceptional low price.
to issues with battery backup.
have been using the phone for 6 days and i think battery life has scope for improvement.
battery back is poor.there need to improve in battery backup.

battery is oka.
i can only imagine that its because of the lollipop updated but the phone frequently acts as if its unable to adequately run the os.it's also started notifying me that the battery has completely discharged even after its been on the charger all day.also the smaller battery is incredibly disappointing in contrast to the earlier iteration.i purchased this as a cheaper alternative to a oneplus one but i regret that decision almost daily.
i would buy it again or for someone else!only one con really for me i wish the battery life lasted longer.
battery performance is just like andros phone but slight better than others.

well to start of the os screen and the resolution are quite impressive along with the overall design the moto go is superior to any other phone which comes in the same price range but what the problem was is that it heat up while using internet or playing games and drains battery considerably.

only con of this phone is its battery.its draining like hell just getting 5-6 hours battery back up.either u r using g or g network battery will drain very fast n if u r playing games listening music battery will drain in just 4-5 hours that means u he to sit near charging point every now n then gros of moto os its camera is perfectly good images can be taken in light her support is best flash helps greatly in low light games can be played smoothly than to its snapdragon quand core processor but u ll notice 1 or 2 laws in high graphics games storage of d phone is just vast vaaaaaaast.either u r using g or g network battery will drain very fast n if u r playing games listening music battery will drain in just 4-5 hours that means u he to sit near charging point every now n then gros of moto os its camera is perfectly good images can be taken in light her support is best flash helps greatly in low light games can be played smoothly than to its snapdragon quand core processor but u ll notice 1 or 2 laws in high graphics games storage of d phone is just vast vaaaaaaast.all only say that go for it but u he to compromise on battery back up which is a blunder committed by the motorola.
battery back up is not unto mark.
would have done better with the battery.
shone is decent to use however battery needs to be more powerful.
it might be better if the battery back has increased.
battery really could have been improved the 2070 may is not enough for a 5 inch phone.i still wonder why they didn increase the battery capacity when they upgrade the previous moto os.the battery is built-in and non-removable.
os a previous shone user my wife old 3gs), i needed to upgrade to something with more battery life and an os that would allow me to run the latest apply.os its like a small tablet with emergency internet and phone when needed.the screen is larger than the 3gs, battery life longer and him no longer in the apple ecosystem but went into the google system.
very good product and it is very stylish phone its very easy to use also but battery power is tittle bit less please improve that if u do its best for ever.
camera is awesome.i got the mobile with already updated lollipop.the only thing which is frustration is the battery dont know whether him using it too much or there is some problem with the battery itself.camera is awesome.i got the mobile with already updated lollipop.the only thing which is frustration is the battery dont know whether him using it too much or there is some problem with the battery itself.
the battery life is about one complete day with at least 40 above oncoming and outdoing calls 15 minutes of skype, a half an hour mail checking and watching 4 or 5 rev anand/rajesh khanna/shammi poor songs on the youtube.
battery performance took etc.
i purchased this product 10 days back and observed battery is not up to mark.
battery life is oka but the may capacity itself could have been more.
good product but battery back is not good even-though i turn off all option like bluetooth, wife reduce display brightness go location mobile data.
minor drawback battery life is good but not great then it requires too much time for charging.
full he video support and one day battery backup.
using moto g 2 for 2 weeks its battery is the worst one it takes 4 hours to charge it fully.
very nice looking unable high resolution screen life battery normal.
features very good battery no need to twice a day excellent camera(with good room quality excellent touch network coverage is good also round quality sterno sound in speaker and much more.
the battery life is good for me it lasts a day and a half with just basic usage.anything to help indicate which is the top of the phone.pros.great quality screenperfect size not too large (phablet) or too small.fastcharges battery much quicker than my old galaxy s2.consi dont get as good a reception inside my house as i did with my old galaxy siiit needs some kind of label or identified to tell which is top and bottom.no charging been or alert when its finished charging.
will this day i have not experienced any trouble with the phone except the battery life which too holds good for one day without fail.
battery performance is koko no hanging.
i caught this phone on 5 january 2015, but phone was not unto expectation and battery back is poor and flipkart dont take any responsibility of replacement , i got call when i raise a request regarding replacement and they deny replacement of phone.
i bought moto g just two months back and its battery is almost dead red up of the backup.and its not like its battery is dead now from the day 1 its not giving the back as expected beside this camera quality is also not good.but i suggest if u r looking for good battery and camera then do not go for it.

product is good but having some problem with battery get heated and on large volume voice clarity is not so good.
battery is only thing i felt bad.
little battery related problem , gets drains soon.
pain reason to chose moto g is for battery backup.even though zenphone has go ram under 10000 price tags it lacks in battery backup.such satisfied with the battery.
os the battery life is awesome.plus the battery gets headed when charged.
weak battery and it takes too much to charge system speed is very slow .

god battery backup.
by using the same for 2 weeks here is my views right weight feels so due to size smooth touch experience good battery life.
very poor battery back-up like china cheap phone , andros software is just install not any change like samsung or bony some additional pp performance is like 3000 to 5000 rule phone perform.battery charge in the and drain in 6 he.
moto g and men perfectly fits in hand and the back cover gives good grip i have run high end graphics games and everything was smooth without any lags.camera is good but the auto focus is a bit late,battery life is also a bit unsatisfactory.
i got this phone for my wife because she wanted a bigger screen and i was pleasantly surprised i ended up wanting one for me i have a galaxy s4, which is superior but for this prices the moto is an excellent choice the colors are crisp and beautiful the speakers are facing up which is great since you actually hear ratification sounds when placed on a flat surface the battery life is more than decent the camera take beautiful pictures the ratification bar is a bit annoying since you have to click twice to get all the information but most of the little kinds you can solve by installing a good launched from goose play i can believe this phone is this good for this prices you can go wrong.
its a very vice mobile with lots of latest features and very rough which satisfy haste free usage rose camera screen resolution talk time roughness sons to g video calling on removable battery.
unlike any other andros phone the battery back is the only problem i face in this mobile.

the phone definitely loose out to competition on the point of lesser ram older processor lesser ppi and smaller battery capacity.battery life has been good so far.i have been a very heavy and advanced user of phone some of them have been of the highest specie and now all i want from my phone is to have a responsive functional and unable experience with a good camera and good battery while not burning my purse.

not much of a heating to be feared of.
as far as battery life i have yet to get at least 24 hours with usually about 15% left.mostly i keep screen brightness at or below 50% and use battery saver.i could go on and on about this smartphone but all i can say is that i like it very much and am glad i now continue with the my less than 10 bucks a month personal communication using mobile repaid minutes and wife phone next he pp in one user friendly , efficient and sex device with all the bells and whistles i need and then some at a bargain of a price.the $179 moto g and gen is one neck of a deal.one other things dont waste your money on screen protectors.the moto g and gen comes with gorilla glass which takes an awful lot of effort to scratch.
i everything is os in this phone but i found two main disadvantage st battery back up is not good and and sar value is higher than others rest of this i like it .

the processor is very good and there is no hidden apes running in the background which might eat battery or slow the process.for the first tm drain the battery completely and charge keeping the phone off.once battery is celebrated its nice.but need to mention i dont play games os i just use it for songs , whatsapp, os and general couture browsing.
only worst thing is bad battery backup.
flipkart shipped me phone within one week doubles my pleasure i am using this phone for last 2 month and didn find a single point to criticize it from camera performance everything is excellent even battery is ok also.
good display,good camera and good processor only drawback is a little less ram(it shed he been 1.5gb) and battery life(only 2070 mah).with an ave use the battery last only for 24 hrs.so u need to charge it almost every day call quality and reception is also good can handle games like mc4, shalt with ease.and motorola has already confirmed that moto g will get andros 5.0 before winter break which is something that places this device far ahead from all other smartphones in the race.
also the battery life is pretty short.

only problem is battery back is not for whole day when using wife or mobile network.
the phone is amazing it does not get heated up and can last for 2 days with minimal use on battery.

i am impressed with the device at many printers like display size , clarity , easy to use system , all quality , camera , os etc the things that i am not liking are display is a bit yellowish not completely white , battery runs out to 40 % by evening she is back from office just with normal usage of the phone a window 8.1 or 10 os in the same device would definitely let me buy 1 for self i am not a fan of android any given day.
i am using both moto g st gen and 2 genu only the problem is battery back in and men.of i make full charge in night it will stay till evening but 1 st gen battery back will stay 1 and 1/2 day.manufacturer need to think to provide higher battery back for moto go.
dear sir pus dont buy a moto g os its very hanging battery is very tempered above 48 degree using a camera this is my second mobile flipkart motor g os the new mobile also again the same problem.
the second one i got had the same problems and also its battery was draining at a super fast speed.
take bellies and unload them instantly without worrying about the battery.
some things that i think can be improved are os battery life i can still manage 1 whole day on less than average usage.
now battery backup.
battery back up is not that great.
delivery was in time i did not get hittel 6 months free data usage which was given in the offers battery gets discharged so quickly.
just drawback is battery.
in i used many andros device till now and this moto g next men was poorest battery performance under both os and os network.of you looking for better andros experience with decent battery back this is not what is suggest.
only battery is little worry but its manageable not like samsung.camera is awesome stylish phone .
average battery life.
awesome mobile but battery is not good.its battery has not good back but net browsing is good.
also the battery gets drained quickly.
battery life so so.
overall the battery life and the camera picture quality is quite good for a phone at this price range.
have even taken the battery out but it starts up frozen.
the battery life is good.
started the day with full battery at 6:30 os and by 8:15 , of constant listening to music and using os + os the battery reached 76%.started the day with full battery at 6:30 os and by 8:15 , of constant listening to music and using os + os the battery reached 76%.to i am not sure if the battery will last the day.
battery back up not so bad.lollipop os performance is superb.it takes 2-3 hours for 100%charge using the charger provided with the phone.while using charger of any other brandy it take below 1 hour to reach 100% battery.
its smooth fast crisp in display did not face any problems so far no heating call drops.battery seems on the lower side but you canst get everything for this prices.
battery life can be only problem but one can always buy power banks for that also charger supplied is only 550 my output so very slow charging.
not sure if its my device only or is a genetic heating problems.also observed that the battery drains out quickly.
lovely phone.no lags,battery lasts for one day.u wont regret after buying this.
i have ordered this phone and it had some issue like excessive heating up so flipkart has changed it but with now the replacement piece game has started.
i feel better in performance and battery back should be improved for it.only problem is battery life.
it this price range moto gives his best and i am very satisfied this its processor they give me all features what i want in a mobile camera is good front camera is also good touch is nice and smooth dual speakers works perfect battery back is good built quality is superb.
battery duration its optical unless your gaming you can last a whole day with moderate usage.built quality seems sturdy and phone itself so heavy so you can add a protective case without making it so heavy.
excellent battery backup.
the battery life will seem a bit less for people into gazing.
2070mh battery os master speed due to good quality & upgrade processor sensory work is excellent music quality good specially by ear wrapped headphone.
the battery life is great and lasts unto a day on heavy usage.initially the battery will take unto 6 hours to charge but after a few days it wont take much time and please os not the motorola charger, use some other charger of samson or sonya because the phone will get charged quickly.
battery back all as expected and competitive.
i order micromax micro from amazon it was also good 1 issue happened in nitro was when battery reached 50% within 2 hours the cell phone switches off.
battery life ok have to still charge twice a day with moderate use.

easy touch.but i think battery back time is some what less.satsified with motorola.good one than samson and other brandy.

its has the same awesome battery.
the os had to come out of the drawer again but its total lack of apes made it no better than a feature phone albeit with one tenth of the battery life.so, not having used a motorola since the dynatac, this was quite a surprise.it is really fast the screen is gorgeous - sharp with rich colors the device is thin enough the camera is quite oka battery life is quite good it is light enough and the phone is not too ugly.
after 3 months of usage visited moto g service centre multiple times on phone heating problems.in every delivery of the mobile the service centre folks mention mobile display was replaced had a talk with few customers almost everyone had same mobile heating problems.you are lucky if it works without any heating problems.
while in the call the device is getting over heated might be battery part 2.i had bad experience while browsing battery is draining even phone is fully charged in the morning.
os battery.even with all these running whole day the battery stays above the critical level.
the battery life is only so-so.i keep my screen at lowest brightness mobile data off and use only wifi, but even then the battery does not last for more than 6-8 hours.
battery back is quite oka.in normal use battery discharge only 50% in 12-13 he.
good performance,good battery back i like this mobile------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.

battery discharges faster on g but everyone knows that **cons - the only thing that i would like to point out is that the charger provided with it tends to heat the device a little while charging.

i bought motorola moto g and genet 3 months back but the piece i got has many problems such as touch insensitiveness battery getting discharged , speaker noise phone getting switched off in between the calls etc but the worst problem is after sales service.motorola has horrible after sales service.

mobile camera capturing less quality and dull pictures and battery back up is less time comparing with other 2000mah mobile.
overall shone is superb under ask but major problem of battery lockup & mobile gets not after some time use camera is very good with additional panaroma function.one star less because of only battery problem.
i found only two consul os battery back is not unto the expectation.
his phone is very good with its shining features like go ram , 16gb internal storage , imp camera etc working good with good battery power.
however the battery drain is a big issue.to heavy games no excessive download n surging just usual chats n phone calls n still m shocked to see my battery entering the red zone by the th hours.only fr the battery drain i regret buying this phone.

but still when you compare all these things with the speed of the phone battery back-up, overall user interface and amazing features you forget about the sons of the products.
the delivery was made within a day and i love the phone and the battery lasts about one day with moderate use(3g,internet,moderate gaming,chatting,calls) overall a good buy i would say.you wont regret.
battery life os low.
battery performance with stock andros ui makes it look good.
pro and sons are battery back is too good for a inches 2.
the positive things first - really good grip and smart look - google apes smartly integrated - very competitive prices - excellent picture and video quality shoots really well in low light conditions - hard scratch proof screen so u need not even put a screen cover - enough storage space and dual sim shots - fig screen size to fit in all the most used apes and modifications now the negative - the battery life is a real showdown - have to charge everyday irrespective of use - not possible to personality ringtone - sms does not have one of the most useful feature - drafts - to touch screen feature to turn the phone to silent / vibrating mode - door quality head phone - the charger should have detachable data cable - creating profile is not possible - burns slow when multiple applications are used though i would still rate this in the mid range of the scale given that it helped me to upgrade in terms of the enhancements i was looking for in a smart phone.
battery is ok for a day if you dont brows much.vice design battery is reasonable.
it this price range i preferred this phone to everyone after hardly using i m writing this review there is only one sons in the phone that is battery life but if u use it properly then battery is also good and other functionality look and flipcart service is great as always no lag in the phone additional features give you great experiences dont this more just buy it os.it this price range i preferred this phone to everyone after hardly using i m writing this review there is only one sons in the phone that is battery life but if u use it properly then battery is also good and other functionality look and flipcart service is great as always no lag in the phone additional features give you great experiences dont this more just buy it os.

vice upgrade from moto g but could have added more juice to battery and display.rose shone look and feel is very good voice camera front & rear smooth touch response flag free processing *awesome speakers and call voice clarity is also very good os inch screen but still handy to use sons volume & power buttons not handy to press display is not very sharp as 5 inch but still 720p battery could have been better least 2500 may overall the moto g and men is awesome upgrade to its predecessor moto g except few minor pitch hence rating it 4 stars.
hanging , battery exhausted not a handy mobile .
bought it for my dad actually selected cos he only paid for it.,,,well about the products battery was my main concern and its good as he makes decent number of calls.on a lighter note my days only complaint was that battery icon was too small.
within a week one started to give battery problem - it drained from 80% to 30% in a couple of minutes.
battery life is beyond expected.
battery life gives me approximately an hour more of screen on time as compared to the nexus os overall and say a 20% improvement(lasts a day easily with medium to heavy use -sdcard: huge prominent for buying the moto g2.non-removable battery and always like the option to pop a new battery in os 4 and a half stars.non-removable battery and always like the option to pop a new battery in os 4 and a half stars.
some nice i like it.but battery 1 charge in very single day and touch will more fast ,,, moto g and men phone is good .5 inch display will be awsome,i like it.
the camera is very good even the front cam is very decent.the shone is easily a winner in the low budget segment.in os 15000 you can not get better than this am loving my phone.the only drawback is the battery which takes near 3 hours to get fully charged otherwise the shone is excellent in all other specification.
it is a good product by motorola,but one mistake like battery.increase the battery may unto 2600mah.
recent battery dual him phone with all features in my budget sons over heating.recent battery dual him phone with all features in my budget sons over heating.
battery back up not so god quiet god mobile.
battery charges slowly and drains quickly.
after dating lollipop version its battery back also increased.
the mobile speakers are not working properly and not getting battery back like my brow moto go so please check and decide your self but one thing all the mobile are not like this os.
utter smooth good cam recent battery and display loud speakers and good built quality con.
battery drains very quickly.
the moto g version battery performance is very much disappointing.
but there is problem in the battery losses.because the moto g is 5 inch display but the battery capacity is remains same that is 2070 mah .all are nice except battery.
only desert point is battery backup.
dear reviewers, all android mobile having below 3000 may are having below average battery life.playing games and surging net using blue tooth and hearing/viewing songs/movies swallow most of the battery power and one will have to charge twice per day;for nominal users this mobile is a boon and for voracious net and game users i recommend pioneer os which has 5000 may lowered battery.playing games and surging net using blue tooth and hearing/viewing songs/movies swallow most of the battery power and one will have to charge twice per day;for nominal users this mobile is a boon and for voracious net and game users i recommend pioneer os which has 5000 may lowered battery.
the stylish build and user and user interface #5" display loud and good quality front loudspeakers amazing camera quality.and also a very good front cam which takes amazing series os lightning speed processor without any lag or hang os os rram external memory expandable unto 32gb even with 16gb internal bones pretty average or below par battery difficult to get accessories as the product is new to market but i am sure this will get resolved in a matter of weeks os poor quality headphones .
interface and operating system are good but battery back it bad (8hrs of intermediate usage and gets really hot and stuck while playing high end games.
i am very disappointed with moto os battery backup.after full charge it lasts hardly for 5-6 hours only and on standby it lasts for 12-14 hours only.seems to be a 1000mah battery only.to not buy this phone if you want a long battery life.
best mobile phone in this price range its camera pretty good display battery back up is fine one drawback of this phone is during calls other person behind u can easily hear voice of another person who is on the call.
hardware-wise is very cool slim with a big screen great resolution battery lasts more than usual after i got home after work i still have 50% of it so it is great.being a music lover i like to have my phone packed with pus and guess what well there is something wrong with kitkat 4.4.4 that you can only use google lay music to listen to it any other player there is will give you problems the audit all of a sudden will stop playing actually 2-3 minutes and all stop when the audit doesn stops the playlist will jump to the next song without the current one is not over.
ought the phone when it was first launched(sep-end) from flipkart.was going good for a while(only minor hiccups like difficulty is starting phone when the battery drain).
battery back up issue.
battery back is really poor.
my phone battery back not good in phone charging time phone heat i am not satisfied moto go please solve my problem.
respectable for a smart phone battery life.
battery life tends to be poor.i use it with wife thought and the battery hardly lasts for one full day.but today i got the lollipop 5.0.2 upgrade so lets see if the battery life improves.sinus one star due to battery.
battery not charging .display is also good but battery charger got heated up st time and den and time mobile itself is not charging.
battery lasts a long time.
product is good battery.
battery life - shone should last very easily least 24 hours with normal use.
to issues connecting to our home network and my wife work wifi.cons: to 4glte, on removable battery to included headset/ear buds.
battery reasonable.to heating and auto cut off after full recharge.
though the battery back up is less.
battery 2070mah .that might average while seeing in number but let me tell you battery back is quite amazing .you wont have any issues regarding the battery back .only bad thing about battery is that it takes way too much time to charge .(idk the exact time but its little higher than samson mobile of this battery capacity 4.
very good phone moto is best than all other chinese phone battery can withstand for a full day with heavy usage.
after the lollipop updated phone laws very much battery back up is also running down.
yes i got lollipop on 24 jan its amazing phone working good no laws battery ok camera nice over all its worthy to buy.
os thumbs down for battery backup.
long battery life 4.
prone budget phone camera quality good sound good touch good cost battery charging speed very very slow laws in lollipop handgrip not convenient.
i did not find much issues with battery life however it will be a bit early to comment anything about this.eating this device as 4 star as i wanted to get the battery at least of 2900 mah.
hi.im using moto os for the past 4 months.this is my second phone.it is an awesome phone.exceptional phone for exceptional price.average battery performance which can stay for more than a day.updated my moto go to 5.0 lollipop version.i love my phone.
over all moto g and gen is great phone except no nfc and no user-replaceable battery.
i dont know the reason why i am not comfortable with the and genu is that reason the screen with less ppi, os that the reason the call quality seems to be choice is that the reason the font and pp logs seems larger than the usual moto g st genu is that the reason battery which is poor in comparison with its old friend dont know.i am missing my old moto g now which i have given to my sister wish flipkart & moto bring the old one back into place.
most useful is that its not heating at all.
company should give removable battery with the hands instead of giving fix batteries bow the phone is awesome in the price.
mobile was working for only 5 days the were not able to start the mobile after the battery got drained and charged as well .
i have faced lots of issue with this products like battery issue biting issue network issue.
the battery is not so great.
moto g has always been high on performance battery back + responsiveness + performance).
problems poor battery capacity network issue:even after installing the network settings,cannot connect to internet from my vodafone him.
but has low battery backup.

~lollipop ~quadcore - no lagging os os ram - sufficient ~ 16 os rom - super os mp, 2 os came decent quality ~5" os screen - fine picture quality ~ but battery capacity should have been more than 2500mah.
3)battery is average , need to charge everyday even with normal usage.
though the mobile camera and battery back are good.
the mobile battery is very poor back and in standby mode it works only 4 hours maximum.the mobile battery is very poor back and in standby mode it works only 4 hours maximum.
built battery(can not changes is the only one problems.
battery is some what decent display is good.
other thing which i dint like is one can peronalize ringtones in this have to download a file manager battery is overall good.it.
2-battery-the battery gets drained very fast and passing even a day without charge becomes tough.
the shone looks "awesome" and no more issues like by old mobile and the main important thing - the battery life is excellent.
good phone no complaint of heating long battery life as promised light weight never hang.good phone no complaint of heating long battery life as promised light weight never hang.
speed delivery very good battery back and cool and large display.it is the best phone i had purchased till date gaming is superb to hanging battery back up is ok and but only one problem is the headset it is the old one not watching to the standard of motorola.
training of battery is just a problem otherwise this phone is very good.
but the battery back need to be increased and ringtone and sms option not there for two sims.
amazing fast battery recharging.
i put a 32gb micro os card in mine.con----- battery life.his is my first large screen smartphone so i am not used to short term battery life.i think windows operating system is just more efficient than andros when it comes to using ram and battery power.i think with the large os screen and the lollipop system with so many running background apply it uses a lot of unnecessary ram and battery power.i noticed the power through your day with the allay battery in the description as if that is something to brag about.him using clean master pp and disabled lot of unnecessary pp modifications so i may squeeze a one and half day battery power now.maybe in the future i will get lollipop 5.1 or another update that will improve battery life.i will look into getting a cheap portable battery charger too.all the pro easily compensated for the lackluster battery life.of you are a lesser user you may get a day and a half battery use.
now my findings are sons os battery percentage not displayed in status bare.3 - issue with battery.4 - battery drops down inconsistently.
the features included in this mobile are good,but i would give a 5 star if the battery back would have been better.
giving 4 stars due to poor battery otherwise it would have been five.only issue is with battery back up.even with minimum usage battery doesn last for long.
shone is good for moderate use battery life is on down side needs to be charged twice a day not recommended for games with bluetooth console and all as ram is limited.
i think solo is better at-least cheaper then moto g. poor battery backup.i have been using the phone for 2 weeks now & can complain on anything am very happy with battery backup.will now zero problems high quality display no hanging issues no heating issues high picture quality and overall it is an excellent mobile.
only on i observed is battery lifetime os.
battery life is not up to the expectation.
shone is awesome with nice smooth touch and works fast as compared to samsung prime battery is is too good.
eating it for 4 due to battery capacity which is 2070mah had it been 2500mah i would have given star os.worst andros phone i have ever seen.absolutely sensitive screen but gets broken easily comparing to other touch screens.poor battery backup.those who prefer moto g and generation should carry their battery back with them.gets hanging frequently while using internet.whenever we start use this hands it gets heat.among all very costly to service the phone when the screen gets broken.worst andros phone i have ever seen.absolutely sensitive screen but gets broken easily comparing to other touch screens.poor battery backup.those who prefer moto g and generation should carry their battery back with them.gets hanging frequently while using internet.whenever we start use this hands it gets heat.among all very costly to service the phone when the screen gets broken.
