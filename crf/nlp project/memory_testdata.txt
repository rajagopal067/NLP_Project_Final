5 inch screen expandable memory dual front speakers 8mp rear camera and 2 os front camera surely put this in one of the top contended in did range andros phone market.
the modification that has done to go compared go are quite appreciative interest of expandable memory slot though its more than sufficient for pp lovers.
it has sufficient features for a regular user with enough memory.
memory 1 os of ram is simply not enough for a lollipop updated i dont know any technicalities but it just does not feel enough .
expandable memory os be sure to add a memory card and store photos and multimedia there as internal storage is tight.expandable memory os be sure to add a memory card and store photos and multimedia there as internal storage is tight.
memory too less - os it.
and one think i like that all apes or game directly install in internal memory there is no more load on ram.
good hardware for the money.bad: low and responsive after 3 months of use require report or memory cleaning some time.
performance : i have installed more than 90 apes none moved to sd card memory checked with the multitasking none of them crashed if u use 4 apes consistently the since the stock andros consumed less am i hardly get 350-200 mb free so i rooted moto g managed to get 500 mb removed the moto g apes such as assist,alert etc these apes were consuming lots of ram , 3.
he removed him and memory card and disassembled the phone.
of you want to avail 1gb same with good internal memory then this would be surely a great choice.
the g model and this one will accept memory cards but they os not like the fattest available.
great 16gb memory awesome camera features.
instead you can spend that money on memory card and good quality earphones.
good product with add on feature of memory card storage and 5 inch is best.no words as such only feel a bit about the build quality of the back cover.
easily upgradable to android 5.0.2 lollipop.i got it.awesome graphics.never update in samson cell 2.
i has used mi3,moto e,iphone 4s,but this one grab my attention,looks sturdy,amazing performance,but battery drains quickly,expandeble memory option really good,fits in hands,so far no defects detected,black is awesome,but ordered a white one waiting for it.
internal memory good.
the speed internal memory pre installed apply moto alert pp are awesome.
it comes with a standard 8gb memory.
tried playing from internal memory and external micro sd cards.
of motorola can add some more memory with this phone its become awesome then.
it is getting fitted in and sloth memory given by company is 16 gb.however the mobile is showing only 12.90 os memory.
him pretty sure this is a low memory issue since this phone only has 1gb of ram.only 4 stars instead of 5 because of the slow down and auto closing of apes when memory runs low.on a side note the manual says not to use a him card adapted with this phone but have been using a naso to micro him adapted with no problems you just need to get a quality one.
it just do not get saved in the internal memory at all.
excellent display and upgradable andros lolipop camera is decent at this price tag build quality is moto.
i was already a fan of moto g since last years the only reason for not picking was lack of expandable memory.
problem which i faced os os speakers not working os memory card slot not reading os him slot not working os touch screen not working properly os hanging problem os battery life not good os charger even after 2 months not working i'll suggest not os buy os .
to my answer you'll get these all in one your answer is moto os , you are getting snapdragon processors squad core), with great gpu, 1 os ram, 16 os internal memory.even shalt and nova os memory is 16 go so no issues in storage also you can install unto 64 os card as well.
the biggest problem that i have faced that hands doesn support 16 os memory card however the hands supporting capacity is 32 os very funny).
download happen quickly and the memory space is enough.
all quality - didn have any issues with noise / rebound screen size and its 720p resolution neutral : speakers - not loud enough - but managable want comment on expandable memory / camera - as i dont have much use for them.
the only think to disappoint was there was nothing free product with the phone neither the lip cover nor the memory card and not even the screen guards.
i was already a fan of moto g since last years the only reason for not picking was lack of expandable memory.
expandable memory.
very few apes installed thus free of bloatware consuming memory only the goose apps).
i am not able to save several contact nose to internal memory of phone.
to need to switch it off for changing aims or memory cards.
i opened least 12 apes and no lag or shortage of memory only on is battery back is little less but that oka.
os expandable memory only unto 32gb, where market standard is 64gb os charging time much much higher compared to apple shone os to data cable.
really unless your a power user and you dont want to be conscious of how much memory your apes use while doing in the background this is definitely a phone worth considering for any budget if your looking to save money.
mitka with 16 os internal memory and 8 began fixed rear and 2 meg fixed front camera.
i bought this product os replacement os samsung galaxy grand & i os fully satisfied with the features i got i forgot the problem os lacking memory and os never hangs i os fully satisfied with this product os motorola.
but also you can increase your memory by inserting the micro os cards.
you have 30 days if my memory serves correct after date of purchase to buy the warranty through the motorola website.tldr: decent phone at a price too good to pass up just remember a micro hard.
you can use the whole internal memory of phone for installing games and applications and your video and audit files can be stored in sd card which is course a great advantage.
but if you can afford it its much better than red os as it free internal memory around 12.7 go which helps lot while loading big games.also the andros 5.0 update will consume much internal memory because of the changed api's so ultimately 16 go internal memory is any day better than go internal memory.also the andros 5.0 update will consume much internal memory because of the changed api's so ultimately 16 go internal memory is any day better than go internal memory.also the andros 5.0 update will consume much internal memory because of the changed api's so ultimately 16 go internal memory is any day better than go internal memory.
pros: everything is the best you can get in this price range from display,sound,touch,camera,performance,memory to build,look,buttons etc cons: front sterno speakers really not that loud.
these for is good but have a huge drawback that is battery(2020mah) using from 7 month these bones battery consumption like any sports biceps petrol pros-have sex look camera is oak but not enough good interface after lollipop for memory is enough cost already mentioned battery is not suitable for g network networking automatically changed g to g if network fluctuates that is frustatting not like samson that remain unchanged my personal advise go for new updated for later going for these old.
reason is moto runs stock andros which saves lot of memory providing you the best andros experience.
the cell phone is great but they missed up with the memory management of the android.
this is the best mid range andros phone for now os pros os packed with snapdragon 400 os pretty decent enough for this price battery is way better than expected (media-core user am myself very nice display two comes with stock andros experience feels solid best nearly no been dual sterno speakers will blow you away expandable memory guaranteed updated for andros l cons os camera performance was worse even being equipped with imp only one microphone outdoor visibility could have been better phone doesn come with micro us us cable headphones are cheap by built and audit quality the plastic bells surrounding the top face were quite disappointing making it feel cheap.
that i like about moto g - fig screen high quality in that pricking range - very fast - excellent memory card extension slot.love you motoroal for that.
when i got my moto g at first then it is lolipop upgradable and it have display problem and when i replace it then it contain kitkat.

its the closest thing to having a nexus without paying much which means that you receive updated and about the best andoroid possible experience accompanied by a card 32 os micro os is almost perfect since you can install your applications in the card and free up space on its 8 os of internal memory which are the only deficiency if it came in a choice of at least 16 os would be the perfect phone but motorola seems to not give the 16gb versions that can cannibalize high range moto x.always very fluid runs almost anything you throw smoothly it is amazing how an android phone with only 1 os of ram can work as well but that the advantage of receiving android updated now with lollipod makes the range cell average work about as well as any high end.
