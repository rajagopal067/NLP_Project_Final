Even though Zenphone has 2gb ram under 10000 price tag, It lacks in battery backup. I have been using this for the past 2 weeks. Overall satisfied with the performance as well as camera quality. It has big 5 inch screen with superb build quality and design. Much satisfied with the battery.",

Luckily in warranty period, I got the motherboard replaced. just 3 days back i got my phone back and here now i am writing this review! The primary camera is not working properly. Its giving blurred images. Some issue with the auto focus. I spoke to Motorola customer support, the personel suggested me to do factory reset. I had to do the whole procedure again. And i am again back to the square one. Once again i spoke to the moto customer care, they asked me to take it to the service centre. Why do i have to make rounds of the service centre every now and then. It was woking properly before giving for servicing, I find here that these are some workmen whom motorola has given authority and they are not exclusively for Motorola. I DON'T TRUST TO GIVE MY PHONE TO THESE SERVICE CENTRES AGAIN. But i am left with no option. Somehow i could claim for my money back. and I wish I knew this before.",

I asked for replacement of the product but first Flipkart customer service mailed me some troubleshooting steps of fixing dead pixels, but it did not work. I don't think the spot is due to dead pixels. After telling them again they accepted the return and scheduled it for delivery till 7th Jan. Thanks to Flipkart for helping me out. I'm eagerly waiting for the phone and will write a complete review after I receive the final product.",

That Phone was bad and slow so I got exchange offer I switched it with this GEM. I have used Nexus 5, Grand 2 and Grand 1 for two days each. I think Grand 1 and 2 is no where in competition with this phone. Battery is same to canvas so I know how to use this new phone but it is almost 24 hr still battery running on Wifi And whatsapp. I am not heavy user. but still In office wifi is connected for 8 hrs this phone survived easily. Screen is vivd 295ppi. camera is awesome, slow mo 720p is perfect. Phone is delicate i dont know why but I cant Put my phone even in Pocket :P now buttons for volue lock key are decent. Now the call quality thing: you have to set the volume to 50% or anyone can listen to your call. Wifi Signal catching is in good range. Dual speakers are same if you set on high volume sound will crack but set it on 80% I have used only for 24hr I will update after every one week month and six onths just to help some of my fellas out there who are reading and get confused about what to buy in budget range cause budget is big thing for us. 5 stars fpr phone display,camera. Used this phone for more more than 10 days it is working well pictures are clear. battery back up is for more than one day for me( wifi 24 hr even in office and home+low brightness whole time). head phones are cheap quality but why the charger and headphones are white? I dont understand the concept. I already have the skullcandy headphones working well with this device. I will update after one month. Till now the best of the best! Used it for months now I have started using more more brightness and high end gaming with graphics. All is set for 12 hours ( full time wifi on and 40% screen brightness ) phone is bit slow while switching to apps while playing games. Battery is kind of drawback but screen resolution pics are amazing. Will update after month. 18/02/2015 Phone is working well. Awesome hats off to moto for 5.0.2 update.",

If I would use any type of screengaurd my touch screen would start to act funny. I hated it.it was also pretty slow. I ordered for a replacement and got it within 1 day. The new one did not seem to have any problems. But the screen turned yellow and the buttons went inside the body. I got it refunded and bought a note 3 neo. I am really happy with the note experience. And the battery for me pasts one and a half days and best of all it has no problems.",

I processed this order when i was traveling i ordered this phone for my uncle & by mistake i had but his incomplete mobile number 09890581865, i forgot the last digit 5 to enter while placing the order, Now the delivery was expected by the 1st Jan, Now today when i checked my email i got a mail from flipkart that my order was cancelled without me being aware of it & i spoke to Pranay, Sunil Alok & everyone easily hung up the phone on me. Sunil being a manager hung up that was strange. They said they couldn't help & i will have to replace the fresh order & the same offer is no longer available. Now as a customer try and understand how i would feel agreed that the mobile number was incorrect but the email ID was correct an email could have been sent that \"please contact us in 48hrs or 72hrs since we are not able to get in touch with you due to your incorrect mobile number & i you don't contact your order will be cancelled\". Rather than directly cancelling my order. Now my request was to help me place the same order again as a human error of typing can always be there & i as a customer had already made the payment & had never asked for the order to be cancelled. Hope somebody considers this mistake & helps me because as of now my perception is Flipkart does not requires customers and thinks only they sell mobile phones. But any company should always think the are there because of the customers.",

The product : Pluses Good call quality & nice speakers Decent camera for outdoors Doesnt crash or freeze as my Lumia used to. Battery life of ~20 hrs with calls of 30-45 min, wi-fi on 10 hrs, rest on 3G, social media usage, email checking & game playing of maybe 20 min Useful apps out of the box Minuses Camera for indoor/low light photos Screen shows blotchy reds and faded blues GPS first fix takes a very long time ~6-8 min (a big minus for me) Charging time is high at ~4 hrs. But at this price, I'd buy it again, not the brilliant Zenfone 5, which is as good/better in some areas, except 2 - I found Moto G a bit easier to hold and use singlehandedly, the battery life is better than Asus, with the better screen being Asus USP over Moto G. Now about FK. I was a bit disappointed to wait for 8 days for delivery, as the status messages showed the phone was stuck in transit for the most part. To be fair, FK did say 10-12 days at the time of the order, however I suppose I've gotton used to FK's superfast delivery. Still FK's customer service was good as always, on pointing out the delay, they got the delivery expedited.",

Even the Motorola don't have their exclusive service centers in India, the service center they are having are on contract basis who are working for multiple companies simultaneously.

If you usually use phone for navigation, like me then make sure to carry a powerbank with you.

Pros: 1) Great display you would love it at this price. 2) Multitasking much easier. 3) picture quality of camera is good front(2mp) as well back(8mp). 4) sound quality of call is great. 5) Built in quality and Hardware is great. Cons: 1) Battery backup is real issue like any smart phone,, It can allow you to run 24 hours backup for medium user for heavy user battery die in 12 hours max. and in case of wifi user it will give poor battery performance. 2) some times difficult to judge which one is upside and downside as both side looks same. 3) Hands free given with the phone is not up to the mark. So, overall i rate this device definitely pick. At this price range it is difficult to find such great device in market. I hope you like my review. Thank you",

I have read about other people having the same problem. Is moto not going to do anything about this? How many times do we get out product replaced and take back-ups and transfer our data. Very very disappointed with the call quality. The sound on earpiece was buzzing/crackling, was really annoying because it happens in every call, regardless the phone number. Have tried changing my sim to other phones. There was no problem with those phones. No issues with flipkart though. I would not recommend buying this handset.",

Having quite decent specs and camera and of course the latest android updates(Lollipop 5.0) it's one of the best cell phones I've used till date. There's no lag(even while loading heavy games like FIFA 15 or Ashphalt 8) and all my apps run smoothly. The battery life is great and lasts upto a day on heavy usage. Initially the battery will take upto 6 hours to charge but after a few days it won't take much time and PLEASE DO NOT THE MOTOROLA CHARGER, use some other charger of samsung or sony because the phone will get charged quickly.",

            "comment": "I switched from windows phone (lumia 820). Obviously there are many nice things to like here. Android OS, customizability, ROMs and what not. I heard good things about moto series and am not at all disappointed by the device. The construction is of good quality not unlike the Nokia phones. Device is appropriately thin and light but it's not setting records in either category. At 13k, it's probably not meant to. Coming to the performance, I am pleasantly surprised at how far android has come since I left it (2.2 froyo) in search of smoother experience (hence the WP). It's not that the device doesn't stutters. It does. But they are not in general animations and transitions. Maybe if I am running too many apps and want to switch from google play to camera. It's only 1GB after all. Otherwise, the feeling of stock android is pretty great and if used well, this phone keeps things smooth. And this is someone coming from WP which is a damn smooth system even on lowly 530. So I know what actually good performance feels like (820 is not the fastest phone out there but it's no slouch either). Moreover, the upcoming Lollipop update should help sweeten the deal even further. I plan on unlocking the bootloader soon and getting into flashing roms. Just waiting for at least one OTA to make its way onto a pristine system. I dont' use the camera much. I think it'll do well in good lighting conditions but I don't expect too many low light shots to shine through. That's all from a couple of shots I did take just to check out the app. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and can easily recommend this phone.",

Cons: * Battery Backup is not good(Requires 2 to 3 recharges a day if connected to 3G/2G all day plus games for 1 hr and browsing 30mins and location sevices for 1 hour) and battery one percentage drops every 10 to 15 mins, * Motorola should atleast give 3200mAh Battery for all the Moto E,G,X series. * Front cam is not impressive if you take a lot of selfies. And Camera app is Buggy. * Very low quality headsets(Worth just 50rs/- or maximum 100rs/-. Bought skullcandy and its great. so another extra 500 bucks you may have to spend if you are a serious music junkie like me). * Charger is overheating while charging but the phone stays cool(No probs for me). * Price a little Higher(2000 may be) considering the processor and graphics card and chipset same as MOTO E. * Almost doubled the price of MOTO E for just camera and bigger display? What else is the change every other things are just the same. Original Accessories are costly. Delivery: Happy with the delivery and the package.",

After the 60days of using the mobile, I got an issue, it happened suddenly, it turned off automatically, I charged it for an hour and tried to turn it on. It just kept showing the moto logo and no further response, I did all the basic troubleshooting from my side. I am even ready to do the factory reset. No use, it just kept displaying the logo. I reached out the service center on 14th Dec, they are not ready to do the basic trouble shoot, they just got the mobile and gave me some work out Num. and told the mobile will be ready in 7 days. I called the service center again in 3 days, to know the status. They told like they are waiting for Parts to come from moto. I gone weird, on further questions they told like the 'Mother Board gone busted' and they have requested for the replacement of mother board to moto, and they are waiting for the parts to arrive. 1 - How come a 60days mobile get trouble with Mother Board. 2 - How come the service persons request for replacement of mother board, without my permission. Customer Service, the another Hell which i entered into. Worst ever Customer Care service. - They told there is no replacement after 30 days, even if the mother board is got busted - One of the service person said, his moto g also got busted and questioning myself what can we do. - They agree that Moto g 2nd is facing the mother board issue for many customers. - NO ONE is ready to talk about the replacement. In due after 7 days I called to check whether they at least replaced the parts Another shocking from the service center, they told as it was moto g2nd they may another 4 days to dispatch the parts from moto side. Again I reached Moto Customer Service, A lady picked and told that she has escalated the issue and will be getting call in 24 hrs. - No response in 24 hrs, when I reached the moto again, they told there is no such a escalation at all. - am being fooled by the service persons again and again. - One guy said, i must call at the where Service Center is open and they will have the conference call to give the solution, ( i dont why they cant do in offline without me) Now, they agreed to give me a solution in another 48 hrs, that is too over, i didnt get back any calls yet The SLA of the issue is 7 days, but even after 12 days, they are not ready to give a compormising response - I will still going to reach out them. - Mother Board getting busted in 60days is not at all a good mobile - Motorola is not ready to replace the device as it was more than 30 days, another irritating service - No one ready to give you any proper response or ready to take responsible for our escalation. WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! NEVER GO TO MOTOROLA.",

There is no issues of heating or lag in this phone, after a week of continuous usage. The best part is we get an option of expandable memory along with 16GB of internal storage. The parts used in manufacturing of this phone are of top standards.",

But then on 20th december 2014 (that is less thn 3 months from date of purchase), my device would just not turn on. Online chat support was fairly impressive but not really helpful. There are VERY FEW privately owned authorised service centres for motorola. Here's my story: When i finally reached the service centre (in thane, Mumbai), I was informed that I had to wait for at least 90 minutes before my problem would be heard. THE AUTHORISED SERVICE CENTRE ALSO ACCEPTS XAIOMI, BLACKBERRY, HTC and one more brand i cannot recollect. And for all of these, it has just 1 counter. I came to know of a BB customer who waited for over 3 hours for his turn. Finally when it was my turn, this was what was told to me: ANY SOFTWARE PROBLEM WILL TAKE MINIMUM 3 DAYS, AND ANY HARDWARE PROBLEM WILL TAKE ATLEAST 10-15 DAYS. This was a standardized statement for all customers. Bottom-line- You CANNOT expect quick, easily or accessible after sales service. Even though I have been a motorola fan, I'm beginning to question its reliability after listening to so many experiences and experiencing trouble myself.",

Powerful dual speakers 4. Decent photos from the 8MP camera 5. Good battery life Overall I am not disappointed by this second purchase from Motorola.

The only difficulty i felt after working with SAMSUNG phones is 1. There can be an option for put the phone in silent, vibration in notification bar (quickly as in samsung phones) 2. Turning on GPS and mobile data can be made available in the notification bar easily as in samsung with one click rather than again going to settings. BUT overall the phone is the best budget phone.",

Speaker was very loud even without loud speaker ON ( (got in resolved from service center - it took 12 days) 3. All my callers are hearing an eco of their voice when speaking (definitely not a network issue as I am not facing any problem with same sim in other hand set). All Factory resetting done, nothing works every 10 days a new problem.",

FlipKart had a long delivery time (probably due to Diwali rush), but I got it on the promised delivery date. Its a good robust phone - unlike a samsung or carbon which I owned earlier. Bigger screen size compared to prev generation helps. Battery is okay. It doesn't produce great photos - but they are good enough to share on whatsapp. I usually rely on my sony camera for any serious photography. In summary, definitely recommend Moto G for anyone looking for sub 25K phone.",

I am writing this review after using it for more than 2.5 months (83 days to be exact). Pros: 1.Camera: a)Front Camera-This is the best thing about this phone.The 8 m.p camera works better than 12 m.p camera of other Indian brands like Micromax etc. The HDR mode is best for snaps. Personal Suggestion- Download and Use Google camera app instead of inbuilt camera app. As Google camera app supports various modes for camera like Photo sphere, Paranoma, Lens blur and better HDR mode. Front camera- 2 m.p.It is also good for taking selfies. Believe me images come pretty good more than expected. 2.Display- A 5 inch display. it depends on person to person . I like 5 inch display rather than 4.5 inch diplay on old Moto g. The diplay is bright and good. And come on friends who notices ppi with naked eye. 3. Dual Stereo Speakers- Good for watching movies and playing games and are loud enough. And as both speakers are on front side so u don't need to worry about placing phone upside down n all on table or bed so that speakers don't get blocked. 4. Software- Pure Android experience and getting updates time to time #Lollipop coming soon. After Nexus devices Motorola is the 2nd company to get updates. Note- Don't think that after Lenevo- Motorola Deal there will be any effect on updates. Google has sold only hardware unit and not all the patents n all. And even Nexus 6 hardware is by Motorola. 5. Price- At least if i compare it with brands like Samsung's, LG, Nokia,etc it is best value foe money phone. Cons: 1. Less Ram 1 GB- Lags some time and apps crash sometime.(1.5 GB or 2 GB ram would be sufficient ). 2. Design- Dust may enter through gap between the Dual Stereo Speakers and most people don't like than design and want their phone to be fully flat and covered on front. 3.Feels bulky and bigger in hands when compared to other slim 5 inch phones. Now regarding Battery backup I can't place it neither as a pro nor as a con. It is neither best nor bad. It is better than other phones in range and average user may sometimes get more than a day. Note- File manager and audio recorder etc are not available. But it is not an issue you can download from play store for free . Last But not least- Flipkart Service at its best as always. Thanks. Merry Christmas",

Very nice sound.Sound experience is superb. Phone gets headed.Heats very rarely in normal use Pure Android (4.4.4) (ALSO GUARANTEED UPGRADE TO ANDROID LOLLIPOP 5.0) No File Manager installed (You need to download ES File Explorer from Play Store) Go to Settings>>About Phone and tap 5 times on Build number to enable developer mode. 2) PROCESSOR: Moto G Runs on 1.2 GHZ SnapDragon ARM based Processor, On the other hand ASUS runs on 1.6 GHZ Intel x86 based processor. The point here is most of the (99%)android apps are designed to run on an ARM based cpu. Expandable memory - Additional advantage Moto G(1st gen) with the screen size of 4.5 inch had 2070 mah, which was the one of the drawbacks of the phone. Atleast now they should have used 2500 mah battery for the 5inch new moto G(2nd gen) , but they have used the same 2070 mah battery. Performance is also very good Well Design and accurate Delivery by flip kart Headphone sound was average.HD Recording is good and camera is effective on dark room (no light) at 3.5 meter only and picture is good on Mobile flash light.Headphone wired is not too good.File Manager not found on 4.4.4 kitkat Battery(2070mh) performance is good if it is mixed use. 22hrs guaranty.brilliant 5 inch IPS display which produce very high quality images and vides with 720P. 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Processor which allows you for multitasking.",

The device worked well for 3 months until 14.12 when it started refusing to boot-up. Took the phone to the Motorola authorized support expert where the device was detected with motherboard problem. On 16.12, I had filed a formal complaint with Motorola (via email) for which I received an email back from Motorola saying \"Your question has been received. You should expect a response from us within 24 hours.\". Today, it is 23.12. Haven't heard from them yet, despite several reminders in between. When I bought this phone, a lot of my friends suggested not to go with Motorola. I am realizing that they were right. Do they have any service/support at-all? Or only sales? Do they realize that somebody is suffering because of their disgusting product and service. At the moment, it is not going anywhere. Anybody faced similar problem? Any way out?",

There is no lag of the applications and medias. If you are looking for a phone under the budget of 15 K, I would suggest to go for this. Few negative points i have noticed are - Charging speed is slow - Camera is average, but again in this budget it is good",

Build Quality - 8/10 ( The volume and power buttons are flimsy ) Looks - 10/10 ( Surely the best looking phone at this price range ) Display - 7/10 (Display is sharp and bright, still can't match up to Sony's) Sound - 10/10 (Might sound funny, but the speakers are loud enough to put my laptop's onboard speakers to shame) Call quality - 7/10 ( Maybe BSNL to blame, but call quality is not up to my expectations) UI - 9/10 (Vanilla Android) Camera - 7/10 ( The default camera app needs improvement. Google camera gives superb results) Battery - 6/10 (Battery back up is good, but I'd rather have a higher capacity battery) I opted for this phone over Zenphone 5 because of stock android. Zenphone has a nice UI, but it becomes a burden after a few months. With stock android you have the option to customize it your own way. PLEASE NOTE - The charger will charge your phone slowly so as to prevent the battery from over-heating. You may get a charger with higher mAh rating, but it might spoil your battery within a year.",

CPU speed. Yes, this is a budget phone but I found Redmi 1S is way faster than this phone. The phone does lag. Dont believe anyone who says it doesnt. I have used a higher end phone also and this is slow and it shows. But, not very slow. On a whole, its a very decent phone. But, Redmi 1S is better and is only half the price of this one. The only reason I bought this was hoping that AOSP would be very fast. Unfortunately, it wasnt upto my expectations.",

The performance is beyond expectation , battery life is decent , solid design with a gorgeous look, the front facing speakers adding to the beauty..the 8MP rear shooter shoots great pics..no issue of heating or lagging yet ..inclusion of microsd slot and dual sims will make this a perfect phone for those who are planning to buy one.. I got this phone 2 weeks ago and till now i have no complain..flipkarts service was great again delivering the item on time....at 13K we are getting a good smartphone with a promise of getting software updates in the long run...in short its a value for money.. thanks motorola for this awesome device..",

The phone is good however there are two main things that I never expected from Moto atleast. 1. Camera does not seem to be 8MP. Pictures are good for online sharing; not great for printing. 2. Battery is average. It barely touches 10 to 12 hours considering this is a multimedia enabled phone. Battery could have been better. If you watch movies or listen to songs , the battery dies in less than 10 hrs. Recommendation : If you travel a lot, better buy a battery bank or buy some other phone",

I then handed over this phone to the Motorola Service Centre in Bhubaneswar (that also happens to be the service centre of Karbonn, Micromax, Alcatel etc) on 28th November,2014. They by the way are the most dumb people I have ever come across, I find government officials to be more responsible then these servicing people. I am still waiting to get my phone repaired/replaced. I went to the customer service center at least 10 times without any success. The worst part is that I called Motorola on their toll free no. and explained the issue, and they are saying the Parts for this phone are not available in India! And they seem to have escalated the issue and told me I would get a call from the \"Actual Service Officials\" within the next 24 hours. But they 24 hours wait has now turned into 240 Hours wait. I would strongly suggest users not to buy this phone. Only good specifications doesn't buy you a Customer Motorola, effective after sales service is also important.

It has a 8MP primary camera and 2MP secondary camera which is far better, when compared with its predecessor. My views Pros:- *The battery life, which is the most important aspect is pretty good. *Better gaming experiences than the old version due to larger display. *The phone does not hang at all as against the other Low Cost phones which have flooded the market. *The photo quality is excellent. *The flash works amazingly during low light. *I have seen people losing their cool, as half of a mobile's feature is nullified because of low internal memory. This mobile obviously doesn't give you a reason to crib on those grounds. Cons;- *The sound quality could have been better. *The phone could have been slimmer. *SAR value seems to be a big deterrent.When compared with Samsung devices the figures seems to high. *Moto should work on reducing the SAR value when they plan the next version. The phone is good, and that is the reason everyone is talking about it.",

Clear conference voice and signal quality No call drop No hitting even hours and hours use I can't list out here all features here because I am collecting the features of MOto g2 by using it. There are some lack also like Battery is not superb Earphone headset is not of best quality. Not volume control in headset. No music change control in headset Headset speaker is not so fitted with ear initially. You will have to be used to. Sound support stereo no mono.

The camera quality is great front facing is also not bad, works excellent in day light. The ram should have been 1.5GB for more smooth multitasking,but looking at the price you cant really complaint. 16GB memory brings everything in your hand and this one has a OTG(On The Go) support too. As said by the moto they will be providing 5.0 update to this device as early as possible. Interface is almost pure android. Though it has a gorilla glass 3 i have noticed some scratches on the screen so please ensure that you put on a screen guard as early as possible. The stereo speakers are lound but sound cracks sometimes mostly when you play a song with heavy bass. The battery life is average about 7-8 hours of moderate usage and about 4-5 hours of heavy usage.(If the connection is 3G) Overall a very good phone by moto and in budget. Go for it!",

A good budget phone( good for people who change their phones very often) 2. Build Quality: Not that great. The phone kinda feels cheap and when it falls down, there are gonna be dents. So be careful. Dont make it fall or something :P 3. Display: Really good. 720p videos look awesome. Screen brightness under the sun is less could have been a bit more bright. 4. Performance: 1 gb ram. Initially, was a bit doubtful about it but trust me its a beast. I have nfs, real racing, asfalt 8 and rarely lags. Very rare. There is no doubt on performance for the price. I give it a 5 star. 5. Camera: Decent enough. Flash is good, HDR works well. 6: Battery life: Very bad. If you are a heavy user it wont even last for a day and for a moderate user it will last for day. 7. Gets heated up sometimes. 8. Sound quality is ohk not that great. This phone is well suited for people who want good performance at an affordable rate. If you are looking for good battery life not a good option but for the price its a beast. I personally felt the build quality could have been better and battery also. Rest everything is good.",

Except for very few low rated reviews on flipkart. Unfortunately, I ignored these reviews thinking they were one-off cases and ordered the phone. Now, the 1st phone I got; 3G wasn't working and there was a buzzing sound coming from the earpiece during calls. I got it replaced. The 2nd phone had the same buzzing sound problem, but this time it was LOUD. So I got curious as how can 2 random phones could have the same defect. So I checked my friends' phones (around 3-4 moto g 2s) ALL HAD THE SAME PROBLEM! Just that the buzzing was very faint, but when I pointed it out, everyone could predominantly hear the buzzing sound. I requested for a replacement. The 3rd phone had the same problem, however the buzzing was very faint. Also, now the main speakers sound warped when I play songs with a lot of treble. I believe the people who complained about the speaker now. It is present in all the phones. I cannot believe that motorola is selling such crap now that they have established a decent enough market share in India. N many thanks to flipkart for giving me 3 replacements, just unfortunate that the product itself is a fail.",

I also purchased MOTO G Ist Gen for 13999 and I now feel really having been duped into buying that 1st Gen crap. When devices like Mi3 got into our hands for same price as MOTO G 1st, it was a huge letdown for those who purchased 1st Gen, MotoG. That said, this is a decent device with middle ranking specifications and a camera that's just ok for casual photography. Nothing to boast about. The screen size is a good advancement over the previous iteration. But even at 12999, this is, in my opinion, a tad on the higher side of pricing. Now that we have Redmi1s & Mi3 as price reference, I believe that this a highly overpriced gadget. Presently we have many options in this price range where we can get better phones at lesser price points. If one can live with \"late\" updates, Huawei Honor at 6999 is a better option.",

CALL QUALITY TOP NOTCH WITH NOISE CANCELLING 3. PURE KITKAT WITH GUARANTEED \" L \" UPGRADE. 4. LOW LIGHT PICTURES IN CAMERA EXTEREMLY GOOD. 5. LAST BUT NOT LEAST - SOLID BUILD QUALITY. 6. EXPANDABLE MEMORY. OK'S 1.SCREEN PPI AND COLOR VIVIDNESS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. 2. CAMERA NOT THAT TOP NOTCH BUT NOT COMPLAINABLE.-GOOD FOR THIS PRICE RANGE 3. FRONT SPEAKERS- MANY PEOPLE PRAISE ABOUT THE FRONT SPEAKERS , BUT IT REALLY IS NOT THAT LOUD, THIS IS MY 5 TH PHONE IN 3 YEARS AND SO I CAN EASILY FIND THE DIFFERENCE. 4. MUSIC AND SOUND OUTPUT QUALITY NOT GREAT BUT OK, EVEN WITH HEADPHONES. 5. FINGER PRINT MAGNET BACK COVER. 6. BACK PANEL LITTLE SLIPPERY. 7. FOR SOME HIGH END GAMES PROCESSOR HAS SOME LAG. 8. COULD HAVE DONE WITH A BETTER CUSTOMIZED UI , STOCK ANDROID (EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST KITKAT) FEELS VERY CHEAP AND NOTHING SPECIAL. BUT THIS CAN BE OVERCOME BY PURCHASING EVERYTHING ME LAUNCHER OR THEMER APP WHICH IS THE GREATEST IN UI CUSTOMIZATION HOME REPLACEMENT AVAILABLE TODAY IN ANDROID STORE. CON'S 1. THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS IN IN DEFAULT WITHOUT BRIGHTENING IS TOO TOO LOW , EVEN FOR INDOORS IN A HALF LIT ROOM. JUST INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS BY ONE POINT AND EVERY THING IS FINE. 2. NO DLNA AND NFC. 3. NOT A VERY GOOD AUDIO CODEC. 4. LAST BUT NOT LEAST , BULL SHIT EAR PHONES, COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITH JBL IN EARS. SUGGESTIONS: 1. COULD HAVE DONE WITH AN MORE GRIPPIER BACK PANEL. 2. A BETTER HEADPHONES. 3. COMPLETELY CLOSED FRONT DUAL SPEAKER VALLEYS. IF YOU KEEP THE PHONE DIRECTLY UNDER A LIGHT AND LOOK AT THE EDGE OF THE SPEAKERS YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND THE BOTTOM FROM WHERE THE SPEAKER EMERGES, NOW THIS SMALL GAP CAN BE PRONE TO DUST AND SWEAT WHICH CAN GO INSIDE. 4. USB PLUG-GABLE CHARGING PLUG. 5.3000 MAH BATTERY. THATS IT, FINALLY IT IS A GOOD PHONE, EVERY THING HAS ITS PROS AND CONS, WELL YOU CANT EXPECT GALAXY S5 ALPHA FEATURES AND SELL FOR 13 K, BUT WORLDS FIRST MOBILE PHONE MANUFACTURER AND POWERFULL ANDROID MAKES DEADLY COMBINATION, THERE ARE PHONES LIKE KARBONN, ALCATEL, XIAOMI M1 WHICH MAY HAVE DOUBLE SPECS AND SELL AT THE SAME RATE OR SLIGHTLY HIGHER. BUT CANNOT BE COUNTED FOR ENDURANCE. BECAUSE MY 4 YEAR OLD MOTOROLA ATRIX 4G STILL SMOKES SOME OF TODAY'S NEW AND GOOD PHONES FROM TOP MAJOR INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURERS IN ALMOST EVERY RESPECT.

While placing the order, the offers kept changing every second, and finally the product went out of stock ! Finally, I had to place my order like i was catching a Shatabdi Delivery of Product : I ordered the product and was given an estimate of Dec 16 for delivery. I received it on Dec 12. 5 stars for delivery and package quality. The Product itself: I had checked the technical configuration and found it to be pretty good at this price range. saw useful comparisons with LG 90, but looking at the number of pieces sold, i went for Moto G. The appearance of the phone is very classy, the white color gleams out. Battery backup is pretty good with average calls, gaming and net surfing. I believe it could last more than 2 days if not fiddled much. I did experience some heating while playing Gunship battle around the camera lens. The Andriod version takes some time to get used to after you have used a Samsung. Camera quality is quite good, I did see some concerns for the Moto E camera, but now im fine. The size is as large as Nexus and takes a day to get acquainted to after you've used a 4 inch screen. If you have the above 10 budget, you can go for it. Thanks",

Good to have removable back shell atleast, so that we can use different coloured back shells Only dropout I felt badly with this mobile is battery backup. It is draing too fast. I hope lollipop update will helpout in this matter. Definetly if u r is travelling out of staton, one should carry backup battery for sure.

After few days the phone experienced some problem with not getting switched so i took to their authorized service dealers in pune. The experience has been horrendous since then, their service centers are shared by many multi brands and they have highly non-professionals at their service center. They committed that they will give an estimate and solution to the problem within 2 days but there hasn't been any communication after 2 days so i spoke to their service center and they claimed they will take another 7 days to give me an estimate and when i insisted that i need it urgently they replied in an irritating manner to contact motorola. The customer care of mototrola also is not equipped enough with info and they hung me up for around 30 mins to finally escalate the matter further. The matter will take another 2 days and till then i am clueless what this company is doing for its customer. The service level is below pathetic than any brand in todays market and i fail to understand how can a mobile take 7 days to identify the problem. Motorola is not recommended for its after service after the experince that i have went through and i was planning to buy for my mom but now i wont even recommend at all for their service standard. I request flipkart and its users to discontinue using moto phones till they resolve their service standards. Pathetic! Disgusting! Non-professional",

Mere holding it in hand gives you a feeling that it is superb. Though I haven\u2019t started using it in full swing, on start up I found some unerasable/unscrachable/unremovable logo marks (specifically battery & back cover logos).

I visited www.airtellive.com/offers using on mobile phone after enabling data network and I got the following message \"No offer exists for this device\". I immediately called up FlipKart customer care and they told me that this is not their responsibility and I have to contact airtel for the resolution. I contacted airtel but there has been no response from them. I have wasted so much time and money while moving here and there from flipkart and airtel and so on. At least flipkart can ensure if the offer by Airtel in genuine or not. Either this is mis-selling attempt by Flipkart for selling their phone or they have send me the second hand phone where the airtel might have disconnected the offer after giving one. There is definitely something wrong. I am user of Flipkart since last 5 years and never face such fraud in these years.",

On exchange I got a working model the 2nd time only when I realized that the first one delivered by flipkart was probably a used one because it had a clear screen guard already on it which I thought was the usual protective one received from the manufacturer. But the new one's screen protector had specs printed all over it. I am pretty sure the first one delivered was a returned item (probably from someone who had found the same ringtone issues and returned) which gives me a bad feeling about Flipkart that they are trying to shove the defective pieces again onto other buyers thinking that someone would at least quietly keep them !

AnTuTu Benchmark score is approx. 18k even while testing, it was crashing like anything. Many apps just crash in between a using it and make device unstable. Its just value for money phone, just use it as a normal smartphone with limited use of apps. Dont expect much. It is good to view videos. Overall it is 6.5/10 based on my experience.",

Pros include latest OS which WILL be updated to Android L or Lollipop, and the almost stock android experience is really nice. 16gb internal and the sd card slot makes the phone a really good option for people who carry heavy amount of music, videos and movies. Lastly, had the ram been 1.5 gb, it would have added a couple of more thousands but the phone would have been legendary. ;)",

Battery power management in the OS is also not good. I saw many times message that application stooped working and later they start. It looks like they are crashing. There are lot of scope to improve the user experience and the Operating system.",
