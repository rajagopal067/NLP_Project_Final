POS it gets so hot that you canst even touch it.
NEG i will have to think twice before ordering any product on sale through flipkart.the phone screen gets heated in 5-10mins and its very difficult to even talk continuously for 5 mind.
NEG the 5'' screen is good not very big easy to handle.very light and slim feels good in your hand.as battery back up reduces with increase screen size.but over all decent.
NEG the fact that i call it incremental is because they have increased the screen size which decreases the fixed density , upgrade the camera from 5 and 1.3 to 8 and imp respectively added the sd card slot and yes of course it ships with mitka 4.4.4.screen the 720p screen stretched over 5 inches never lets you feel that the fixed density has suffered in my view though it is an ips display with morning gorilla glass 3 on it but it looks and feels just like an amoled.battery even with moderate to low usage this phone struggles to keep pace and ave battery time would be around 8 his with low usage and 5-6 with moderate usage with screen brightness set at auto 2.
NEG also adjust the screen brightness when your outdoor and indoors.sometimes the auto brightness indoors is quite bright and you dont require so much brightness indoors.the only thing better is the camera and the screen size.
POS the lcd display does a very very very god job.the camera is also nice but could have been better.the storage is also very good all in all a very good phone in this range.
POS configuration you can read in product description what i would say very good build very good touch sensitivity good camera automatic upgrade to andros lollipop.good sound quality screen is good took.
