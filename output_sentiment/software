NEG while i was downloading the update it stopped at 290 os due to lost internet connection.when internet connection was up again i tried to download update again from 290 os but it didn start.i canceled the download and checked for system update in settings->about phone again but it shows your software is up to date.
POS and the camera quality os good.
NEG have been using for over 3 months till now no issues like hanging or heating as such other than battery running out soon when using os network but that just andros & moto's way of telling you keep your charger close by phone comes loaded with most of the features which are generally abundant in all other bands so not much to tell camera is decent so is the dual sterno speakers they are loud but who plays music on mobile phone speakers other than plug the headphones.now a full charge lasts max 5-8 hour with just music listening & minor surging on os & whatsapp & ff chat apply.earlier it would last at least 16 hours upbraiding to lollipop has sure made the ui look much cooper but the battery life is something to be wondered about motorola should look into it asap.
NEG not os expected.minus point os 1.battery dies os half day.
NEG os my old phone was lost so deliberately i need a phone.
NEG wifi hotspot os internet speed around 50-60 kbps.
NEG extremely good looks.1 os ram doesn makes u feel dumb.
POS am using moto os since from one months.but only one problem in this one is this mobile is wont support for direct os calling from him and this is the only drawback of this mobile.if you want to make os video calling you need to make through apps.battery back is about oh without using of os chats light weight looking smart in hands and technically it is good with 12, 999 prices.
