Although the phone is good,the screen is too fragile,it broke completely after I dropped it from a pocket height and moreover motorola is reluctant to replace it in warranty.Unsatisfied with the services and build quality.

This is the best choice in this price range.
Main reason to chose Moto G is for battery backup.
Even though Zenphone has 2gb ram under 10000 price tag, It lacks in battery backup.
I have been using this for the past 2 weeks.
Overall satisfied with the performance as well as camera quality.
It has big 5 inch screen with superb build quality and design.
Much satisfied with the battery.

I was very happy with the product i bought it 3 months back.
Early this month somehow it wasn't booting and i came to know the motherboard has crashed.
Luckily in warranty period, I got the motherboard replaced.
just 3 days back i got my phone back and here now i am writing this review!
The primary camera is not working properly.
Its giving blurred images.
Some issue with the auto focus.
I spoke to Motorola customer support, the personel suggested me to do factory reset.
I had to do the whole procedure again.
And i am again back to the square one.
Once again i spoke to the moto customer care, they asked me to take it to the service centre.
Why do i have to make rounds of the service centre every now and then.
It was woking properly before giving for servicing, I find here that these are some workmen whom motorola has given authority and they are not exclusively for Motorola.
I DON'T TRUST TO GIVE MY PHONE TO THESE SERVICE CENTRES AGAIN.
But i am left with no option.
Somehow i could claim for my money back.
and I wish I knew this before.

A great mobile phone by Motorola and on top of it, awesome service by Flipkart.
The estimated delivery time was 31st December but I recieved it on 27th itself.
Talking about the phone, the phone is a genuinely good piece by Motorola having all the essential specs and great harware, this phone is a must buy if anyone needs a true-value smartphone under 15k.
It capture great photos, have a smooth touch, incredible speed and HD display.
The stereo speakers provide a good sound output.
PROS: Screen Size.
Primary Camera.
Secondary Camera.
Stereo Speakers.
Quad Core Processor.
CONS: Haven't found one till now.

The phone got delivered within 3 days, which is always earlier than the estimated time in my area.
Overall the phone is very good to hold and in perfornance but the one I received had a bright spot near the centre of the screen which was clearly visible on lighter backgrounds.
I asked for replacement of the product but first Flipkart customer service mailed me some troubleshooting steps of fixing dead pixels, but it did not work.
I don't think the spot is due to dead pixels.
After telling them again they accepted the return and scheduled it for delivery till 7th Jan. Thanks to Flipkart for helping me out.
I'm eagerly waiting for the phone and will write a complete review after I receive the final product.

It is veery cool, and very easy to handle it , now a days thise type of mobile substitute for samsung mobiles, moto g 2nd gen is veery cool, it has memory upgraded facility, 1GB ram is veery cool for playing some heavy games, and thise mobile gives rich look.

Tom Pallissery
The phone is impressively sharp for such low cost, and beats most of the mid-range phones I would say.
The only area I found dissapointing was the brightness area.
It is a bit lower than other phones in its price category.
Can't comment on the battery life as of now, but it has gone pretty strong for the past 6 hrs of my moderate usage.
Commenting on flipkart delivery, it was awesome, got it delivered with still 5 days remaining for the due date.
(Wasn't so happy about the packing though.
Protection was meager, but could do with it, no worries) Definite recommendations from my side for both the moto g2 and flipkart.

Fist I have been using micromax canvas 2 A110 for three years, I know what is the bad quality product.
That Phone was bad and slow so I got exchange offer I switched it with this GEM.
I have used Nexus 5, Grand 2 and Grand 1 for two days each.
I think Grand 1 and 2 is no where in competition with this phone.
Battery is same to canvas so I know how to use this new phone but it is almost 24 hr still battery running on Wifi And whatsapp.
I am not heavy user.
but still In office wifi is connected for 8 hrs this phone survived easily.
Screen is vivd 295ppi.
camera is awesome, slow mo 720p is perfect.
Phone is delicate i dont know why but I cant Put my phone even in Pocket :P now buttons for volue lock key are decent.
Now the call quality thing: you have to set the volume to 50% or anyone can listen to your call.
Wifi Signal catching is in good range.
Dual speakers are same if you set on high volume sound will crack but set it on 80% I have used only for 24hr I will update after every one week month and six onths just to help some of my fellas out there who are reading and get confused about what to buy in budget range cause budget is big thing for us. 5 stars fpr phone display,camera.
Used this phone for more more than 10 days it is working well pictures are clear.
battery back up is for more than one day for me( wifi 24 hr even in office and home+low brightness whole time).
head phones are cheap quality but why the charger and headphones are white?
I dont understand the concept.
I already have the skullcandy headphones working well with this device.
I will update after one month.
Till now the best of the best!
Used it for months now I have started using more more brightness and high end gaming with graphics.
All is set for 12 hours ( full time wifi on and 40% screen brightness ) phone is bit slow while switching to apps while playing games.
Battery is kind of drawback but screen resolution pics are amazing.
Will update after month.
18/02/2015 Phone is working well.
Awesome hats off to moto for 5.0.2 update.

I bought this phone on 23rd November and got it on 24th and I was pretty happy about it.
It seemed like a good phone at the moment but then came the problems.
If I would use any type of screengaurd my touch screen would start to act funny.
I hated it.it
was also pretty slow.
I ordered for a replacement and got it within 1 day.
The new one did not seem to have any problems.
But the screen turned yellow and the buttons went inside the body.
I got it refunded and bought a note 3 neo.
I am really happy with the note experience.
And the battery for me pasts one and a half days and best of all it has no problems.

Hi Team, This was the worst experience ever i have had with filpkart, I had processed an order on 23rd Dec for a phone MotoG2, on exchange offer through my mobile application from standard chartered credit card, Order no:-OD201618115386931100.
I processed this order when i was traveling i ordered this phone for my uncle & by mistake i had but his incomplete mobile number 09890581865, i forgot the last digit 5 to enter while placing the order, Now the delivery was expected by the 1st Jan, Now today when i checked my email i got a mail from flipkart that my order was cancelled without me being aware of it & i spoke to Pranay, Sunil Alok & everyone easily hung up the phone on me.
Sunil being a manager hung up that was strange.
They said they couldn't help & i will have to replace the fresh order & the same offer is no longer available.
Now as a customer try and understand how i would feel agreed that the mobile number was incorrect but the email ID was correct an email could have been sent that "please contact us in 48hrs or 72hrs since we are not able to get in touch with you due to your incorrect mobile number & i you don't contact your order will be cancelled".
Rather than directly cancelling my order.
Now my request was to help me place the same order again as a human error of typing can always be there & i as a customer had already made the payment & had never asked for the order to be cancelled.
Hope somebody considers this mistake & helps me because as of now my perception is Flipkart does not requires customers and thinks only they sell mobile phones.
But any company should always think the are there because of the customers.

I've used this phone for the past 3 months now, and reading all the reviews already would only speak of pros & cons for me.
The product : Pluses Good call quality & nice speakers Decent camera for outdoors Doesnt crash or freeze as my Lumia used to.
Battery life of ~20 hrs with calls of 30-45 min, wi-fi on 10 hrs, rest on 3G, social media usage, email checking & game playing of maybe 20 min Useful apps out of the box Minuses Camera for indoor/low light photos Screen shows blotchy reds and faded blues GPS first fix takes a very long time ~6-8 min (a big minus for me) Charging time is high at ~4 hrs.
But at this price, I'd buy it again, not the brilliant Zenfone 5, which is as good/better in some areas, except 2 - I found Moto G a bit easier to hold and use singlehandedly, the battery life is better than Asus, with the better screen being Asus USP over Moto G. Now about FK.
I was a bit disappointed to wait for 8 days for delivery, as the status messages showed the phone was stuck in transit for the most part.
To be fair, FK did say 10-12 days at the time of the order, however I suppose I've gotton used to FK's superfast delivery.
Still FK's customer service was good as always, on pointing out the delay, they got the delivery expedited.

Moto G 2nd Gen not worth.product
quality is worst.
heating issues during call and all application installed via google play gets corrupted and photos stored in SD card gets deleted automatically replaced the product 1 times and finally returned the product to Flipkart.
Please cautious before buying.
Moto E was far better when compared to Moto G 2nd gen.
Camera clarity depends on phone to phone.it was worst in the replace moto g than the earlier one

Previously I owned Moto G 1st Gen. which is the best budget phone of 2013 and now I feel happy and proud to have the Best budget phone of 2014.. Moto G 2nd Gen.
Here are the pros and cons of the phone.
Pros :- The phone is slim and easy to carry The phone has a good battery backup.
The look of the phone is awesome and the curved edges makes easy to handle the phone!!
The speakers are loud enough and gaming experience is awesome....
It is upgradable to the latest Android L "Lollipop" and Motorola claims that it will always provide the latest android to the phone.. Cons :- I have used this phone for Two months and till date I didn't find any problem in the phone.... Description :- The phone is awesome and there were no issues till now when I was using my phone...
I suggest this phone for the gadget geeks and its the best budget phone ever !!!! Kudos to Motorola !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Prompt delivery the next day from Flipkart!
I have been using it since my purchase on the launch date and faced no problems.
Rugged construction.
Survived a fall down the stairs.
Good Specs at a reasonable price.
Good performance in gaming.
Excellent Camera which is a marked improvement over 1st edition which I purchased for my daughter.
Great low light pictures… some better than my Cannon IXUS.
So stopped carrying my camera.
Battery is lasting two days for me which is better than my previous LG L9.
Prefer this over the Chinese ones.

I bought a Motorola Moto G 2nd gen.
phone and as the one month passed i begin to face several issues like hanging, Whatsapp not working properly, and most severe issue was mic was not working properly.
When i contacted FLipkart they refused to take any action as they said one month has passed and acc. to their policy they only return or exchange a product within 30 days, which in my case have passed.
Even the Motorola don't have their exclusive service centers in India, the service center they are having are on contract basis who are working for multiple companies simultaneously.
Thus having a very poor shopping experience.

The phone is very good in terms of specs and performance.
The build quality is really good.
But the battery is really disappointing.
On normal usage it lasts barely a day.
Once I was travelling and was using this phone for GPS navigation, to my surprise battery was empty within few hours.
If you usually use phone for navigation, like me then make sure to carry a powerbank with you.
Another annoying thing I noticed about this phone is that I keep on getting a notice that says "Restricted Access Changed Emergency service is blocked".
this happens every few minutes.
I found that many are having this problem.
I think this may be resolved in the next software update.

I have been using this phone for atleast a month now...
The phone looks exceptionally good!!!!!!!!!!!! BUT.... Dont FALL for it, This is a piece of crap being sold!!
The Android Kitkat 4.4.4 stock is not meant for this phone at ALLLL!!!
The phone hangs a lot..
It is better kept empty as it proves to be a crap as it hangs a lot when it is filled with apps.
The android 5.01 lollipop is just a teaser which has not come to INDIA in months.
So please go select some other mobile as it is unworthy of the HYPE it is creating and created.
I feel the 1st gen was a lot more better than the second gen ........
When rooted it performs a tad better.. but dont get it rooted as it is suicidal.... Dont go for IT!!!!!!!!!!!!

Policy is not the same for Indian customers, outside India they are aware of this issue and are replacing the screen for free but here they are charging over 6k.
I would not recommend it to anyone now.

The only Bad thing was When I watch HD Videos or Videos for more time.
The phone gets Heated Up.
Except that everything was Fine.
Thank You.

Hello readers, I, here first time writing review of any product.
For moto g 2nd i would definitely suggest to buy it.
Really it is product of value for money.
After using 20 days.
I am writing pros and cons of this product.
Pros: 1) Great display you would love it at this price.
2) Multitasking much easier.
3) picture quality of camera is good front(2mp) as well back(8mp).
4) sound quality of call is great.
5) Built in quality and Hardware is great.
Cons: 1) Battery backup is real issue like any smart phone,, It can allow you to run 24 hours backup for medium user for heavy user battery die in 12 hours max.
and in case of wifi user it will give poor battery performance.
2) some times difficult to judge which one is upside and downside as both side looks same.
3) Hands free given with the phone is not up to the mark.
So, overall i rate this device definitely pick.
At this price range it is difficult to find such great device in market.
I hope you like my review.
Thank you

This is good phone, but Weight of mobile is heavy.
can't use it continuously for a hour in hand, as the weight causes pain in hand and more over after 2 months phone starts to get hanged very often

Have used it for over a month, a good budget phone, headphone quality is very bad,and the built quality is not as expected or as it looks, just a single slip from ur hand can give dents and scratches to the plastic outline.

I got it a week ago and fell in love with this mobile Moto g 2nd gen has a better processer and better features... ofcourse upgradable 2 the latest software 2 date.. Much-improved camera Strong battery life Solid, well-built design one of the best of the best phone within 13k wht to say abt it its simply awesome from the house of motorola .. And last but not least flipkart service is simply Aaaawsome.. :)

I got Moto g 2nd gen and got it replaced in a week.
Major issues in hearing as there is a lot of background disturbance.
Very annoying to have a conversation.
I have read about other people having the same problem.
Is moto not going to do anything about this?
How many times do we get out product replaced and take back-ups and transfer our data.
Very very disappointed with the call quality.
The sound on earpiece was buzzing/crackling, was really annoying because it happens in every call, regardless the phone number.
Have tried changing my sim to other phones.
There was no problem with those phones.
No issues with flipkart though.
I would not recommend buying this handset.

This phone does not have the world's best specs or the world's best camera.But , for 13K it gives you, more than enough.
Having quite decent specs and camera and of course the latest android updates(Lollipop 5.0) it's one of the best cell phones I've used till date.
There's no lag(even while loading heavy games like FIFA 15 or Ashphalt 8) and all my apps run smoothly.
The battery life is great and lasts upto a day on heavy usage.
Initially the battery will take upto 6 hours to charge but after a few days it won't take much time and PLEASE DO NOT THE MOTOROLA CHARGER, use some other charger of samsung or sony because the phone will get charged quickly.

I just migrated to the Moto G from being with Nokia for a long time.
I am yet to use all the features fully, before I can qualify to comment (whether good or bad).
But prima-facie, this mobile for the listed features is definitely a good value for Money.
I shall have to wait for few more weeks to check out all the feature, to come full circle before I pass my comments.
Package reached before time and was packed well.
The delivery person was courteous to quickly check the exchanging mobile and delivered this beauty.

I liked the Moto g2 camera.
I used Nexus 4 before, but Moto g2 camera qualit is very good.
Only issue I have seen is with my piece it's not detecting Memory card, which is very crucial.

Akash Agrawal
I switched from windows phone (lumia 820).
Obviously there are many nice things to like here.
Android OS, customizability, ROMs and what not.
I heard good things about moto series and am not at all disappointed by the device.
The construction is of good quality not unlike the Nokia phones.
Device is appropriately thin and light but it's not setting records in either category.
At 13k, it's probably not meant to.
Coming to the performance, I am pleasantly surprised at how far android has come since I left it (2.2 froyo) in search of smoother experience (hence the WP).
It's not that the device doesn't stutters.
It does.
But they are not in general animations and transitions.
Maybe if I am running too many apps and want to switch from google play to camera.
It's only 1GB after all.
Otherwise, the feeling of stock android is pretty great and if used well, this phone keeps things smooth.
And this is someone coming from WP which is a damn smooth system even on lowly 530.
So I know what actually good performance feels like (820 is not the fastest phone out there but it's no slouch either).
Moreover, the upcoming Lollipop update should help sweeten the deal even further.
I plan on unlocking the bootloader soon and getting into flashing roms.
Just waiting for at least one OTA to make its way onto a pristine system.
I dont' use the camera much.
I think it'll do well in good lighting conditions but I don't expect too many low light shots to shine through.
That's all from a couple of shots I did take just to check out the app.
Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and can easily recommend this phone.

Hi m Chetan from Amravati it is a best value smartphone of the year 2014.. i tink ok! overall performance is satisfactory... but Ram and Battery little bit higher wht would happen..! And one thing to be said in right side small corner touch caliber wrong scene, but that is nothing to worry about it.
I've been using it for 3 months now am update lollipop 5.0.2 work as my expected, excellent..! and that calibration problem is gone... Thank u flipkart ...

Manthan Tripathi
Mobile is in not good not bad state, Many things are appraisable, Camera, processor, External SD card support.
Negative things are battery and DPI for screen.
but still good to go.
One thing that make you confused to buy is almost same kind of configuration you can get much cheaper with xiaomi redmi S.
But G2's camera is far more better than its.

Writing this review after well using the product for 2 months.
*Excellent product.
*Value for Money.
*Best Budget Smart Phone PROS: VFM, Features, Durability, Android Stock OS, Better performance, Less Heating, Compatibility, Branding, Gaming.
Cons: * Battery Backup is not good(Requires 2 to 3 recharges a day if connected to 3G/2G all day plus games for 1 hr and browsing 30mins and location sevices for 1 hour) and battery one percentage drops every 10 to 15 mins, * Motorola should atleast give 3200mAh Battery for all the Moto E,G,X series.
* Front cam is not impressive if you take a lot of selfies.
And Camera app is Buggy.
* Very low quality headsets(Worth just 50rs/- or maximum 100rs/-.
Bought skullcandy and its great.
so another extra 500 bucks you may have to spend if you are a serious music junkie like me).
* Charger is overheating while charging but the phone stays cool(No probs for me).
* Price a little Higher(2000 may be) considering the processor and graphics card and chipset same as MOTO E. * Almost doubled the price of MOTO E for just camera and bigger display?
What else is the change every other things are just the same.
Original Accessories are costly.
Delivery: Happy with the delivery and the package.

at the time of buying i have research a lot on micro max canvas nitro, xiomi red me 1s, and every phone which was in competition of this phone, but i trusted only this phone because Motorola is genuine company , and it serves good product from starting, i have given 5 stars because motorola has fulfilled my requirement , i have motoe also.
sound is excellent, not like chinise phone, camera is also very good, bettery life is also very good , in normal use my bettery last for 1.5 day, and also it will come with android 5, so only some of phone has given surety of android 5, motorola is one of them, it is very good phone, go for it, it is my personal experience.

Pros - Well built , fits perfectly in the palm with a good built - Very good battery life - clean efficient OS - good camera even though its an 8 mp - excellent touch and display quality Cons - Voice call quality could do better Overall its a top class phone in this price range, you might get better specs better speed better ram by other brands in this 13k range , but this performs better and is very much stable in OS.
Caution : Unless you are a app junkie who wants to use several apps simultaneously i would highly recommend this phone

As like everyone, I also impressed by the feature of the Moto G 2nd gen.
I got it right on the 1st week of launch.
It was quite good until the day happens.
After the 60days of using the mobile, I got an issue, it happened suddenly, it turned off automatically, I charged it for an hour and tried to turn it on.
It just kept showing the moto logo and no further response, I did all the basic troubleshooting from my side.
I am even ready to do the factory reset.
No use, it just kept displaying the logo.
I reached out the service center on 14th Dec, they are not ready to do the basic trouble shoot, they just got the mobile and gave me some work out Num. and told the mobile will be ready in 7 days.
I called the service center again in 3 days, to know the status.
They told like they are waiting for Parts to come from moto.
I gone weird, on further questions they told like the 'Mother Board gone busted' and they have requested for the replacement of mother board to moto, and they are waiting for the parts to arrive. 1 - How come a 60days mobile get trouble with Mother Board. 2 - How come the service persons request for replacement of mother board, without my permission.
Customer Service, the another Hell which i entered into.
Worst ever Customer Care service.
- They told there is no replacement after 30 days, even if the mother board is got busted - One of the service person said, his moto g also got busted and questioning myself what can we do.
- They agree that Moto g 2nd is facing the mother board issue for many customers.
- NO ONE is ready to talk about the replacement.
In due after 7 days I called to check whether they at least replaced the parts Another shocking from the service center, they told as it was moto g2nd they may another 4 days to dispatch the parts from moto side.
Again I reached Moto Customer Service, A lady picked and told that she has escalated the issue and will be getting call in 24 hrs.
- No response in 24 hrs, when I reached the moto again, they told there is no such a escalation at all. - am being fooled by the service persons again and again.
- One guy said, i must call at the where Service Center is open and they will have the conference call to give the solution, ( i dont why they cant do in offline without me) Now, they agreed to give me a solution in another 48 hrs, that is too over, i didnt get back any calls yet The SLA of the issue is 7 days, but even after 12 days, they are not ready to give a compormising response - I will still going to reach out them. - Mother Board getting busted in 60days is not at all a good mobile - Motorola is not ready to replace the device as it was more than 30 days, another irritating service - No one ready to give you any proper response or ready to take responsible for our escalation.
WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! NEVER GO TO MOTOROLA.

It's hard to find a phone of this quality at this price range.
Motorola lived upto my expectation.

The best part is we get an option of expandable memory along with 16GB of internal storage.
The parts used in manufacturing of this phone are of top standards.

I'd purchased Moto G (2nd gen) from flipkart on 3rd October 2014.
Fairly quick delivery.
Impressedwith the product.
But then on 20th december 2014 (that is less thn 3 months from date of purchase), my device would just not turn on.
Online chat support was fairly impressive but not really helpful.
There are VERY FEW privately owned authorised service centres for motorola.
Here's my story: When i finally reached the service centre (in thane, Mumbai), I was informed that I had to wait for at least 90 minutes before my problem would be heard.
THE AUTHORISED SERVICE CENTRE ALSO ACCEPTS XAIOMI, BLACKBERRY, HTC and one more brand i cannot recollect.
And for all of these, it has just 1 counter.
I came to know of a BB customer who waited for over 3 hours for his turn.
Finally when it was my turn, this was what was told to me: ANY SOFTWARE PROBLEM WILL TAKE MINIMUM 3 DAYS, AND ANY HARDWARE PROBLEM WILL TAKE ATLEAST 10-15 DAYS.
This was a standardized statement for all customers.
Bottom-line- You CANNOT expect quick, easily or accessible after sales service.
Even though I have been a motorola fan, I'm beginning to question its reliability after listening to so many experiences and experiencing trouble myself.

After using samsung for two yrs, it was time for different brand and after lot of pondering i stuck to moto g2, using it for the last twenty days i can say that its simply superb, performance is ultimate,no lag at all, dont worry about ram, in my case i was bit worried but after using it, i felt that its very much compatible with hardware.Coming to the battery life, its not that bad, average users can easily go for a day, while moderate to bit high end user need to charge.Still under 20 k segment, it is the best phone to buy, just go for it.

I already own a Moto G 1st edition and i decided to change the phone since i had to give that to my wife recently.I couldn't decide on any phone other than Moto G2 on this price range.
It has been just 2 days since the purchase.
I may give a detailed review later.
First Impressions: 1. Feels premium 2. Bigger display looks better even with the relatively lower dpi 3. Powerful dual speakers 4. Decent photos from the 8MP camera 5. Good battery life Overall I am not disappointed by this second purchase from Motorola.
It is the most reliable phone comparing to the other phones you may be comparing right now likes of zen phone and Redmi.
Finally, Flipkart service was awesome as usual; delivered the product well before the promised delivery date.

The phone was well packed and the delivery was very quick.
This is my review after working with phone for one week.
I AM VERY DISAAPOINTED WITH THE HEADPHONES, VERY POOR QUALITY AND THE HEADPHONES I RECEIVED IS SHACKING INSIDE THE MIC PART.
BUT the Phone is working excellent and everything is functioning smoothly in phone.
i have been using SAMSUNG series phones for a long time.
The only difficulty i felt after working with SAMSUNG phones is 1.
There can be an option for put the phone in silent, vibration in notification bar (quickly as in samsung phones) 2. Turning on GPS and mobile data can be made available in the notification bar easily as in samsung with one click rather than again going to settings.
BUT overall the phone is the best budget phone.

Well, I was mesmerized at my first look of Moto G 2. But gradually ended up very dissatisfied by the quality of the 2 MP Front Camera.
It is not comparable to Nexus 5, another phone with a 2 MP camera.
My take on MOTO G 2 : Screen Touch : Awesome.
Primary Camera: Great quality.
Secondary Camera: Below par.
Other Features: STOCK ANDROID: Nice.
Google Voice Search.
Upgradable to Android Lollipop.

First of all for Ws Retail did a great job and dispatched the product next day of order but the delivery company Delhivery Prepaid was quite slow and took 5 days to deliver pack to Dehradun which generally takes 2 days.
About the product this is an awesome phone with good screen performance battery backup with full time on WiFi and playing games in between.
Camera quality and sound quality are also very good.
It has been more than a week I am using this phone and it has not hanged up even once.
I have been using Samsung Galaxy S-Advanced before this and was really tired of its hanging and battery problem.
But I am totally satisfied with it.
Best Buy at this cost.

I am using this phone since 2 months and suddenly I found difficulty in charging.
When I call to service center they told me that you have to change PCB and it is not included in the warranty and it cost about half of the mobile phone.
I am using Android phone since 2 years but first time with this phone I found this issue.. Motorola providing hardware with lower quality in higher price range.
And customer support is even worse.
They just want to sell phone that's it not support then after.

No doubt this is the best product under 20K price range.
Amazing screen display and camera.
It's very smooth to operate and gives a very good experience.

I received this mobile on 1st Aug 2014, The mobile was fine until 30~40 days, after that it all started, 1. Mobile screen had got vertical lines (got in replaced from service center - it took 15 days) 2. Speaker was very loud even without loud speaker ON ( (got in resolved from service center - it took 12 days) 3.
All my callers are hearing an eco of their voice when speaking (definitely not a network issue as I am not facing any problem with same sim in other hand set).
All Factory resetting done, nothing works every 10 days a new problem.

The main problem with this device is its battery backup.. Otherwise everything is fine and satisfactory.

Got this device the Next day itself - THANKS TO FLIPKART FIRST SERVICE!
The new Moto G isn't just an amazing bargain.
It's a phone that gives a surprising number of mid-range handsets a real run for their money, and in most cases actually beats them hands down in terms of overall value.
I didn't think it was possible to create a better phone than the original Moto G, but the latest version of Motorola's unstoppable handset rightly claims its crown as the new king of budget smartphones.

I have been using this phone for past couple of months and am happy to have it.
FlipKart had a long delivery time (probably due to Diwali rush), but I got it on the promised delivery date.
Its a good robust phone - unlike a samsung or carbon which I owned earlier.
Bigger screen size compared to prev generation helps.
Battery is okay.
It doesn't produce great photos - but they are good enough to share on whatsapp.
I usually rely on my sony camera for any serious photography.
In summary, definitely recommend Moto G for anyone looking for sub 25K phone.

Ordered a Moto G and found out that call clarity was terrible.
The technical assistance team's suggestions did not work, so I returned the handset.
The second one I got had the same problem, and also its battery was draining at a super fast speed.
Returned the second one as well and do not intend to buy motorola product again.

willn't talk about specs but below are some points to consider before u buy it 1 - good mobile if you are an office guy..good UI exp. as stock android is there.
2 - not worth for hardcore gamers why.?? coz high games like asphalt, have to be played at low resol otherwise even with medium graphics it crashes out, same with other games.
3 - battery is an issue if you play asphalt contentiously it will last to 3-3.5 hrs..i have used other mobiles at 10k segments & they last for 5 hrs below is the battery life while using cont, having battery saving on & with battery doctor : high game like asphalt - 3-3.5 hr, temple run -5 hrs,camera - 4 hr, music - around 4.5 hr, wifi - 4-4.5 hrs, currently i play temple run for 1 hr in a day, 1 hr on call with 2g check whatsapp, gmail & fb check after half an hour each just for 5 min & having dual sim inserted & i get battery backup of around 5 - 5.5 hr 4 - sound (music) is loud but not enough clear still acceptable 5 - good grip, easy to use & good look 6 - some heating prob while using camera & gaming 7 - camera is 8 mp but is awesome.
it looks better than 13 mp in it's segment, proper & clear image but only in day light.
at night it is like 5 mp in it's segment.
front camera is good 8 - take much time to get charged, more than 3 hr from 0 to 100% final words it is a better option if you are not an hard core gamer even after that you have to charge it twice a day.best for an office guy.
I say it 'gareebon ka iphone'.... :) joking.. Hope it will help....

The cell phone is great but they messed up with the Memory management of the android.

AKSHAY
I will directly write the pro's n cons of this device so that its easily helpful for all.
I am writing this review after using it for more than 2.5 months (83 days to be exact).
Pros: 1.Camera: a)Front Camera-This is the best thing about this phone.The 8 m.p camera works better than 12 m.p camera of other Indian brands like Micromax etc.
The HDR mode is best for snaps.
Personal Suggestion- Download and Use Google camera app instead of inbuilt camera app.
As Google camera app supports various modes for camera like Photo sphere, Paranoma, Lens blur and better HDR mode.
Front camera- 2 m.p.It is also good for taking selfies.
Believe me images come pretty good more than expected.
2.Display- A 5 inch display.
it depends on person to person .
I like 5 inch display rather than 4.5 inch diplay on old Moto g.
The diplay is bright and good.
And come on friends who notices ppi with naked eye.
3. Dual Stereo Speakers- Good for watching movies and playing games and are loud enough.
And as both speakers are on front side so u don't need to worry about placing phone upside down n all on table or bed so that speakers don't get blocked.
4. Software- Pure Android experience and getting updates time to time #Lollipop coming soon.
After Nexus devices Motorola is the 2nd company to get updates.
Note- Don't think that after Lenevo- Motorola Deal there will be any effect on updates.
Google has sold only hardware unit and not all the patents n all.
And even Nexus 6 hardware is by Motorola.
5. Price- At least if i compare it with brands like Samsung's, LG, Nokia,etc it is best value foe money phone.
Cons: 1. Less Ram 1 GB- Lags some time and apps crash sometime.(1.5 GB or 2 GB ram would be sufficient ). 2. Design- Dust may enter through gap between the Dual Stereo Speakers and most people don't like than design and want their phone to be fully flat and covered on front.
3.Feels bulky and bigger in hands when compared to other slim 5 inch phones.
Now regarding Battery backup I can't place it neither as a pro nor as a con.
It is neither best nor bad.
It is better than other phones in range and average user may sometimes get more than a day.
Note- File manager and audio recorder etc are not available.
But it is not an issue you can download from play store for free .
Last But not least- Flipkart Service at its best as always.
Thanks.
Merry Christmas

Camera : 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front.
Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors.
2MP - great selfie.Cam clarity is Excellent Sound : The front dual speakers are awesome.
Very nice sound.Sound experience is superb.
Phone gets headed.Heats very rarely in normal use Pure Android (4.4.4) (ALSO GUARANTEED UPGRADE TO ANDROID LOLLIPOP 5.0) No File Manager installed (You need to download ES File Explorer from Play Store) Go to Settings>>About Phone and tap 5 times on Build number to enable developer mode.
2) PROCESSOR: Moto G Runs on 1.2 GHZ SnapDragon ARM based Processor, On the other hand ASUS runs on 1.6 GHZ Intel x86 based processor.
The point here is most of the (99%)android apps are designed to run on an ARM based cpu.
Expandable memory - Additional advantage Moto G(1st gen) with the screen size of 4.5 inch had 2070 mah, which was the one of the drawbacks of the phone.
Atleast now they should have used 2500 mah battery for the 5inch new moto G(2nd gen) , but they have used the same 2070 mah battery.
Performance is also very good Well Design and accurate Delivery by flip kart Headphone sound was average.HD Recording is good and camera is effective on dark room (no light) at 3.5 meter only and picture is good on Mobile flash light.Headphone wired is not too good.File Manager not found on 4.4.4
kitkat Battery(2070mh) performance is good if it is mixed use.
22hrs guaranty.brilliant
5 inch IPS display which produce very high quality images and vides with 720P.
1.2 GHz Qualcomm Processor which allows you for multitasking.

motog2nd is the best smartphone that you get in the price range of 10000-15000.
You will understand it when you compare it with phones like Samsung galaxy grand, sony xperia C,L,M(same price range).
Its exceptional speed,butter smooth touch ,8mpfront&2mp rear camera (pacca clear clarity) ..make this phone unique.
Its front camera of good clarity for taking selfies.
Best phone...go for it (y)

There are some stupid bugs in the phone which is not expected of motorola.For ex: while calling if u want to open keypad it doesn't open in one go u have to press it thrice and then it appears.
Battery is another pain.It takes 4 hrs to get fully charged and drains in 12hrs of medium usage.Apart from the above negatives everything is almost OK but not great.

nyc phone, awesome features, handy, easy to use and its fun to play with.
The only problem is its battery takes almost 4 hours to get charged by its original charger, on the other hand on using galaxy y chargers it takes 2:30 to 3 hours to charge.
I think Motorola should work on there batteries or chargers (do the RCA) and fix it soon.

Hi, I had purchased Moto G, 2nd Gen from Flipkart on 06th of September, 2014.
Flipkart was quick as usual in delivering the product at my door step.
The device worked well for 3 months until 14.12 when it started refusing to boot-up.
Took the phone to the Motorola authorized support expert where the device was detected with motherboard problem.
On 16.12,
I had filed a formal complaint with Motorola (via email) for which I received an email back from Motorola saying "Your question has been received.
You should expect a response from us within 24 hours.".
Today, it is 23.12.
Haven't heard from them yet, despite several reminders in between.
When I bought this phone, a lot of my friends suggested not to go with Motorola.
I am realizing that they were right.
Do they have any service/support at-all?
Or only sales?
Do they realize that somebody is suffering because of their disgusting product and service.
At the moment, it is not going anywhere.
Anybody faced similar problem?
Any way out?

I never used to buy a low range mobile phone until Motorola came into market with Moto G.
I bought the 1st gen Moto G too.
And now buying this after one year is just amazing.
The specs increased are so much great.
The 8MP camera is flawless.
The 2 front speakers are amazing and very useful.
The 5inch screen is also really great.
With Lollipop coming to it.
It seems the best phone at this range.

Slim Light weight Black color looks better than white 1 by considering all things at this price Performance wise and look wise overall quality of Moto g 2nd gen is BEST.... buy bindasss...

plz provide debit card payment offers through any other bank such-as (sbi) also.
because most of us does not have standard chartered bank account.
standard chartered bank have only very less branches through out the state.
particularly in TamilNadu there are only branches in Chennai and Coimbatore.
so other district peoples are unable to avail this offer.
kindly accept this query and avail this offer to us through other banks.

I am writing this review after the use of Moto g for 2 weeks.
This is one of the best android phones in this range.
The real android experience is good, and easy to use.
There is no lag of the applications and medias.
If you are looking for a phone under the budget of 15 K, I would suggest to go for this.
Few negative points i have noticed are - Charging speed is slow - Camera is average, but again in this budget it is good

Do not buy from this seller.
They have sold me the duplicate product which worked fine till one month and after that it is getting even switched on.
I have got it repaired from the service center twice but still problem has not been resolved.

I will definitely take legal action against flipkart for the same and against this particular seller.

Dude many people complain about the battery life & software problem..
But for me I've never faced any battery life & software problems..
This phone is much better then the mediatek devices.. Wherein with heavy use it dies within 1-2 hrs..
This device lasts for 4-6 hrs of heavy usage.. Plus I hardly use it in weekdays so it lasts almost the full day With 3g on..
And charging is only once a day..

Azaz Ahmed
I was using a Sony Xperia U running CM11 which fell and broke.
So after a lot of research, I bought the Moto G 2nd Gen for 11.7k.
Build Quality - 8/10 ( The volume and power buttons are flimsy ) Looks - 10/10 ( Surely the best looking phone at this price range ) Display - 7/10 (Display is sharp and bright, still can't match up to Sony's) Sound - 10/10 (Might sound funny, but the speakers are loud enough to put my laptop's onboard speakers to shame) Call quality - 7/10 ( Maybe BSNL to blame, but call quality is not up to my expectations) UI - 9/10 (Vanilla Android) Camera - 7/10 ( The default camera app needs improvement.
Google camera gives superb results) Battery - 6/10 (Battery back up is good, but I'd rather have a higher capacity battery) I opted for this phone over Zenphone 5 because of stock android.
Zenphone has a nice UI, but it becomes a burden after a few months.
With stock android you have the option to customize it your own way.
PLEASE NOTE - The charger will charge your phone slowly so as to prevent the battery from over-heating.
You may get a charger with higher mAh rating, but it might spoil your battery within a year.

Decent value for money product with a decent build quality, bright screen and overall performance.

3.5 / 5 Few problems.
Camera.
Its pathetic.
Enough said.
So much noise even when taken in broad daylight.
Only a fool would say that the camera quality is very good.
Its mediocre at best.
Memory.
The launcher crashes quite often when you have lot of apps open / left open.
Especially when you open a relatively big app and close, you will see that launcher crashes.
CPU speed.
Yes, this is a budget phone but I found Redmi 1S is way faster than this phone.
The phone does lag.
Dont believe anyone who says it doesnt.
I have used a higher end phone also and this is slow and it shows.
But, not very slow.
On a whole, its a very decent phone.
But, Redmi 1S is better and is only half the price of this one.
The only reason I bought this was hoping that AOSP would be very fast.
Unfortunately, it wasnt upto my expectations.

Starting it was fine but nowadays it's heating up like anything just playing games, videos or browsing for ten minuets.
I called flipkart after one month 4 days and they said our replacement policy only for 1 month, so go to service center.
And i don't want any part replacement for my new mobile.
Overall product is good but which i received the mobile from flipkart is very bad.

its my first time when i came here to bought something, so its a little bit risky for me to buy a thing like electronics but when i orderd for a moto g 2nd generation i thought may be its little risky but i can manage with that .
so after getting the delivery on very time i am very happy about their delivery skills and my moto g 2nd generation is just too good because its too fast and reliable with extra aided features with in the price bracket of inr 12999.
so i will advise to my friends to buy this latest mid pricy smart phone motorola's design is just suave (handsome,good.smart,intelligents in looks)

the value for money smart phone which should be priced bit less at 9000 to 10000.
rest all is fine with the phone but with increased competition the price should be lessened

Flipkart - Thanks for the quick delivery.

This is my first smartphone and to tell the truth to me its the best budget phone .. The performance is beyond expectation , battery life is decent , solid design with a gorgeous look, the front facing speakers adding to the beauty..the 8MP rear shooter shoots great pics..no issue of heating or lagging yet ..inclusion of microsd slot and dual sims will make this a perfect phone for those who are planning to buy one..
I got this phone 2 weeks ago and till now i have no complain..flipkarts service was great again delivering the item on time....at 13K we are getting a good smartphone with a promise of getting software updates in the long run...in short its a value for money.. thanks motorola for this awesome device..

This is one of the best phones available on Flipkart especially after Xiaomi went off the shelves.

ISOGeek ISO 27...
I gifted this phone to one of my close friends.
I am writing this review after about two months of purchase.
The phone is good however there are two main things that I never expected from Moto atleast.
1. Camera does not seem to be 8MP.
Pictures are good for online sharing; not great for printing.
2. Battery is average.
It barely touches 10 to 12 hours considering this is a multimedia enabled phone.
Battery could have been better.
If you watch movies or listen to songs , the battery dies in less than 10 hrs.
Recommendation : If you travel a lot, better buy a battery bank or buy some other phone

I bought this phone a while ago, and everything worked well until one day when the phone completely drained of charge and when i tried to switch it on after charging, it went on a Boot Loop.
I then handed over this phone to the Motorola Service Centre in Bhubaneswar (that also happens to be the service centre of Karbonn, Micromax, Alcatel etc) on 28th November,2014.
They by the way are the most dumb people I have ever come across, I find government officials to be more responsible then these servicing people.
I am still waiting to get my phone repaired/replaced.
I went to the customer service center at least 10 times without any success.
The worst part is that I called Motorola on their toll free no.
and explained the issue, and they are saying the Parts for this phone are not available in India!
And they seem to have escalated the issue and told me I would get a call from the "Actual Service Officials" within the next 24 hours.
But they 24 hours wait has now turned into 240 Hours wait.
I would strongly suggest users not to buy this phone.
Only good specifications doesn't buy you a Customer Motorola, effective after sales service is also important.

I bought this phone when it launched, and I am posting this review after using it extensively.
It is the best mid range phone having excellent features.
It has a 8MP primary camera and 2MP secondary camera which is far better, when compared with its predecessor.
My views Pros:- *The battery life, which is the most important aspect is pretty good.
*Better gaming experiences than the old version due to larger display.
*The phone does not hang at all as against the other Low Cost phones which have flooded the market.
*The photo quality is excellent.
*The flash works amazingly during low light.
*I have seen people losing their cool, as half of a mobile's feature is nullified because of low internal memory.
This mobile obviously doesn't give you a reason to crib on those grounds.
Cons;- *The sound quality could have been better.
*The phone could have been slimmer.
*SAR value seems to be a big deterrent.When compared with Samsung devices the figures seems to high.
*Moto should work on reducing the SAR value when they plan the next version.
The phone is good, and that is the reason everyone is talking about it.

moto g2 is a superb smartphone.
Other mobile of the range can't touch the bottom line In Performance and in price.
Camera is superb No hanging after inserting 32GB memory card and having data more than 10 GB data Speed is much and much better than other smartphone like Samsung Grand series and low range Galaxy series.
Voice quality is superb It gives good 3G speed in compare of other smartphones on the same network It's 5" but not bulky due to its curved design Bes position of speaker for loud sound.
Clear conference voice and signal quality No call drop No hitting even hours and hours use I can't list out here all features here because I am collecting the features of MOto g2 by using it.
There are some lack also like Battery is not superb Earphone headset is not of best quality.
Not volume control in headset.
No music change control in headset Headset speaker is not so fitted with ear initially.
You will have to be used to.
Sound support stereo no mono.
Power button is not like previous version Moto g Its accessory should come as freebies Not good for small hand.
No one hand use

When i have purchased the Moto G (2nd Gen), i have get the date offer described as: Data Offer - 1 GB 3G/2G data per month for 2 months in 3G/2G circles for Airtel prepaid and Bill discounts of INR 250 and INR 155 per month for 2 months on subscription of 3G and 2G data boosters of 1 GB and above in 3G and 2G circles respectively Airtel postpaid.
I have got only 1 month free data.
I didn't get the same offer in 2nd month.
Also i complaint to Airtel regard this, but my issue is not resolved.
Are these offers are making fool of customers.
Also 100 Rs is deducted from my account for using the net, as the offer is not regulated on my number.

It is always a pain to know that the order you just received paying a lot of money is defective and that sinking feeling that "oh will i get new piece or again go through the service karo ,idhar jao, udhar jao circle "is the one that all dread.
I must really commend on the good job that was done when i posted my return request of Moto G2 and all efforts were taken by the CS team of flip-kart to get me the replacement on time without hassles.
I really had the peace of mind (which is usually nerve racking) during the entire process of replacement without having to lift my finger.
Really commendable job CS team..!!!

I ordered the product on launching day 6/9/14 but receive on 11/9/14.
In first view, it is the best phone (budget) but in reality the product is stuck.No matter it have 16 gb in-build memory and allow to use around 12 gb.
But when you fill its 6 gb and more, its performance take you to your worst nightmare.Its not actually Google product and more then 1 month since the lollipop update available, it did not get any update.
Also, since last 2 days it become dead however no accident happened.
Service center promise me to return product at-least 5 working days or 15 if there is some problem in motherboard.

Phone is very good at this price, Best buy.
But never use the Airtel data offer with this phone.
As usual Airtel having some hidden terms like, you should use this offer for only to download apps and software ( this is the reason airtel customer care gave me).
If you use it watch videos or download music ( this is the , it will detect from your main balance and empty your balance.
Guys who can take risk shall use the Airtel offer.
Airtel made flipkart as scapegoat to loot their customers

Dear Team I bought this product from flipkart almost 3 months back and now suddenly my phone is not charging and its dead.
Now I am trying to turn it on but it is not turning on.
When I do the method of keeping the power button pressed for 120 seconds but the screen doesn't turn on.
I have tried holding it for longer times too but the same thing happens yet it does not turn on (watched you tube video for doing so).
I have read out this problem is still in MOTOROLA Gen. 2 phones.
I want a replacement of the phone as it under warranty or get it rectify at UK or India.
Really its a big problem for me & Flipkart should resolve this issue as soon as possible.
Reply back for some positive solution.

Moto G2 !
A great piece at affordable price.
I got a faulty piece for first but was easily replaced by flipkart.
Thank you for the service.
The camera quality is great front facing is also not bad, works excellent in day light.
The ram should have been 1.5GB for more smooth multitasking,but looking at the price you cant really complaint.
16GB memory brings everything in your hand and this one has a OTG(On The Go) support too.
As said by the moto they will be providing 5.0 update to this device as early as possible.
Interface is almost pure android.
Though it has a gorilla glass 3 i have noticed some scratches on the screen so please ensure that you put on a screen guard as early as possible.
The stereo speakers are lound but sound cracks sometimes mostly when you play a song with heavy bass.
The battery life is average about 7-8 hours of moderate usage and about 4-5 hours of heavy usage.(If
the connection is 3G) Overall a very good phone by moto and in budget.
Go for it!

Moto G2 2nd Gen is a good phone when it comes to the screen size, looks, clarity, audio quality, gaming, Speed and so on.
But the main purpose of the phone gets defeated when there is no / poor signal.
3G is very weak.
Will get only Edge most of the time.
VERY VERY Poor Reception.
Very good build quality with poor network reception.
Also the voice transmission is very very poor that the person on the other end would never hear anything when you sound soft..
As a phone would rate 3/10 As a gaming and video/audio device 8/10 Trust Broken..﻿

Its a week now since I am using MotoG 2nd Gen and here is what i feel about this handset.
Overall the touch is smooth and nice and so is the performance but what i feel is missing is: 1.
More Features like Battery % in Text 2. Launcher and Lock Screen Customization 3.Pull down tabs like Wifi, Mobile Data should activate the functions rather than taking inside the settings.
4.Options to configure tabs in Status Bar pull down.
Battery Life is avarage and if taken care of can make this phone a great phone.
Will keep updating my review on more usage.

I bought this phone on the day it was released.
Around three months.
I have used this device to the core and tested it.
And this is what I felt after three months.
1.
A good budget phone( good for people who change their phones very often) 2. Build Quality: Not that great.
The phone kinda feels cheap and when it falls down, there are gonna be dents.
So be careful.
Dont make it fall or something :P 3. Display: Really good.
720p videos look awesome.
Screen brightness under the sun is less could have been a bit more bright.
4. Performance: 1 gb ram.
Initially, was a bit doubtful about it but trust me its a beast.
I have nfs, real racing, asfalt 8 and rarely lags.
Very rare.
There is no doubt on performance for the price.
I give it a 5 star. 5. Camera: Decent enough.
Flash is good, HDR works well.
6: Battery life: Very bad.
If you are a heavy user it wont even last for a day and for a moderate user it will last for day.
7. Gets heated up sometimes.
8. Sound quality is ohk not that great.
This phone is well suited for people who want good performance at an affordable rate.
If you are looking for good battery life not a good option but for the price its a beast.
I personally felt the build quality could have been better and battery also.
Rest everything is good.

the battery performance is very bad when compared to that of moto g and the head set sound quality provided with the device is very bad the battery is getting consumed even when no background apps are running personally i would not prefer it for any one

I had bought this phone as a gift.
I had done plenty of research before buying this phone and everywhere this phone has got praises.
Except for very few low rated reviews on flipkart.
Unfortunately, I ignored these reviews thinking they were one-off cases and ordered the phone.
Now, the 1st phone I got; 3G wasn't working and there was a buzzing sound coming from the earpiece during calls.
I got it replaced.
The 2nd phone had the same buzzing sound problem, but this time it was LOUD.
So I got curious as how can 2 random phones could have the same defect.
So I checked my friends' phones (around 3-4 moto g 2s) ALL HAD THE SAME PROBLEM!
Just that the buzzing was very faint, but when I pointed it out, everyone could predominantly hear the buzzing sound.
I requested for a replacement.
The 3rd phone had the same problem, however the buzzing was very faint.
Also, now the main speakers sound warped when I play songs with a lot of treble.
I believe the people who complained about the speaker now.
It is present in all the phones.
I cannot believe that motorola is selling such crap now that they have established a decent enough market share in India.
N many thanks to flipkart for giving me 3 replacements, just unfortunate that the product itself is a fail.

Google, through Motorola, got a decent upgrade through this 2nd Generation Moto G.
I also purchased MOTO G Ist Gen for 13999 and I now feel really having been duped into buying that 1st Gen crap.
When devices like Mi3 got into our hands for same price as MOTO G 1st, it was a huge letdown for those who purchased 1st Gen, MotoG.
That said, this is a decent device with middle ranking specifications and a camera that's just ok for casual photography.
Nothing to boast about.
The screen size is a good advancement over the previous iteration.
But even at 12999, this is, in my opinion, a tad on the higher side of pricing.
Now that we have Redmi1s & Mi3 as price reference, I believe that this a highly overpriced gadget.
Presently we have many options in this price range where we can get better phones at lesser price points.
If one can live with "late" updates, Huawei Honor at 6999 is a better option.

The icons appear ungainly big.
This is mainly due to big screen and small resolution.
I always like the old Moto G than this second generation phone.
The build quality is very nice though.
The USB cable, like first generation phone, doesn't detach from the charger.

This phone is gud as per its price..has excellent camera..which when u compare it with LG L90 8 MP is far better...Its been 19 days m using this phone....had captured photos around 800,only there I found some hanging problem..Backup is fair enough for the day..sound quality is not so good as expected..
By this time product's price should be reduced.

i bought moto g in october, very good service from flipkart, but after 50 days, my mobile switched off on its own, and then i couldnt start it, then i gave it to service centre, they told me that its main board gone off, so it has to be changed and that will take around 10-12 days.
after 12 days again they are telling that it will take more 12 days.
i mean with new product company has not got parts of it.
will not buy any motorola product in future.

Pros: 1. Touch is smooth.
2. Display is brilliant.
3. Very much responsive, notice no lag or delay.
4. Camera is ok.
Cons: 1.
The moto g version2 battery performance is very much disappointing.
As it could last long, with heavy usage of 3g & GPS, not more than 2-3 hours and, with regular use, not more than 7-8 hrs. 2. Low light photography not well.
3. Speaker volume is not good.
It becomes difficult to talk while on road.
4. Headphone quality too is substandard.
5. Takes 3-4 hours to get fully charged.

Battery back up is very bad and gets Heated.
Motorola and Flipkart please do something.

Moto E 2nd Gen is also pretty good.
But MOTO G 2nd Gen Battery back up is very bad.
Please get an upgrade and solve this issue.
Apart from this phone is good.
Looks good and works good.
I Love flipkart for the delivery and service.

FANTASTIC!
Just go for it.
1.
A qualcomm snapdragon(**quad core**) 2. Adreno GPU, 5 inch 3. 1 GB RAM 4. Long battery life 5. Google Update support(you will get Lollipop update) What else do you need!
Unlike "copycat Micromax" adn, who use shitty processors or "Shame-sung" fooling people, this quad core will give you amazing performance, and fast graphics.
Motorola is a developers company, you will get long life hardware.

i bought this in september 2014.it
worked great for 1 month and after all the problem arises.i
cant hear what the other person is telling and also he cant hear what i am saying,bad quality speaker with full of jigling sound even when not in use,sim slot 1 was not detecting,automatic off,hanging,heating,wifi complaint etc.so its my request for people going to buy this not to buy motorola(BRAND) instead you can buy indain brands.If you are not believing me ,you can buy this.but
all you want to know is that your nightmare will start on that day you are buying this.

Everything's good, It's fast, allows multiple apps at a time, no lags.
Best part of it it has a good camera with focus and burst imaging.
The sound of the speakers are crisp and loud.
Only regret that the battery could have been better.
Normally, the phone perishes after 3 - 4 hours of GPS use or 3G browsing.

The phone is looking superb,light weight,I tested this product by surfing the internet continusly for 9 hours till charge remains 7%,I played games for 2 hours continuously I heats only very little its negligible, even u can avoid that by cooling by means of CM security, the phone is superb speed but don't install high end games

I have been using the phone for 2 weeks now.
The phone is excellent in every aspect and a value for money.
Call quality is very good and loud (which is a missing feature on most of the smartphones today).
Camera on both sides are decent enough resolving enough details.Although, in some other phones , the front camera is more focused on selfies, but the one in Moto G2 is decent enough for video chats and casual selfies.And yeah, I feel that the battery could have been a bit better.

heating issues are there but after a week or so its solved.

I am removing my earlier MI3 positive feed back (against Moto G2).
MI3 will work only for few days,after that always problems (like many people told, I agree now), now I have given my MI3 in service center, but always telling that parts not available from past 4 weeks.
I am really frustrated about MI3 service center.
I see huge crowd always,You will get your time only after 5 hours of waiting there.
My work order number is QCI/XM/15/00032 Moto G2 is working fine as of now.

Now, its almost 3 months with the phone.
Overall I am good with the Moto G. Display, sound and software is great as expected.
However, I found moto G 2nd generation slower then the first generation.
The phone hang when you download a few apps from the store.
all display icons become invisible and its become dead for a few seconds.
apart from this single complain, I am happy with the device.
Moto needs to work on the problem, probably a processor update or software improvisation can solve this problem.
at last, great phone at this price.

{
Shridhar Toshn...
Have been using this phone since last 2 weeks.
Overall a good phone.
But some cons: 1) Takes 3 hours to charge full battery.
It last for 30-36 hours depending on usage.
2) Notification tones and ringtone level remains same.
There is no separate settings for setting notification tone low.
3) Personal mail syncing sometimes does not work and has to be done manually.
May be one time issue.
4) Does not come with a USB cable.
Flipkart delivered the product before the scheduled delivery date.

Ordered for moto g 2nd gen (Black) last week, But I got totally AWKWARD COMBINATION of Mobile phone and accessories.
BLACK COLOR PHONE WITH WHITE COLOR ACCESSORIES.
requested to change it but denied.
After one week of use, facing MORE PROBLEMS like WI-FI CONNECTIVITY AND HANGING PROBLEM.
Requested to replace it BUT REQUEST AGAIN TURNED DOWN.
If flipkart has to turned down every request then Y showing the status at home page "30 days replacement guarantee".
I wanted to buy google phone thats the only reason I came to FLIPKART but I think I made a mistake which I have to pay now.
I WILL NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM flipkart in the future.

I ordered Moto G2 in flipkart on 12th Dec'14 and the delivery was scheduled on 20th Dec'14.
But yesterday (17-12-14) in Tracking Order there was a message that "Your order is out for delivery".
But today 18-12-14 the order was cancelled and the following message received to my mail "We regret to inform you that our courier partner was unable to deliver following items in the Order OD201524143487280300." It is very worst experience in Flipkart I had.

Since specs are available on the net, just a quick notings of experiences:- Pro's - Good solid build and feel - Flip cover also available on flipkart strongly recommended - Good Camera both in still and video - Average battery life - Gorilla glass screen - no screen guard required Con's - A little under powered - lag while switching apps / sluggish response - Mini SIM so get yours cut / changed in advance :) - Camera could have been better For the price point and reliable performance - recommend it !

BEST OF THE REST AT THIS PRICE TAG USING PHONE SINCE LAST 4 DAYS ITS NOT JUST PROS AND CONS , ITS PRO'S, OK'S AND CON'S PROS: 1. GOOD AND FAST PROCESSOR - NO LAG 2. CALL QUALITY TOP NOTCH WITH NOISE CANCELLING 3. PURE KITKAT WITH GUARANTEED " L " UPGRADE.
4. LOW LIGHT PICTURES IN CAMERA EXTEREMLY GOOD. 5. LAST BUT NOT LEAST - SOLID BUILD QUALITY.
6. EXPANDABLE MEMORY.
OK'S 1.SCREEN PPI AND COLOR VIVIDNESS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
2. CAMERA NOT THAT TOP NOTCH BUT NOT COMPLAINABLE.-GOOD
FOR THIS PRICE RANGE 3. FRONT SPEAKERS- MANY PEOPLE PRAISE ABOUT THE FRONT SPEAKERS , BUT IT REALLY IS NOT THAT LOUD, THIS IS MY 5 TH PHONE IN 3 YEARS AND SO I CAN EASILY FIND THE DIFFERENCE. 4. MUSIC AND SOUND OUTPUT QUALITY NOT GREAT BUT OK, EVEN WITH HEADPHONES. 5. FINGER PRINT MAGNET BACK COVER.
6. BACK PANEL LITTLE SLIPPERY.
7. FOR SOME HIGH END GAMES PROCESSOR HAS SOME LAG. 8. COULD HAVE DONE WITH A BETTER CUSTOMIZED UI , STOCK ANDROID (EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST KITKAT) FEELS VERY CHEAP AND NOTHING SPECIAL.
BUT THIS CAN BE OVERCOME BY PURCHASING EVERYTHING ME LAUNCHER OR THEMER APP WHICH IS THE GREATEST IN UI CUSTOMIZATION HOME REPLACEMENT AVAILABLE TODAY IN ANDROID STORE.
CON'S 1. THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS IN IN DEFAULT WITHOUT BRIGHTENING IS TOO TOO LOW , EVEN FOR INDOORS IN A HALF LIT ROOM.
JUST INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS BY ONE POINT AND EVERY THING IS FINE. 2. NO DLNA AND NFC. 3. NOT A VERY GOOD AUDIO CODEC.
4. LAST BUT NOT LEAST , BULL SHIT EAR PHONES, COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITH JBL IN EARS.
SUGGESTIONS: 1. COULD HAVE DONE WITH AN MORE GRIPPIER BACK PANEL.
2. A BETTER HEADPHONES. 3. COMPLETELY CLOSED FRONT DUAL SPEAKER VALLEYS.
IF YOU KEEP THE PHONE DIRECTLY UNDER A LIGHT AND LOOK AT THE EDGE OF THE SPEAKERS YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND THE BOTTOM FROM WHERE THE SPEAKER EMERGES, NOW THIS SMALL GAP CAN BE PRONE TO DUST AND SWEAT WHICH CAN GO INSIDE.
4. USB PLUG-GABLE CHARGING PLUG.
5.3000 MAH BATTERY.
THATS IT, FINALLY IT IS A GOOD PHONE, EVERY THING HAS ITS PROS AND CONS, WELL YOU CANT EXPECT GALAXY S5 ALPHA FEATURES AND SELL FOR 13 K, BUT WORLDS FIRST MOBILE PHONE MANUFACTURER AND POWERFULL ANDROID MAKES DEADLY COMBINATION, THERE ARE PHONES LIKE KARBONN, ALCATEL, XIAOMI M1 WHICH MAY HAVE DOUBLE SPECS AND SELL AT THE SAME RATE OR SLIGHTLY HIGHER.
BUT CANNOT BE COUNTED FOR ENDURANCE.
BECAUSE MY 4 YEAR OLD MOTOROLA ATRIX 4G STILL SMOKES SOME OF TODAY'S NEW AND GOOD PHONES FROM TOP MAJOR INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURERS IN ALMOST EVERY RESPECT.
HENCE MY OPINION """"" GOOD DEAL """ And 3 Day Super Fast Delivery By Flipkart

Shopping Experience: I tried placing the order atleast 7 times before finally placing it.
2 times it went out of stock, and even after placing my email for a notification of availability, i didnt get any email.
While placing the order, the offers kept changing every second, and finally the product went out of stock !
Finally, I had to place my order like i was catching a Shatabdi Delivery of Product : I ordered the product and was given an estimate of Dec 16 for delivery.
I received it on Dec 12. 5 stars for delivery and package quality.
The Product itself: I had checked the technical configuration and found it to be pretty good at this price range.
saw useful comparisons with LG 90, but looking at the number of pieces sold, i went for Moto G.
The appearance of the phone is very classy, the white color gleams out.
Battery backup is pretty good with average calls, gaming and net surfing.
I believe it could last more than 2 days if not fiddled much.
I did experience some heating while playing Gunship battle around the camera lens.
The Andriod version takes some time to get used to after you have used a Samsung.
Camera quality is quite good, I did see some concerns for the Moto E camera, but now im fine.
The size is as large as Nexus and takes a day to get acquainted to after you've used a 4 inch screen.
If you have the above 10 budget, you can go for it.
Thanks

If u r stock android lovers go for this.
This is the best mobile.
It meet all the basic requirement a mobile should have and a person should hold in their hands.
Design is OK thing, not great processing is good.
Fits perfectly in the hands bcz of curved back.
Good to have removable back shell atleast, so that we can use different coloured back shells Only dropout I felt badly with this mobile is battery backup.
It is draing too fast.
I hope lollipop update will helpout in this matter.
Definetly if u r is travelling out of staton, one should carry backup battery for sure.
I want to add one more thing is, flipkart gave awesome delivery, they delivered this in just 30hrs after I placed the order.

I ordered the phone on its launch day....Flipkart was giving so much offers on launch day...but almost all were useless....Delivery is on time...The phone is a good one with very good performance...Initially Battery performance was very bad....but after a few days battery performance improved....The rear camera is very bad with respect to a Nokia with Carl Zeiss lens....low light performance is below the line.
Otherwise its a good buy...Slim nd Sexy phone... Very good display....The price should be within 10k.

I got Moto G 2nd Gen on an amazing price for Rs 11749.
After 10 days of use, ohh boy!!
It works like a charm.
Only con is the battery, but since I'm not into heavy gaming, it lasts 24 hours easily for me.
Though I would rate the Flipkart Logistics Service 1 STAR.
They stopped the delivery of Moto G all across Noida once the price went down.
I had to order this to my friends place in Delhi.

I bought this mobile for 8000/- on exchange of my old mobile with flipkart on bigBillion day sale happened in october.
First mobile which I received has few display problems and flipkart replaced with brand new one immediately after my complaint.
I simply love flipkart service and price cuts always tempt me to buy from flipkart.

I purchased this product one month back and the phone was working alright for few days.
After few days the phone experienced some problem with not getting switched so i took to their authorized service dealers in pune.
The experience has been horrendous since then, their service centers are shared by many multi brands and they have highly non-professionals at their service center.
They committed that they will give an estimate and solution to the problem within 2 days but there hasn't been any communication after 2 days so i spoke to their service center and they claimed they will take another 7 days to give me an estimate and when i insisted that i need it urgently they replied in an irritating manner to contact motorola.
The customer care of mototrola also is not equipped enough with info and they hung me up for around 30 mins to finally escalate the matter further.
The matter will take another 2 days and till then i am clueless what this company is doing for its customer.
The service level is below pathetic than any brand in todays market and i fail to understand how can a mobile take 7 days to identify the problem.
Motorola is not recommended for its after service after the experince that i have went through and i was planning to buy for my mom but now i wont even recommend at all for their service standard.
I request flipkart and its users to discontinue using moto phones till they resolve their service standards.
Pathetic!
Disgusting! Non-professional

5. Full HD screen Cons: 1. Better if it has 2GB RAM.

Hi Everyone, I have bought a Moto G-2nd Gen (DEC-14 edition) from Flipkart.
Flipkart packaging and delivery process can't be questioned.
Mere holding it in hand gives you a feeling that it is superb.
Though I haven’t started using it in full swing, on start up I found some unerasable/unscrachable/unremovable logo marks (specifically battery & back cover logos).
I erased some of the logos by rubbing them with cotton after applying nail polish remover onto them.
But this is not working for the battery & the back cover logo.

Nice product of its range...
If you are android lover this is the best option in the range of 13k.
It satisfies all your expectations from a smart phone If you are windows lover then ill strongly suggest to go for nokia lumia 730 as the look and feel of it is awesome.

I was spell bounded and completely overwhelmed by the prepossessing sight of my new phone.
The breath taking features and the mellifluous sound of its speakers are impeccable.
The camera and video quality are verisimilitude to the real world.
Playing games with such a riveting graphics quality is a feature that can only be explained while experiencing.
The a la mode looks of this phone is something which can only be compared to itself coz i don't feel any other phone can stand in competition against it!!

My review title may confuse you ...but thats what i actually mean... Pro's: There are several pros ...camera n clarity is super good...user interface is good..the storage both internal and external works fine with good apps(ES3 file explorer) Con's : As you might have heard the network issues ...yes it troubles a lot...i m writing to moto on that too...post issues in their Fb page... General: I 've been using this G2 for two months now and i feel my money has not went down the drain...looks are cool feel comfortable with the cons so it dont pester you....

This is not regarding the product but the cheating and fraud done by Airtel for offering 1 GB of data on 2G/3G connection on this MOTO G(2nd Gen) product.
I purchased this product and followed the steps mentioned (view T&C apply) for getting this offer activated on my mobile phone.
I visited www.airtellive.com/offers
using on mobile phone after enabling data network and I got the following message "No offer exists for this device".
I immediately called up FlipKart customer care and they told me that this is not their responsibility and I have to contact airtel for the resolution.
I contacted airtel but there has been no response from them.
I have wasted so much time and money while moving here and there from flipkart and airtel and so on.
At least flipkart can ensure if the offer by Airtel in genuine or not.
Either this is mis-selling attempt by Flipkart for selling their phone or they have send me the second hand phone where the airtel might have disconnected the offer after giving one.
There is definitely something wrong.
I am user of Flipkart since last 5 years and never face such fraud in these years.

we 3 friends purchased this phone at same time.
one device started showing issues in about a month.
Contacted FlipKart support.
After initial diagnosis, there was no response from FlipKart and now they are saying your 30 days is past and we cant replace your device.
The support only cares for his rating and not on the resolution.
I will never recommend anybody to buy on Flipkart from the experiences I had with FlipKart.
I have decided to take this legally and will be initiating the process soon.

I received a defective piece on delivery.
The ringtones and sms tones were not ringing when notifications were received.
On exchange I got a working model the 2nd time only when I realized that the first one delivered by flipkart was probably a used one because it had a clear screen guard already on it which I thought was the usual protective one received from the manufacturer.
But the new one's screen protector had specs printed all over it.
I am pretty sure the first one delivered was a returned item (probably from someone who had found the same ringtone issues and returned) which gives me a bad feeling about Flipkart that they are trying to shove the defective pieces again onto other buyers thinking that someone would at least quietly keep them !
Pathetic !

Just got the phone 4 days back.
Although the phone is quite good and all but the Sim 1 slot gives a lot of trouble.
It does not catch network most of the time.
While there is no problem with the other slot at the same time.
This was never expected from a brand new device.
Flipkart, please help.

I liked the phone by reading reviews and specifications.
But after started using it, feel dissatisfied at many fronts.
Battery drops quickly, have to use many battery saver apps to use it throughout the day.
Display is one factor that attracts, but fails at other ends in terms games and hardware rendering apps.
AnTuTu Benchmark score is approx.
18k even while testing, it was crashing like anything.
Many apps just crash in between a using it and make device unstable.
Its just value for money phone, just use it as a normal smartphone with limited use of apps.
Dont expect much.
It is good to view videos.
Overall it is 6.5/10 based on my experience.

I just bought 3 months back MotoG 2nd gen phone set.
It was working fine but suddenly I started facing issue with Calling feature.
It was Unable to connect to the Network and when few of my friends suggested try with 2nd sim slot, it started working.
Now I know at least 4-5 people who have faced same issue in Moto G 2nd gen.

Considering the specs and comparing the performance, the phone outruns many of its competitors in the price segment.
Overall a satisfactory device for regular use though high end games is often a bit laggy.
For example Asphalt 8 and The dark knight (the older paid one).
Pros include latest OS which WILL be updated to Android L or Lollipop, and the almost stock android experience is really nice.
16gb internal and the sd card slot makes the phone a really good option for people who carry heavy amount of music, videos and movies.
Lastly, had the ram been 1.5 gb, it would have added a couple of more thousands but the phone would have been legendary.

I am a iPhone user and have purchased this phone for a change but was bit disappointed with respect to the expectation that I was having.
user experience when compared to iPhone was not so good.
Battery power management in the OS is also not good.
I saw many times message that application stooped working and later they start.
It looks like they are crashing.
There are lot of scope to improve the user experience and the Operating system.
