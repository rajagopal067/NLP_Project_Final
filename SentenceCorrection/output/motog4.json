 First impression is good
 Back panel is of god quality and has good grip
 To phone will not sip from your hands easily
 Dual speakers are good
 I struggled with importing contact from my old feature phone using built "Migrate" pp but finally successfully imported all the contact
 But the extra information like birthday birth dates are stored in my old phone for each contact was not imported
 I didn see any option to add birthdays anniversary dates to contact in Moto Os which is disappointing
 Even though it is mentioned on few websites, I was not able to import photos and video from my old phone using Migrate pp
 Multi user and switch user option are good...
 I can now hanover my phone with guest user to my son os years old with no fear of looking any data os While setting Radio first select the region and then scan for stations
 Camera is not very good I struggled with rousing and capturing initially
 Of you want to capture the moments fast it is not useful
 Now light picture quality is very bad even with flash ON).
 After receiving the new camera updated I can adjust the exposure which is a good features
 all explore the camera more and will post the updated
 I didn like the headsets provided with this phone
 USB cable is not provided
 os SAR value is very high (4.52 W/kg at Head - 1.6 is SAR limit in Indian I guess Oneplus One is having very low SAR values
 It takes around 3 his to fully charge the batteries
 Of I use the phone while charging I got wired experience like while tapping backspace, "." was inserted or while tapping some letter adjacent letter was inserted
 When I turned off the power and restarted the keyboard it worked fine
 I observed the same many times even him not charging the phone
 him unable to realize the speed dial list icons wanted smaller sized icons I was not able to set custom sound equalizer for speakers
 I also didn like the goose may player which has limited option
 Now to record the calls
 Seems there is no default option
 I may need to download some pp for this

 Moto G and Generation is undoubtedly a fantastic Android phone in 10k-12k range
 It has everything required for a moderate to high usage
 For this order I was quite disappointed with Flipkart delivery
 I ordered this phone for next day delivery
 Will evening of the expected delivery day I called multiple times in WSRetail and Flipkart call centre to locate the delivery boy and an estimated time of delivery
 And all of a sudden I got an SMS stating the phone has been delivered which was a shock for me
 I was at home all day awaiting delivery and nobody knocked my door
 Even then when I called Flipkart call centre I got reply that it will be delivered shortly
 After an hours when I was leaving my building the security person told me that Flipkart has delivered my order at the security gate
 His was extreme example of being un-professional.

 Am very satisfied after purchase of this device some months ago
 It is fast the camera is good voice quality is loud and clear fully charged battery lasts the whole day with reasonable internet use
 I also enjoy the text predictions
 There is a bit of a problem with the phone getting heated after lengthy internet use and sometimes after a long call

 Within 2 month right half side of the touchscreen has stopped responding
 Lots of problem with the connectivity, call connect but connection is one way
 Factory rest also did not help
 Not sure if flipkart sold me a refurbished product in the name of discount sale
 Also Head some reviews about Os looks as if motorola is constantly degrading the product quality
 Now I am advised to run around the service center

 i bought this phone and soon i discover heating issues and software lagging issues in this phone
 i requested for replacement but it seems to be lengthy and firing procedure
 Technician called up and tested my phone remote and declared phone has no issues.(LOL)
 Another thing because of my job conditions i can not take a leave on a weekday, now this person is saying go see to service center then he will help you in this matter
 Again then what the use of 30 days return policy
 Should have declared you will not get a replacement at any cost
 There are the privileges of being Flipkart First Serf i am seriously hoping if flipkart take a look in this matter
 or else it will be really a big disappointment to me
 Even i know flipkart will have no effect of breaking relation with one customers
 To even i am doubtful whether to keep hopes or not

 I have been using the Moto G and generation for the past three months and below is my review in brief - 1.
 The processor of the phone may be just quand core but it provides really good results even in heavy usage
 I have played games and listened to music via my bluetooth headset and also downloading 1 os of moves all at the same time without any last
 It does not heat up too...initially it does though in the first use later on it doesn
 2. Moto provides the latest Android updated quicker than even Google can give to its Nexus which is a major boon for users who like to have the latest Android version to brag about to their friends
 3. Coming to the camera it is a imp rear and imp front
 The camera are good not great as compared to hind phone but as compared to the same price phone which boast a 13 up camera I would say the pictures clarity is the same if not better on the Moto G2.
 The os video recording is also good
 4. The display of the phone is just 720 x 1280 fixed but the pp is very good as compared to other phone and I dont find much difference
 The phone has good viewing angles and in bright sunlight too it is visible
 Overall Motorola doesn just put any hardware of high speck and expect it to work fearlessly it does test it phone for performance and most importantly long lasting ability
 There are phone that give better speck like oct core processors and 13 up camera but they wont give you a better performing machine
 Definitely Motorola phone are donna last you longer than any other phone in the price range for the simple fact that it perform in every situation when others fail
 Its a trusty phone that wont let your hard spent money go waste...go buy it !!!

Jimmit Shah
 I bought the phone some three months ago and immediately started facing issues
 Pp such as moneycontrol keep frequently crashing the screen brightness is not that captive and the screen size is less than 5 inches due to screen buttons - a lot of body space wasted
 The battery!!! Today I fully charged the phone at 3.00pm.
 It 7.00 pm I have 58% battery and I was home the entire time with almost zero phone calls!!!
 The battery issues started in the first month itself when from 100% the battery fell to 18% in 5 mind Os have the screenshot).
 These days I have to charge every 8 hours or so else I will be carrying a piece of rock instead of a smart phone
 Request everyone to stay away from this phone

 Not this phone within two days of ordering............ writing this review after 2 weeks of complete usage
 PROS - 1.Great display... crisp display... Great to watch videos.... 2. Awesome rear and front camera...some pp said that camera is not unto the mark...(they dint know how to use it effectifvely)..pic are crystal clear and perfect.... nature photography lovers will love it..... 3. Battery performance is just like andros phone but slight better than others... charge lasts day with normal use of go calling etc..... CONS- none yet.... no lags.. no issues.... VERDICT- great phone...great price range....must buy.... P.S : Flipkart's amazing delivery is the cherry on top

ANS: dont usethe phone for long time countinously.. Q am getting sound from speaker it is disturbing me a lot ....? ANS: u update or apes it will be resolve....

 the device is really good in all aspects of configuration
 but here it failed in few basic needs of mobile honest
 it makes continuous cracking sound on calls
 i did complain flip-kart for this problems as they said i installed there thirty smart-check pp also
 they couldn help me and also denied for return policy
 one more major problem was the SAR value it is very high for head as 1.52w/kg.
 (INDIAN SAR forms is maximum 1.60w/kg) its just 0.8w/kg less than that
 i usually be on calls for hours together
 these radiation did affect me very badly it also does same even while using iii and Bluetooth.
 i suffered from never head ache for almost days tried all medicines
 finally removed him from motor and started using my old Samsung mobile phone (SAR VALUE 0.32w/kg) felt really great relief
 and sold motor

 FLIPKART was the best online portal in India and now they are the worst online portal in Indian
 Soon the portal will be banner in India due to their cheating business
 They have so called customer kill department who never understand the issue and keep on irritating customers
 Stay out of Flipkart if you love your money
 I want to share the experience with my latest purchase of Moto G and Men
 I purchased Moto G on word June and from there my fight with the worst portal in India has started
 The phone received by me was defective and it had issues in the speaker
 I lodged complaint the very next day
 Flipkart tried all their ways to retain with me
 They asked me to install the smart check soft aware and mentioned that the executive will call next day which never happened
 After struggling 5 days they called and asked me rest the phone which never used
 Have you ever experienced
 I am sure there would be people who purchased from Flipkart!.
 The executive tried all his technique to establish the fact the phone is in good condition and without issues but in fact it is a defective piece which they sold with discount rate
 I never agreed whatever he said and later the guy agreed to replace the item
 But they said they cannot pick up the item and I need to send to them
 I spend Rs.310.00 to sent the item to their warehouse on th July
 os os CALLED HASSLE FREE RETURN!
 BEST os WORST SERVICE!
 FLIPKART WINS!
 I received the replacement on with July which is after 10 days
 WHAT A SERVICE! FLIPKART WINS!
 The replacement item was also defective
 When I switched on the phone it showed only colored lines
 I again lodged complaint
 Again they asked me to install smart check software on the phone which has no display
 WHAT A CUSTOMER SERVICE AND INVSTIGATION CAPABILITY! AGAIN THE BEST os WORST SERVICE!FLIPKART WINS!
 His time I clearly mentioned that I will not spend even single rule to send a defective piece
 Flipkart never agreed and asked me to wait till and July to get an answer and on and they closed my ticket without resolution
 I reopened the ticket which they closed again
 When I opened all my previous tickets and opened new tickets for the issue
 I have sent out 84 email to them
 They made a customer to write so much
 FLIPKART WINS! Finally after all bad email communications they agreed to take back the product through courier service for which they provided me token which was opened for 24hrs and they never informed the timelines!
 When I visited the courier service they did not accept since the token becomes invalid
 Again the fight started and provided new token after 3 days
 FLPKART WINS!
 It last I decided not to accept MOTO G anymore since FLIPKART carry all the defective pieces which were returned customers due to issues
 Flipkart found a good solution to sell os off through discount program
 To I clearly told them not send the defective product again and move the money to wallet to purchase a brand product which is not defective or dismounted item
 They agreed and confirmed that the issue will be closed on with July
 But to make everyone surprise
 The shameless creatures shipped another defective piece on with July and delivered on with July
 WHAT A CUSTOMER SERVICE!
 They have delivered a product which is already canceled by the customers
 By family who is not aware of this shameless and non sense business of Flipkart accepted it the item
 Everyday the customer case will give one ring and next moment write a SMS stating the non sense customer care could not reach out to me Now I am sitting with the defective Moto G piece FLIPKART WINS!
 They sold a defective piece
 By advice to everyone who love to purchase things online
 STAY OUT os FLIPKART!
 They are the worst haste free return policy portal and the worst customer support policy

 His was my rd Moto G and Men purchase on flipkart for my family members
 Easily the best & obvious choice in the entire segment
 Though I had cheaper choice with similar specification in 7k-10k range
 The peace of mind & quality confidence from having a reputed brand like Motorola tilted my decision in its favor every time I searched for a mobile
 In this occasion my sole requirement was to find a phone with best ear piece quality as my uncle is having problems in hearing the voice of the called on the other side in voice calls on his samson smart phone especially when in heavy traffic
 I started my research on goose with this single requirement in the price range of 10k.
 Surprisingly I found Moto G to be having a very good goodness idea 81 do voice output level
 In par & also slightly better than some of the best selling 30-40k range mobile
 His sound level is far better than all the mobile in ask range
 Even the loudspeaker is best in the segment
 Os if you are looking for a mobile that has best apiece voice goodness below ask prices this is the one for you
 However after using the phone for 3 days the display has completely blanket out
 I can feel the phone still working normal except for the display
 Despite not able to see display I can receive calls & talk when i touch on the location where the answer slide used to be
 I can hear the oncoming call & message notifications.
 But the screen was always blank
 May be a power circuit to the screen issue
 By uncle has started using it only after 10 days
 Os on the with day I raised a replacement request with flipkart via webster explaining in writing the complete issue
 Further I had to wait for 2 days for a call from the executive to whom I had to explain the same problem again
 He has asked to me go through the trouble shooting & it couldn be done as the screen was blank
 Finally he said that I would get another call from a senior executive
 His took another day & I had to explain the same issue & go through the same conversation again
 Finally my replacement request was accepted & delivered next day
 I am completely satisfied with the product MOTO G & also the fact that replacement was finally done as promised
 But the replacement process could have been better
 By uncle was using this phone for the past 3 months & no problem whatsoever and he is very happy about the voice goodness on the calls

 I wont recommend this phone to anyone ... i was facing battery back issues ( it was giving only 2-3 his back in 2G/3G network and getting an exclamation mark beside mobile network
 i raise the complaints for replacement and Flipkart technical support person requested me to wipe entire data and to do the factory rest i done & it worked for 2 days after that its started giving same error
 without waiting the next updated flipkart closed my request saying seller is refuse to accept your request for replacement.Now him not able to use this phone it wont son properly for Os os G network and keep on getting exclamation mark due to this mobile data is not singing to any apes like whatsapp & os

 Moto G and Men is an all-rounder.
 Sturdy build quality and impressive speck make this phone a value-for-money buy
 The battery life lasts almost 1 day with 2 SIMs, full-day If with 2 his of Os usage and average of 15-20 calls per day
 I have almost 46 apes that continuously stream bites of data throughout the day like Facebook, WhatsApp, Black Asana, Inbox, LinkedIn and the likes
 Charging using the Moto G charger takes a long 3 his to charge
 However replacing it with a fast charger reduces this time to 1.5 - 2 his
 Combine this phone with the original Moto G and Men Lip cover and you get all the protection needed for the device
 Overall very happy with the purchase
 And Flipkart delivered it swiftly which enhanced the overall buying experience online

 I had bought moto Os almost two months back
 The phone is very good in features but having call pick up problems
 He have to call back the callers
 The person calling gets irritated on why person is not picking up my phone
 The problem developed almost closed to month after installation of various pp
 I had called up call centre just two days before days of return policy and the person on support told to perform factory rest which was done couple of times
 Most factory rest problem again developed almost week later
 By the time return policy expired and I was told to get in touch with service centre which is in than
 Patches were applied and it worked for couple of days
 Again same problem developed
 Despite of writing email to customer support no response from flipkart.
 Of you have time to visit service centre multiple times
 His is phone for you
 He careful before you buy
 Head review of buyers first then buy
 Flipkart launching G3.
 Flipkart does not allow posting review of go on G3.

 After 1 month and 6 days of receipt its screen started going Off automatically
 I gave it to the Service centre at Varanasi and he informed that its screen was malfunctioning.
 Received the phone after 4-5 days on with July'15.
 It has new issues now its speaker is not working properly Voice call quality to other phone very bad and even the middle of the screen shows light blue when screen is ON.

1 star is comp...
 1 star is compulsory so there is that To my experience about this phone is disappointing,frustrating and beyond... Half the time screen doesn work other than that apes go haywire for no reason
 Sometimes it gives you so trouble that you can even receive a call
 And about the services after product purchase if you submit it to service center for repair there is no guarantee that it will be fixed speaking from my own experience I have submitted 3 times and each time rather than solution I got more troubles And customer care lets assume they are only there so you can call and share your regret that you purchased this products
 To my advice dont waste your time and money on this

 Display is also awesome.
 os The box contained the Shone Headphone, and On USB Charging Cable
 It would have been better if the Charger be a USB Charging cable
 Overall 4 Start And not to forget Flipkart's packaging, was as usual Awesome.

 Strangely enough the phone has occasional issues with the battery level indicator
 Even after a full charge the phone will indicate a level of 100 to 0 in a matter of an hours
 Happened a couple of times
 Putting the phone to charge again makes it jump from 0 to 100 in 5 mind
 An be quite misleading

 I bought the mobile considering its specification & reading all good reviews
 But the tough Gorilla Glass shattered after falling from just a height of 1 foot only on smooth floor
 Now I have to spend Os to repair it and service center told that this will not be covered under warranty
 Moreover the service center in Guwahati has very slow response & dont have the spares as well
 It said 'It'll take more than 2 weeks to change the display
 have not received any help from Motorola Customer Are also
 By Samsung Grand fell 10 times if not more but the glass got no scratches
 Why Motorola is selling mobile with false claims that the display is rougher with Gorilla Glass
 I shall advice all the buyers who are planning to buy Motorola honest please reconsider your decision
 him at total loss buying the Moto G and Men mobile and regretting my decision

 Rose The camera is WONDERFUL and the pick come out sharp and brilliant as if from a professional camera

 I Have to charge it everyday
 if you continuously play with your mobile , is into gazing or watch moves or is continuously in whatsapp then you will have to charge it after every 6 - 8 his
 I charge it fully before starting for my office and by the time I reach after 1 1/2 he it has already discharged by 15 - 20% and that too without any usage as i drive at that time

Prashanth ga
 His is an absolutely shabby product which has overlooked some primitive features especially 1. battery charging time - unbelievably takes 4-5 hours for a full recharge.
 When contracted the teach support the typical answer is it is per the design 2. battery standby time - lasts not more than a day for nominal use like talking os radio for an hour and some browsing
 3. Noisy loudspeaker - call receptor - especially while listening to os radio the speaker is noisy
 When contracted Flipkart support for returning this item they only ask you to install an pp for performing couple of technical tests
 The final judgement by them is quite obvious to conclude as no issues with the product and therefore the return request is rejected
 To if you are a big fan of moto g series please put off your plans and wait until moto go appears
 Please read the Flipkart return policy and put a check on impulsive buying abilities before buying this phone

 Moto G and Men A Telephone to watch out for
 Not it on the rd day after the order was placed in perfect condition
 Took at any sub ask phone and the first thing that you will notice at least the established bands that most of them have internal memory of 8 os only
 Believe me you would soon run out of this in a hurry once you start downloading apply
 First thing i noticed this is pretty good value for money at ask from Flipkart).
 It has a decent processor good display decent camera and battery life
 Moto Os is still the KING of budget Smart Shone
 Gros : Much-improved camera Strong battery life Solid well-built design Excellent value for money Will edit my review for cost if I come across with one

 A LOW Quality Screen is been inserted and sent to me as the replacement piece
 I dint know You would be such cheaters!! Really Disappointment... Wont know if i have to go for a replacement again for the fear of getting created again Us be careful when you get the Replacement from these fraud guys...

Unhappy Customer
 I would suggest you not to buy any product from Flipkart.
 I had been a loyal Flipkart customer but now their service sucks
 I purchased a Moto Os which is defective
 One of the him slot is not functional
 I raised a return request but they never called me at the schedule time as they need to troubleshoot before they replaced
 They say that before they call they will send a message to inform but I never received any such messages
 Worst Service ever from Flipkart.

Nilesh Oswal
 I doubt the originality of this products
 I was using this phone all well till last couple of weeks when it stopped charging all of a sudden
 When I went to show this to the authorized Motorola service center in June they firstly did not attend me as a customers
 Secondly when I insisted them to do so they took the phone saw it for 5 seconds and said that they cannot repair this under warranty
 The phone has 3 months warranty left then why can these people repair it and solve my issue
 I really doubt the originality of this product as when I raised this issue with Flipkart and demanded a replacement they took my request but have not yet got back to me inspire of contracting them 3 times till now
 I would raise this to the consumer court but wanted to write this review so that other customers are not caught up with such issues

 the scenes keeps going blank and i have to start the phone get the screen working again
 i have also requested a return for the product and all flipkart is doing is schelling a call with technical team again and again
 i never receive a call from the technical team and they keep postponing it
 I have been given a defective product and flipkart is not doing anything to resolve it

 His is one of the best phone out there when you take into account the price/performance ratio also the getting started or help feature is amazing its really useful for beginners who agent used to touch screen based honest
 Great work there Motorola.
 And as for Flipkart they did an amazing Sobs ordered on the th of July they tried to deliver on the 10th, but I want available so rescheduled it for the with a Saturday os .
 Not a lot of courier companies deliver on Saturdays but if its Flipkart's part logistics then your in safe hands

 Flipkart is getting worse out of the box product is malfunction and flipkart is not giving a damn about it I have invoked my return policy and they rejected it just because I didn attend their call Well not everyone is available 24x7 everyone has job to attend
 flipkart customer service is not responding at all they are hanging up the call again and again... Customer care is their to rectify our error not to create more
 Flipkart Should take action to replace the product as soon as possible

 After 2 months excessive battery drainage happened...(100% battery loss in just 2 minutes When I contracted Local Service center they told me to submit phone for 15 days
 Even after 25 days they said the battery has not come
 I complained Motorola and got to know the status was Completed before 10 days
 Again contracted the local service center They said they have changed the job-sheet not
 When I asked for status It was Touch-pad and Battery replacement
 "Touch-pad" was replaced without my permission...
 When I asked Motorola to give me full details of new job-sheet as him having old one They refused because there with service center and not customers
 Still him waiting for my phone and helpless took
 WARNING : Of you are from Udaipur, Rajasthan, wont To to "Motorola Authorized Service Enter parts will be replaced without your permission and Motorola wont help you... ( him facing the problem ) os Sorry Flipkart, Your services are great and him not blaming you.....

 By experience with the phone is good
 But the charger disappointed me as it got darkness in my house for a while
 Charger was burned due to an inner short circuit by its first use
 However charger was replaced by moto service centre
 The funny thing is the exhausted charger was an Indian made
 Chinese made charger is not making any issue
 He cautious on initial charging

Naveen Vasu
 Its a good phone with bigger screen in this range
 RAM is less so dont expect to do multi taking like shone or other high end Android honest
 Camera is average but is best in the price range
 Took wise not very good
 Design is good so feels good while holding without mobile cover
 With mobile cover it becomes very big and does not hold good
 Overall I am happy with the Shone
 the 1 star I removed is for the performance but still it is good in the price range

 I found only one god thing which was facility of dual him
 its baggy because ram is very less just 1GB.
 battery drain is too much on standby.
 i slept at 11 pm battery was 48% when i woke up at 6.30 am it was 32%(wifi and net was off
 no updated for long periods from current date andros 5.2 update was related to USA people 1 month back but still we Indians have not got
 clearly shows how much motorola is serious about their indian clients
 I would suggest to buy xiaomi products they are more user friendly and they are loyal to their customers
 or if u have money go for one plus
 for god sake avoid this shit
 but i appreciate moto x its fabulous in every aspect

 hey there i caught a MOTO G st gen on March 2014.
 And yesterday it died
 The service center told me that they need to change the motherboard and would charge me 4500 Indian rubles as its been 3 months above warranty period .
 ( new phone MOTO G and GEN would cost me 9000) A reputed company mother board going out like this is not acceptable
 i have been using Moto ever since the Moto King days
 The worst part is i have bought both my mother and sister MOTO G and genu
 now very ensure of its fate
 I am not going to pay this amount for an outdated phone i am ending this relationship at a very bad note
 I WOULD ALSO ADVICE PEOPLE os THINK TWICE BEOFRE BUYING ELECTRONICS ONLINE.

 Studio quality is good
 Charger could have been with a data cable
 It molded together
 Flipkart promised delivery of the product on with for an order placed on the
 I was not happy with the delivery estimated
 They delivered it on 14th.
 Still not happy with them for giving incorrect estimate dates
 They need to give accurate dates
 Delivery earlier used to be in 2 days flat
 Now it is not so
 Of this continues one may choose to buy items in stores around their locality rather than waiting endlessly.

 it has plenty of good features but battery power only about 2100mAh is quiet less when working on Os connections , also front camera disappoint me it has to be least 5MP at this range where other good mobile in this range provide this .

 Battery is not so good
 When i ask for return as the phone is getting heat flipkart said someone will call me for resolve the problems

 By phone temperature is always showing 41-42 .C.

 Flipkart has shipped me a faulty mobile and has been negligent in hearing my concern
 It is also arm-twisted to make sure i dont get the refund or replacement products
 It suggested some eye wash troubleshooting steps which is off no use
 Now they are not even ready to connect the call to the excavation team and give the proper reason
 I have already raised request for replacement 3 times in the past 22 days which has been unheard
 I have been a loyal customer to flipkart and have purchased tons of products
 But now i lost faith is flipkart and i just want this to be my last purchase with flipkart as i have lost faith in flipkart.
 Trying your luck with flipkart in getting a working product or else you will also be a loose like me

 From the day mobile was delivered to me till today I am facing tough phase as everyday I face some new issue idea speakers issue screen gets blackout, it hangs too much while operating and many other issues
 Even I called them up thrice as it was within the replacement period but I didn get any positive response
 They just did a mere formality by doing a so called speaker test and told everything is fine inspire of telling them all the issues
 Will now I didn find a positive response from lip part
 His mobile is just a waste of " MONEY " for me
 Advise all not to buy electronic badges from lip part

 First I had it for just once or twice but now its too frequent and annoying

 To for me bad rating unless I get my product replaced and working fine

 I bought this phone two days and my front reaction after using it is 1.
 Shone gets heated very soon
 You cannot talk for more than couple of mind
 I had to use headphone to complete my 30 mind office call 2. Shone battery is fast consumed
 Though this may be fixed by adjusting usage but still I think it is too fast departing when I used the phone with standard settings 3. Biggest issues seems to be in voice quality
 It is not great at all 4. Why does the speaker is at the lower end - may be ill get used to this but again this is odd design
 I may review the rating based on usage going forward
 I used phone for long official calls and dont think this phone will support me

 Replacement Policy of Flipkart is very good and worth mentioning
 The first one which had some problems was replaced by Flipkart immediately after the matter was reported to them
 The performance of Moto G and Men is very good till date
 The only problem area is battery which has to be charged daily and perhaps every smartphone has the same problems

 I am quite happy with the products
 I quite liked the saying of the Os and that the reason I bought the phone
 its quite a sturdy phone
 I only have one issue with the phone and that is frequently I fail to have signal on the phone
 Did not face this issue with my previous Android phone which was HTC Desire
 Specification wise I only wish that Moto offered a 2GB RAM rather than a 1GM RAM.
 Part from these I am quite happy with the phone
 I do have an issue with Flipkart thought
 They dropped the price by Os within a month of me buying the phone
 I think its a bit unfair on the recent buyers

 Ordered Moto G and Men
 It was delivery after 15 days that was first disappointment
 Exactly after one month phone is not working nothing appears on screen
 Shone gets extremely hot

Abhisek Basu M...
 I have been using the phone for 6-7 months now
 have never faced any major challenge other than lost network while other phone using the same provider in the area are enjoying the network coverage
 In such situations I had to either report or find network to resolve the problems
 Otherwise its good one value for money a budget phone from a big brandy
 him not a game so its performance meets my need
 However its RAM is smaller almost half compared to the other andros phone in the segment

 os I had recently purchased the Moto G2. and over all the product is nice to hold and does the basis well
 I am not a very heave user but the phone struggled on most part to work with few social media apply
 I am not sure whether it is because of the lollipop update but the phone becomes ver slow number of times
 For egg if you want to call a contact then click on the name and nothing will happen for the next 3-4 seconds then the dealer screen will appear and the call will get connected
 Over all a ok phone with a nice camera the pick come out really well and the display is also very nice

 His is a good phone with great build quality excellent screen color accurate and silk smooth to touch nice camera under good lighting
 The Lollipop OS is far improved from its predecessor but still laws behind customized versions of Samsung etc in terms of intuitiveness.
 Things are all hidden under the hood and you should know how use it from else where
 egg when calls comes there are multiple option os take the call os reject os reject with message etc this can be done by wiping right/left or up/down.
 But the problem is that none of these option are shown on the screen at first
 You need to fiddle around to see how to even take a call os Once you get used to it it is easy but there is a learning curved which I think could have been easily avoided
 The biggest problem however is the excessive radiation (SAR) which is 1.51 against the limit of 1.6 required in Indian
 Note that Samsung Os has only 0.55 SAR.
 That is a lot of difference
 Of you are sensitive to os exposure please be aware about this
 I have also seen the phone going out of network for a few seconds and coming back for no apparent reason
 Battery life is not very great hits 50% in a day with minimal usage
 However idle back with Os is exceptional lasts 3 days to hit 50% battery in may last up to 6 days
 Once you put in 3G, it consumed 2-3 times more power even under idle mobile data/wifi off

Arnab Bhattach...
 I purchased this phone for my sister-in-law.Not even a month went by when the phone started to hang misearably.
 He contracted flipkart but they refused to return the products
 After a few days the audit was also gone and then also flipkart refused to return and tried to troubleshoot the problems over call which did not restore any functionality.
 Flipkart is selling these cheap products with no guarantee and no returns even if they deliver defective products
 its simply a waste of money to buy this phone from Flipkart.

 Using this phone since 7 months my experiences are as follows os after 2-3 months phone started hanging because of installing apes as it can handle only few apply it will work great for those people who agent into installing many apply
 os with time battery back started to decrease when it was new it could run games and surf internet whole day but now even if I dont touch it at the end of the day its battery shows 30% remaining
 os not good phone for playing games it starts hanging
 os autofocus doesn work properly it takes 3-5 seconds to focus which is frustrating.
 To if u r light user go for it

 Greatly disappointed

Ravi D
 Flipkart sent me a damaged piece at the first attempt i have to fight for getting it replaced
 i would say flipkart return policy is very bad we would be informed that there would be a call back from flipkart at a specified time you would receive a call and always it disconnected due to some issue
 and if you call flipkart , they will ask you to wait for one more day
 this is not right , we are spending money and after receiving a damaged part does customer have to fight to get a replacement
 guns who ever face such issue - dont wait for the replacement guns to call , the computerized calling system is completely a nightmare just go and hit the call center number and give them left and right

 worst service by flipkart to solve my issue
 poor battery back not at all satisfied with moto mobile

 I would like to share few points based on my 2 week experience With Moto g and Men Positive Comment 1. Battery is Descent will be alive for 15 hours even after using Whatsapp, os and other online services
 2. Both front and Are picture quality is very good and bright
 3. Shone design is very unique
 4. Music and Video clarity is awesome.
 Pass Monster is fantastic.(should
 use some good ear honest 5. Shone doesn get heat up even after playing the games for more than 30 mind
 6. on call voice clarity is very good
 7. Music over loud speaker is very clear and pleasant
 Negative Comments 1. Contact gets happened in the speed dial list after you dial the number from contact
 It becomes too much clumsy and give you a headache of removing them manually.
 2. some room tap settings are very irritating
 3. there are not many customizing option
 4. Default ear phone are very pathetic
 To am using Senheiser ear phone
 Overall its a very good product and Filpkart's customer deliver and service is one among the West

 I have purchased motor on the very first day of release but experienced worst experience with service .
 Within warranty period Charging point slot gets damaged Mobile display gets hanged up al the time after few days of use and either motorola nor flipkart gives any service for that
 Sons 1. Charging slot being much thinner gets damaged soon
 2. Charger gets heated up like hell 3. Mobile also gets heated up
 4.Display gets hanged up 5.
 To Service for online purchase
 6.
 After sale service cost is huge where u can get a new mobile
 And only one authorized service centres through out pure centre
 There were 3 centres and due to continuous issues with Moto mobile 2 of the authorized dealers denied for service but when u contact with Motorola or flipkart they will provide you all 3 address for service
 And when u reach at that centre all come to know that that have stopped service for the Motorola.
 Once the charging point slot gets damaged due to any reason you need to pay 70% of total cost near unto Os for repairing to replace complete PCB else Mobile is of no use
 When i visited Service Enter at June and found many of motor & motor users facing same issues of Charging slot getting damaged
 And It June being only one service centre you need to wait for more than 2-3 hours for your turn to explain your problem with mobile which you can never claim n warranty
 To Us just think before purchasing MOTO Mobiles.

 Writing this review after 6 month of use
 Battery drain out very fast
 faced a lot of hanging problems
 you can not use map and music player together . 1 go ram is insufficient .
 call took 2 4 see to recognize the contact and call
 Only good thing is gorilla glass,camera and lollipop .
 Build material is also very good .
 overall not a worthy phone .
 To please check for alternative before buying it

Albert Basumatary
 Everything about this telephone is right
 That explains many things doesn it
 Will just state the bad things thought
 1.Stock Camera Pp sucks
 2.Also, video capture resolution could have been 1920x1080.
 3.Charger gets super heated you can make an follette with the same
 4.Battery life is oka but the may capacity itself could have been more
 Anything greater than 2200mah will be pretty good
 5.Doesn't come with a data cable
 Mob Sobs
 That should not stop you buying from this wonderful phone
 It runs like butter Os have seen very few andros devices live up to it
 The price is awesome.
 And many more wonderful features

 I have bought moto go after lots of personal research .
 There were other phone in the market offering higher specification at cheaper price .
 But finally I decided to go for it
 The first product which I received was a defective piece [ touch and network issues .
 I contracted flipkart and the replacement was made .
 The replacement procedures are poor and it takes lots of time .
 I had to courier the phone myself and they refused the amount onto my flipkart wallet .
 When I received my new phone .
 You wont regret buying this phone .
 Its an ideal phone for regular users .
 I play Shalt 8 without much lag [ almost smooth ] in medium graphics .
 The phone is smooth , handy .
 Overall I would recommend it to my front .
 To for it without hesitation .
 The only drawback is battery life .
 With iii and regular usage , it almost last for a day .

 I am really going to post about this on twitter and Facebook I bought cell phone from flip-kart days back and it start giving me display problems
 When i complained about this to flip-kart, then there are just giving a new timing to receive a call from their technical depart and i am asked to wait for the call.This is happening since last 2 days dont understand why the guarantee 30 days of replacement
 when i called the flipkart executive Same (Vadhu) to change the timing of technical call since i have a meeting , he did not behave properly with me neither he transferred my call to his manager even i requested him multiple times and asked me to wait for call
 I want quickly replacement of this hands as soon as possible
 I would request all not to go for flipkart option if you want to buy a cells
 There service is highly frustrated if the hands goes bad

 Of your buying a phone just to buy a new one in a weeks go for this
 have bought several smart phone over the last 5 years (HTC, Samsung, Nexus Nokia, etc and each one had lasted several years
 The glass of Moto G broke in less than a month because of a fall of less than one foot
 The cost of fixing the glass is about the half of the phone price itself
 him going for a new phone just to save myself of recurring expenses
 The phone used to be value for money before this happened
 him surprised that such phone are even sold these days

 Product is good it take too much time in delivering the products got mobile after 2 week.shown
 deliver on expected date and got product after 2 day delay and the flipkart team irritating by constant send meaning less email and sending sums regarding delay it added the another irritation level even not stopped sending sums and email after place complain for that
 it clearly show the careless attitude towards the customer .flipkart
 team not the customer orientation even they consider the customer take it granted and they only interested in only doing business not believe in the customer relationship
 I m not recognize the flipkart for the customer who live in the semi metropolitan city.it is good to buy some similar or even less feature phone instead buy on flipakart.
 at least u have got phone instance payment rather then wait for 14 day

 I bought one moto go sublime in april
 after using the phone for 5-7 days i experienced major technical faults with the phone like the battery was draining way too fast
 Moreover the phone switched off and the battery drained to 0 percent in 1 see from 81 percent
 this kind of incident occurred twice or thrice
 so i first initiated a exchange request
 i was assured of callback once a download a certain pp of flipkart's.
 no such call was received
 this whole process of calling the customer care nd not getting a call happened 4 times
 can u believe that
 Finally after 2-3 months they posted that your exchange request has been canceled and we r not to exchange or refund for your products
 completely outrageous
 not gang to buy any product from flipkart until and unless its not available anywhere

 Moto G and Men is my secondary phone which I bought for saving my Peri Os from my trips(Because it already undergone a display re-plantation surgery which placed a big hole in my pocket
 Unlike many others I fall in love with Xperia's water resistant capabilities and was searching for a phone which I can use at-least when it is raining and ended up with the moto go
 That means water resistance is the only reason which caused to switch my decision from Micromax Yureka.
 The following are my conclusions after using this phone for a months
 It perform the basic operations like calling and whatsapping very well(not so charmingly like my Peri does but the prize tag equals result Gaming is not butter-smooth but satisfactory results obtained from this area
 Again the prize tag that matters and it does pretty well according to its prize Calling while its raining is a party trick that still works
 I didn tried any underwater shooting unlike I done in my Os and him not sure it can done that with the exposed charging port GOOGLE CHROME KILLING os DEVICE frequently and I thought it is a problem with piece I got but confirmed with my fellow Os owners
 Multiple tabes which act like individual apes results clashes and it slow the phone like hell
 Using os Trouser solved the problem unto a level but I really likes the stock andros brother very much but nothing I can do here other than twitching my far browser.
 Moto guns please give some more processing power for the phone which offers future andros updated
 The problems getting bigger and bigger with updated
 Drowsing is a basic feature so dont mess it up
 Losing a star for outdated hardware
 You can still go for this because we gets a product which worth the money which we are paying
 Thanks for reading my review

 Vice phone but has following cost os battery discharges like hell after seven hours i have to juice it up
 os Seats up on playing prolonged games
 os Oil expensive in terms of what we are getting in this price band
 os Screen scattering issue as many have already mentioned
}
{
M.S.
 I had heard great reviews of Moto Os before I bought it
 But I guess we canst trust opinions unless we have tried something for ourselves
 its been almost 3 weeks since him using this phone
 Flipkart, as usual delivered much before promised time
 One concern I had after opening the box the phone already seemed to have two If connections previously configured To signal none of these was near me and have never caught them on any other If device I use
 His brought me to think if the piece I got was used by someone although for a short period
 Not sure if I can trust Flipkart on that anymore
 The phone looks good
 An be held and easily handled by one hand - I dont like those excessively huge handsets.
 Also this is my first Android phone so my experience will be affected by both the phone and the OS's performance
 Performance:- The battery back is awful
 I need to charge it frequently - Once every 15-16 hours after normal use
 His is when I play no games at all
 I have a few apply and I brows that all
 I was travelling the other day and there was a disruption in connectivity.
 I think some apes were trying to connect and suddenly the phone went haywire!
 Some random things opened on their own on the screen the flash turned on and the touchscreen stopped taking any input from me
 The phone was not even a week old at that time and I was so creaked out
 Even the power off button needs an input from the touch screen and the battery is not detachable so I could not just remove it and shut the thing down
 I somehow managed to forceful power it off after trying for 10-15 minutes
 I have also kept the vibration off but the phone still vibrated when I type
 Other features are okay
 I guess to each his own
 One more disappointing things I got the phone for 10.99k just 3 weeks back and its down to 9.99k already os

Praveen Rawat
 Beams I have just bought it 2 months back and now I am facing battery issue with this phone
 Of my battery is showing 100% then within 5-6 minutes it shows battery low indicator and finally within 10 minutes phone gets shutdown.
 One more issue is with this phone is if you are running 3-4 apes then it gets hang and some time I am not able to attend the call due to not to able to see the screen
 Today I contracted to customer care and I came to know a shocking fact that in case of submission of phone they do not provide you a stand by phone moreover their executive talk like "Hitler".

 Of something happens for your phone MOTO service center people will say that it is physical damaged
 They asked me to pay 8000 for changing the motherboard for IC.
 NEVER buy anything from MOTO

 Ought MOTO G and Men from flipcart, and i made biggest mistake in my life battery life was hardly 3 hours and i had charge mobile 4 times in day
 Also cell was heating a lot that it can burn my skin I had to carry mobile in my bag rather than in my pocket
 Customer service was even worst

Mallaiah Mejari
 After using the Moto G for 10 days found some issues and good things
 Rose 1. North at this prices
 2. Camera quality is good
 3. fine with internal memory
 cost 1. Taking 2 to 3 hours to charge 100% battery
 2. 100% battery will come for 10 to 11 hours only
 3. while charging the phone charger adapted is heating like a iron box
 4. Round clarity could be better
 some times noise is coming
 5. Some time signals not coming for one him other him is working fine
 to solve this we need to start the phone
 But its manageable.

 I bought Moto G and Gen).
 It worked fine for 3 months but thereafter I started observing erratic behavior of touchscreen.
 It works for few hours and then stops working for another few hours
 I handed over my mobile to Void Service Centre
 After much followed they returned it after 7 days mother board replaced
 But after 2-3 days the same touchscreen problem reappeared
 I failed to Motorola with the issue
 They responded by requesting me to hand over the phone once again at the service centre and share with them the Mob Description Os
 I did the same and handed it over to Void Service Centre and shared os Os with Motorola.
 After 3-4 days I got back my mobile (Touchscreen replaced and was assured by the engineer that now the problem has been completely resolved
 But to my surprise only after 2 hours the problem reappeared
 Again I wrote a mail to Motorola and in response they wrote that my case is closed and as per their records my mobile issue has been resolved
 However if my mobile is still having issue I have to hand it over to the service centre for the rd time
 I called up their call centre and the so called trained executive kept on insisting me to go to service centre again
 I asked them the number of times I have to visit the service centre if problem reappear or at least give me an assurance in writing that this time this issue will be resolved
 Failing to get any satisfactory response from Motorola I failed to Flipkart and they gave me an instantaneously solution by replacing my mobile

 prose good camera good sound of sterno speakers no over heating issues after 5 months of usage phone has never showed an responsive state,or such
 cost phone laws a lot in simple issues like showing contact list,the time between dial button and screen to appear is sometimes more than 5 seconds
 battery life is ok if only use is calling,but even connected to internet is enough to drain the phone in less than 10 hours,if you browse,game, whatsapp back is less than 5 hours overall the phone is not outstanding,an average performer

 The reduced price by 1000 just 3 days after I brought it lol..

 I guess Flipkart along Moto are Screwing the Customers... over all the Nobles good...
 But the Matter back up Os Pathetic i feel... Os on for New hours and Drowsing it will screw up the Complete battery...
 I have Requested Flipkart for Return and Replace with New mobile and the Customer care so called Technical Team tell me that if you switch on Os and Use mobile the Battery will Met Trained very quickly... Really!!!! IT's Pathetic from Flipkart i had Requested Return thrice and all the three times it was rejected...
 I feel Flipkart is Heating customers this way... saying that some Problem with products bought from us we will replace... but that doesn happen at all...
 For the worst ever Battery and Flipkart's worst Return Policy i rate this mobile with 1 star.....

Dhruv Viroja
 Hello Everybody I brought Moto G and generation before 6 months so after using six month I am really satisfied with this products
 firstly I am thanking flipkart for delivering this product safely and perfectly to me
 so after using it for six months I am writing this review firstly the build quality is very good but not awesome good because it looks like a costly premium device while holding it in your hand and not so good because it gets oily sweat by holding it in your hand for long time
 thee the display is just awesome its cool and all the colours are perfectly mixed and viewable.
 When the camera is awesome in outdoor lightning but it is good in indoor lightning pictures get bury in low lightning condition
 then about software software is working awesome it works perfectly but it does not support the state level languages like gujarati, Marathi,etc.
 though it has 1 os of Am but it works lag free because of the vanilla andros installed in it
 I has tested it with a very high end games like Shalt os GTA os Modern Combat 5. etc and the great thing is that it Supports OTG so with this functionality you can able to use a pensive , keyboard mouse all things tested anywhere and u can use this functionality to charge others phone like a power bank also tested)... so all over this us the awesome device...
 I will recommend to buy this... and thank you for watching my review...

 I ordered Moto Os and received it within 4 working days in Noida, UP.
 Shone is really good
 hardware is better in comparison to other honest
 Unable Camera is of good quality (both).
 The most imp thing in a phone is that it should last at least a year and half when I am spending 10K, and it appears that this one would definitely last that long
 To far so good
 I also believe more in Motorola than Xiomi, Pioneer Naval Enter and low range Samsung honest

 the When is great
 Have used the first gen but this is just great
 Not just it terms of specie but perform as Motorola claims
 The screen is crisp and the form factor of the phone is very good

Ganesh R
 Maybe with the lollipop upgrade moto G and gen has lost it
 The applications crash often,hangs or freeze a lot
 Very average performance for the kind of hardware on board Battery is average as well,5-8 hours on continuous usage is very less
 Hopefully upgrade will improve the interface
 Camera is a high point
 its worth only if the price reduces further
 Buyers can go for asks zenfone 2 which is a better prospect

 I had purchased this phone and in 2 weeks time the phone went dead
 Flipkart was kind to give me a new one which is working fine
 I went to the MOTOROLA service center at Rajajinagar, Bangalore.
 The experience is dissapointing.
 New buyers keep in mind the customer service is expensive
 A cracked screen cost you k which is 60% of the purchase value
 Think before you anna own this piece of item Shone is worth the bill .
 Motorola customer service is a complete let down

 Facing heating issue from day 1. device goes above 45 degree Celsus then upper part of screen stop working

 For me this product is not worth
 Of you are lucky then you will get the device without defects

nikhil nimbhal
 I have been using this phone for 5 months now and to sum it up in one words reliable .
 Degraded to Lollipop (OTA) which slowed down the performance considerably
 The phone will just die anytime, randomly, and will not boot up unless you charge it for 15-20 mind
 and Of you are outside and cannot charge the phone your out of luck os Shone has some lagging issue/glitches , some processes which stops to respond every now and then usually some goose process hence it requires factory rest at least once in a month .
 Seats up while playing games like FIFA, Shalt etc Works os with games like swordigo , shadow fight etc
 To summarize , I would definitely NOT recommend this phone to friend and family

Yathisha
 His review is about the user experience after receiving a faulty device
 With all excitement I bought this phone MOTO G and GEN and I am not satisfied with the phone
 Were are the reasons I did face an Issue with Battery To requested a replacement
 Flipkart People told me that they will replace my mobile with new Handset, But they sent me the Same Mobile
 The battery drains like anything
 It drained in less than 3hrs.
 It is Getting Reduced to 40% in half an hours
 The battery draining very fast and has to be charged every few hours even if the phone is not in use and all applications are closed
 To apes installed
 The OS itself is drawing heavily from battery
 Sometimes phone rings but doesn let to answer call
 Of you get more calls then its has to be always kept plugged in
 War phone are very poor quality
 I will suggest you to please dont go with this particular Mobile MOTO G and GEN.

 Hello All buyers Please read my story carefully before buying expensive products from Flipkart online sale
 In the name of online jumper sale/discount Flipkart sales defective product as brand new products with warranty
 In this business model flipkart is hand in glove with seller
 For example take my cases
 I bought a moto Os on 22 June 2015.
 The phone delivered on 24th.
 I discovered on the same day that bluetooth is not working
 He customers expect after spending thousands of Os for a product is to enjoy the product with all features meeting to the specification mentioned by the Seller (Motorola in this cases
 Of this is not happening it is defective product by basic definition
 For my cases Flipkart first committed me that they will arrange a teach visit and then Flipkart will decide whether to replace or not
 Surprising right
 Anyway in my cases the technician, on his visit discovered that MAC os was not set on my phone
 Must imagine!!.
 He did something on my phone and convinced my wife at home when I was away at officer that all is well took her signature and submitted all is fine
 When I came back home I discovered the same problem and raised the issue with Flipkart again
 When Flipkart said go to nearest Service centre
 Now I think I understood Flipkart Online jumper Pale model
 Pale defective product at cheaper rate enjoy the profit and let the customer run after service centre to correct it
 But Flipkart, do remember that not all customers take it lying down
 I have all the documents in my favors
 He will meet in the court in the coming days

 Overall phone is good Recent battery backup, nice feel when in hand

 War phone are pathetic cheap
 Shone is costly as compared to other honest
 Only buy if you have any particular reason for this phone(for me it was my his as she really liked the design so i had to buy for her).There are plenty of other handiest which are far better than this in every aspect

 I have to say it was a very bad experience for me with this mobile
 Didn't last even 6 months
 When went to Service center I am getting told that mobile has a liquid damaged
 The small limbs paper inside the mobile turns red is the indication of liquid damage as per company(Not sure how it happened since mobile was never exposed to water
 I will say mobile is very much susceptible to liquid damage which is not repaired by Motorola.
 Other board for the mobile is completely damaged which costs around 8000 to 9000 Os hence no point in replacing the new motherboard for the mobile
 Mobile started flickering after the 4 months from started and in the sixth month it stopped working
 Definitely wont recommend this phone to any of my friend relative or colleague of mine 1 star for this mobile

 Over heating and short battery life all most 4 to 5 hours
 Already using 3 similar hand-sets in my family but this time it was quite diss-appointing, Software and applications are working smooth .
 But axes of over heating of product is reducing the life of battery
 The battery depleted very fast and has to be charged every few hours even if the phone is not in use and all applications are closed
 Its so hot as it can be used for iron a cloth ......

 him writing this review after personally using Samsung Galaxy Grand Bony Peri Os and the iPad.
 By intent behind buying this phone was just to have a decent phone capable of performing regular functions nicely and with ease
 I didn want any extraordinarily speed phone which might have heating issues poor battery life and low call quality etc
 Os I decided to settle for this
 And to my surprise him not let down by my decision of buying the Moto G2.
 In papers the speck might not seem to fancy when compared with similarly prices phone from other bands but this phone is a GEM os HANDS.
 teres what I have to say First and foremost the look and feel of this device obviously without any sort of protection is amazing and it feels great to hold this device in hand
 Secondly the User Interface is simple and elegant with no nonsensical customizations from the manufacturers
 Thirdly The sound quality call quality touch and everything else is simply amazing
 Also the phone has a lot of RAM to spare despite having too many apes installed and running in the background
 Os not a concern at all
 The only point where it lacks slightly is the battery backup, which could have been better
 But considering the performance of today honest all definitely say that its at part or only better

 There is some lag in opening and closing the apply
 The phone that i received has a problem with the speaker so i have longed a return for this but not sure whether they will replace it or not
 The play store is crashing while dating the applications
 Some times the display gets blank
 A very bad experience
 Another issue i found with this order
 Flipkart charged me 10999 for this phone but the box of the phone states 9999.
 I have sent an email to flipkart support team regarding this not sure what action will they take
 Very much disappointed with flipkart.

 Moto G and Men is really a good phone with comparatively less costly
 Camera clarity is impressive
 Shone does not hang
 People looking for Small and handy Mobile can go for this products
 Only one drawback Battery Charger given by Motorola is not good does not fix to socket properly I tried all types of sockets but it dose not fix properly

 but after that I am not able to here voice during the call every time I need to start my phone then its start working fine for next 2-3 calls
 I have registered complain for return and I got call from seller He has checked device with smart check and he updated me to update latest software

 To I think sellers are selling defective stock which was return in past by other customers
