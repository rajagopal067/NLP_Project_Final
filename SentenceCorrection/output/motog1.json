 I am having the impression of Moto G which is very good phone but Os really disappointed me and found few bad experiences
 1. while in the call the device is getting over heated might be battery part 2. Touch sensitivity is bad and some time it will not work need to report it again
 3. I had bad experience while browsing battery is draining even phone is fully charged in the morning
 First time i really disappointed with the flipkart, my self and my friends ordered more than 100 products in the years (80% electronics all the extremely well except G2.
 I hope i may get replace piece

 USING PHONE SINCE LAST 4 DAYS ITS NOT JUST PROS AND CONS , ITS PRO'S, OK'S AND CON'S PROS: 1. GOOD AND FAST PROCESSOR - os LAG 2. CALL QUALITY TOP NOTCH WITH NOISE CANCELLING 3. PURE KITKAT WITH GUARANTEED " L " UPGRADE.
 4. LOW LIGHT PICTURES os CAMERA EXTEREMLY GOOD. 5. LAST BUT NOT LEAST - SOLID BUILD QUALITY.
 6. EXPANDABLE MEMORY.
 OK'S 1.SCREEN PPI AND COLOR VIVIDNESS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
 2. CAMERA NOT THAT TOP NOTCH BUT NOT COMPLAINABLE.-GOOD
 FOR THIS PRICE RANGE 3. FRONT SPEAKERS- MANY PEOPLE PRAISE ABOUT THE FRONT SPEAKERS , BUT os REALLY os NOT THAT LOUD, THIS os os 5 os PHONE os 3 YEARS AND os I CAN EASILY FIND THE DIFFERENCE. 4. MUSIC AND SOUND OUTPUT QUALITY NOT GREAT BUT OK, EVEN WITH HEADPHONES. 5. FINGER PRINT MAGNET BACK COVER.
 6. BACK PANEL LITTLE SLIPPERY.
 7. FOR SOME HIGH END GAMES PROCESSOR HAS SOME LAG. 8. COULD HAVE DONE WITH A BETTER CUSTOMIZED UI , STOCK ANDROID (EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST KITKAT) FEELS VERY CHEAP AND NOTHING SPECIAL.
 BUT THIS CAN os OVERCOME os PURCHASING EVERYTHING os LAUNCHER os THEMER APP WHICH os THE GREATEST os UI CUSTOMIZATION HOME REPLACEMENT AVAILABLE TODAY os ANDROID STORE.
 CON'S 1. THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS os os DEFAULT WITHOUT BRIGHTENING os TOO TOO LOW , EVEN FOR INDOORS os A HALF LIT ROOM.
 JUST INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS os ONE POINT AND EVERY THING os FINE. 2. os DLNA AND NFC. 3. NOT A VERY GOOD AUDIO CODEC.
 4. LAST BUT NOT LEAST , BULL SHIT EAR PHONES, COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITH JBL os EARS.
 SUGGESTIONS: 1. COULD HAVE DONE WITH os MORE GRIPPIER BACK PANEL.
 2. A BETTER HEADPHONES. 3. COMPLETELY CLOSED FRONT DUAL SPEAKER VALLEYS.
 os YOU KEEP THE PHONE DIRECTLY UNDER A LIGHT AND LOOK os THE EDGE os THE SPEAKERS YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND THE BOTTOM FROM WHERE THE SPEAKER EMERGES, NOW THIS SMALL GAP CAN os PRONE os DUST AND SWEAT WHICH CAN os INSIDE.
 4. USB PLUG-GABLE CHARGING PLUG.
 5.3000 MAH BATTERY.
 THATS IT, FINALLY os os A GOOD PHONE, EVERY THING HAS ITS PROS AND CONS, WELL YOU CANT EXPECT GALAXY Os ALPHA FEATURES AND SELL FOR 13 Os BUT WORLDS FIRST MOBILE PHONE MANUFACTURER AND POWERFULL ANDROID MAKES DEADLY COMBINATION, THERE ARE PHONES LIKE KARBONN, ALCATEL, XIAOMI Os WHICH MAY HAVE DOUBLE SPECS AND SELL os THE SAME RATE os SLIGHTLY HIGHER.
 BUT CANNOT os COUNTED FOR ENDURANCE.
 BECAUSE os 4 YEAR OLD MOTOROLA ATRIX Os STILL SMOKES SOME os TODAY'S NEW AND GOOD PHONES FROM TOP MAJOR INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURERS os ALMOST EVERY RESPECT.
 HENCE os OPINION """"" GOOD DEAL """.

 I used more Couple of andros devices and old Moto G as well till now and this Moto G next Men was poorest battery performance under both Os and Os network
 Battery is getting Discharged 5-6 hours after full charge which is very pathetic ... usage was very nominal with few mails and few calls with few sums
 To multimedia/Games play at all
 Of you looking for better andros experience with decent battery back this is not what is suggest
 otherwise Shone is awesome....no doubts...

 I ordered this phone Moto G and Men and within 20 days of the delivery the screen broken
 The phone had fallen from about one foot and that too on a thin cotton carpet and the screen broken
 I thought this is Morning Gorilla Glass 3 display
 When I took it to the service center they asked for Os 6500/- for the change of display since the screen breaking is not covered in the warranty
 That is fine but the Morning Gorilla Glass 3 screen breaking with one foot fall and that too on a carpet is not understood
 It just means they are just claiming it to be Morning Gorilla Glass 3 to fool the crowd since there is no method of checking the same for the buyers
 I have another phone from Moto in the family in
 a Moto E which didn even fall and there is a very minor crack in the screen
 His phone was with my wife who is very careful with her items but the screen cracked automatically
 I thought the cell phone was cheap but now I have landed up paying Os 19500/- total and at this rate could have got much better phone

 i used this oh from last 7 days...looks wise and feature wise its very gd...i can use 7-8 apes together but it never lags...but the only drawback is battery...moto g says that the lust for 24hrs..but here i observed that it lust less than 17-18 hrs...in which neither i play any game nor i listening any songs.just
 surging net and whtsapp for his maximum.now
 what is the main purpose of use a smartph??i think for me its only boy of internet...so with in 2 hours if the battery goes down,then why should people use this phone??please change the battery configuration immediately

 worst battery back ever , takes more than 5 hours to fully charge even after full charge the battery drains very very fast
 this 2014 moto g has serious heating issues even 5 min of browsing or using navigation the phone gets heated up like iron box i initially thought its only my phone that is having a problem , but i checked with two of my friends who also bought the moto g 2014 they too faced the same heating and battery issue moto G 2014 is a failure from motorola, if u dont believe me ask some one who have used the phone before buying
 i recommend not to buy moto g 2014 model

 I ordered Moto G on the with of October
 I was pleasantly surprised to receive it on the with of October with normal shipping
 Full marks for the buying experience
 The performance was acceptable and all was well for 45 days
 A chance drop of the phone from my shirt pocket on Dec 15 shattered the display glass
 The phone was working fine and just the gorilla glass was cracked
 Easy replacement
 To chance
 A call to to the Motorola All Enter yielded a k Quote for complete display replacement
 k to replace the glasses far as I am concerned on a ask phone
 I have decided to throw the phone and get another one Not Moto).
 Why co in sure the glass will break the next time the phone drops and I can afford to be shelling out k every other month The kicked is that Motorola offers a free one-time screen replacement for all phone ordered directly from its webster
 In Indian the phone is sold exclusively through flipkart which effectively rules out the screen replacement offer
 Talk about step motherly treatment
 To here me saying I and Goodby to the only Moto product I will ever own

 I have no issues with the specification
 I went on to buy the phone with my eyes open
 To no bigger
 The fun starts within an hours
 I have received the item at 1PM on Rep 8 and shot out a mail to Flipkart customer support within an hour describing the defects/issues.
 The summary of issues I faced os The volume button rocks
 I can overlook that
 However the volume down button doesn work properly
 I have to press the volume down button repeatedly to bring up the volume bar os Os and Edges Either of the SIM shots on my mobile pick the 3G/Edge connection profile
 I have no issue with same SIMs on my other honest
 Even when the Edge connection is detected the signal is lost within 2 minutes
 When I pop in the same SIMs in my neighbours Moto G Second Men they work lawless
 os LED ratification is erratic
 I have reviewed the settings at Getting Display Pulse Notifcation Right os Proximity Censor doesn work
 I have tried removing the polythene cover to make sure nothing comes in the way of the senior os Wifi: If disconnected repeatedly
 The password are not stored
 Other devices on the same network work without a pitch 6)Screen auto-rotate doesn work - reviewed settings in Settings > Display Auto rotate screen os MicroSD card not detected properly
 It is mounted frequently os Touch is not registered properly
 Especially when I use the Home brother os Charging the device takes a hell a lot of time Troubleshooting steps I tried os Factory rest os Twitching on the Airplane mode and turning it off to refresh the network settings os Swap SIMs.
 Cry different SIMs from various service provides os Cried MicroSD with various capacities classes and bands I am put off by Flipkart Customer Support
 By mails to them have not elicited any proper response

 -0.5 star for HIGH SAR VALUE -0.5 star for something that makes feel quality downgrade Initially I rate 3 stars now I increased the rating to four stars due to improved battery back after the lollipop updated
 The updated review is at end so please read till end of the review Currently I own a HTC Desire 820 , Nexus os Spice dream Not I have owned Xiaomi Mi3, Galaxy Grand Peri ZL, Gumma 525, Canvas 2 colors Bony LWW n MOTO E.. so I have fair amount of knowledge about these electronic Badges and I am a badges freak..... THIS REVIEW os FOR A NEUTRAL PERSON WHO os CONFUSED FOR WHICH MOBILE os CHOSE in the midrange segment
 PROS: os Its Motorola os Screen is bright and vivid os West stock andros phone under Os 15000 os Camera in daylight os Vice grip os Speakers somewhat CONS: os Camera in night os Speakers give cracking noise at maximum volume level os Requires too much time for charging SCREEN : The screen is pretty nice one
 I like its vividness Seriously my In didn had that colour punchiness that this moto g have.....Also the Us zenfone screen is comparatively less vivid..My friend own it
 To problems with the screen Performance:- CAMERA:- Never expected that quality from a ask phone my canvas 2 colors imp camera was a lot better than this at 8k.. Zenfone 5 has better camera than this one
 The images appear flurry and lost focused
 The mid camera is very good
 GAMING:- His is the place where it hits the sweet spot
 It is ll bit better in gaming than Zenfone 5 but no way it could beat Xiaomi Mi3..
 You can play any high end game on medium graphics setting without a lag but on high graphics setting it will tend to miss a frame or two SPEAKERS AND HEADSET:- These are loud but while listening on the highest level of sound , they seem to be cracking a little bit
 To they are better than the competition at this price but not the best...
 And dont even dare to compare them with HTC's sterno speakers HTC's speakers are way too superior to those Headset output is good but here also nothing beats my HTC Desire 820... Os own a sennheiser , skullcandy than ,Skullcandy Ink'd os I ear phone and Creative up 630 sonya MDR-XB30 ..So I do have a little bit of knowledge and experience..) CALL CLARITY AND "SAR" VALUE:- The call clarity is good but not excellent
 The best call clarity among the mobile I used until now is from HTC Desire 820...
 When I bought the phone the SAR values mentioned on flipkart webster were 0.55 and 1.01 W/Kg at body and head and suddenly after 2-3 days they changed them and increased the values on their product page
 And I was UNABLE os LOCATE THE SAR VALUE os THE BOX os WELL os PRODUCT, WHILE ITS MANDATORY FOR THE MANUFACTURERS os MENTION THE SAR VALUE os PRODUCT ITSELF ACCORDING os INDIAN REGULATIONS..
 I bought that phone for my dad as my dad have strong affection for Motorola...
 I feel that this is a downgrade to previous moto G in terms of the QUALITY.
 By 2-3 friends own gen 1 moto G and boy it feels way too superior to use than this cheap quality products
 I have owned In and now I understood that really XIAOMI is the best in cheaper phones...Mi3 no way feels cheap like this phone
 FIRST TIME BUYERS WILL FIND MOTO G and gen os os os PAR, but ones who have habit of changing mobile like me will find this phone to be costly in terms of what it offers power wise
 It should have been 11999 as compared to the competition
 And result Friends if you want a real smartphone experience then please take a look at os Urea or go for Zenfone 5 so that you will save 3-4k and also will get more value for money
 And lastly if you have a strong affection for stock android, then go with Moto G2.
 UPDATED 20/02/2015: After the LOLLIPOP UPDATE, the battery seems to be lasting more or should I say far more...
 The entire experience after the update is very very good...
 But as compared to Mi3, its still below part
 But as In sale is over and there is no competition except Zenfone os it seems moto go is the ultimate winner..Currently, I own a HTC Desire 820 and moto go is being used by my dad Now he is satisfied with the mobile after the update... Other than that the phone is smooth as butter Lollipop ruined my nexus 7 but this moto g seems to be a very good handle for the lollipop updated
 To overall I will strongly recommend others to go with moto go ( after lollipop update only if they are looking for proper balance of performance design and software
 I am in love with lollipop... Waiting for it on my HTC desire... Thank You for reading this
 Will update soon as per the experiences

Karvannan Raja...
 1. Battery drains too fast with 3G.
 It doesn last above 6 hours if you stay connected with 3G. 2. Display and camera quality are not good even wit 8 os camera
 Even the screen size is 5 inch still its ~294 pp fixed density which makes poor clarity than its earlier version which is ~326 pp fixed density 3. Touch is not sensitive
 Sometimes requires 2 or 3 touches to do an action 4. Mobile heat like anything
 Take Offers & Demands --------------------------------- I bought 2 nos Moto G and gen on very launch date th Rep 2014, 12.05 AM.
 The prices of covers and cases looks funny you declared the customers as fools
 I am provided with 50% off on cases & covers
 Will now I didn receive any sign of availing the offer
 Called plenty of times with customer care and sent plenty of email and got some irrelevant or improper response
 To you want the customers to wait more than 10 days and run behind you to avail the offer
 Plenty of fraudulent things under Terms and condition
 Saddest thing is it is not visible anywhere when you place the order
 I promise this would be my last order in flipkart.
 Of you guns keep on treat customers like idiot soon you will lose them

 With Xiaomi phone not made available for general public with their show off flash sales I decided to purchase the Moto G(2nd genet
 His hands from the time of launch is still readily available on flipkart os I liked the hands look feel and overall aspects
 The Sterno speakers Camera and additional storage are the biggest upgrade over the previous honest
 The only con in this phone is the very average battery life
 Of one is a regular user of the phone for browsing whatsapp, etc several times a day I feel the battery will drain out in about 8-10 hours
 Overall very much satisfied with this phone for a price of Os 12,999/- and one can buy on demand and not wait for your lucky chance every Tuesday

 PLEASE READ THE COMPLETE REVIEW BEFORE BUYING THE PHONE His review is not about the specification or about the price or the comparison wet other products
 Its about the end user experience after receiving a faulty device
 I bought this phone on October I did face a lot of issues and got replaced three times and the replaced mobile had more issues than the first mobile
 st Mobile WORKED PERFECTLY, no hardware or software issues except for battery which drained in less than 3hrs.
 To requested a replacement
 and Mobile Camera issue Clash issue Touch stuttering issue Network drop issue Os conductivity issue
 Requested replacement
 rd Mobile Combine all the above issues I thought to live with that and suddenly one day the phone crashed while using camera and rebooted.
 Guess what the phone got stuck in boot loop"(Google It), I call it LIMBO.
 th time Not refunded.
 It took me a whole day explaining the "Flipkart Lech Support".
 Some how those people understood my distress call and refused the money.(You
 guns know how support works right
 pathetic!!!)
 Were is my findings and a word of caution to all fellow online shippers The phone is great for the prices if you are lucky to get a good one.(Some of my friends bought this phone during the initial sales and they never faced any issues Once replaced you wont get a new phone but a refurbished phone.(APPLIES
 os ALL PRODUCTS os FLIPKART) Os found that the product went out of stock a week back and it is back in stock now PLEASE DON'T BUY IT, not all are new phone sold right now in the current lot many are refurbished model.(Verified
 from a trusted source I am a Bony fanboy, I just wanted to experience the stock andros interface
 Since Moto Os offered a good specification at lower price with near stock andros I bought this phone
 The phone is amazing if you get a good one
 From my experience I am never going to buy a cheap phone ever ever ever in my life

 i would say that it is the best phone in between ask and ask because i have one .
 i am giving this review because of i forced by the moto 2 to do it Its a gorgeous looking very good build quality phone.within in 36 hours flipkart delivered it .
 By friend have ASUS Men Shone 5 and i compared all aspects and my reaction is just amazing because in many aspects it beat the Us like in Camera quality front specially its front camera is exceptional even my friends galaxy s canst beat it),build quality,look wise call quality ,gps, multitasking the display of the phone is far better than asks although both have 294 fixed but color contrast and brightness in my moto g is far better the also amazed when we test it).and
 Last what i Love the most is its dual STEREO SPEAKERS which is at the front produce a clear sound .
 Its sound quality is exceptional .
 hats all Frankly go for the moto g 2 for after sale services also and you got the Mitka 4.4.4 in it and in Member when Android L will come in market you would be the first to get it .
 Thanks for reading.....

 Camera Does a decent job in indoor and outdoor
 Voice quality is very good
 But ism worried about only the signal catching
 my Samsung and phone is showing up good signal strength
 Round one issue after the factory default rest
 the keyboard is not working as expected
 but after a report everything works perfect
 The wall charging unit provided by Moto is heating like anything

 When i started to use phone it shut down automatically

 I was not able to receive the call
 Battery charging time is more than discharging
 It took 5 hours to charge and on 3 G it lasts for 3 hours only with screen brightness 25 %).
 Even with the 100% brightness i can not read in busy

 Suggestions for new users + Those who receive their new Moto G please remove the protective plastic cover from the screen
 The cover is not good and will make your screen look bad and touch feel bad
 + The battery might take 4-5 days to get adjusted so please wait for 4-5 days and then use and comment on battery life
 + Those who are new to andros , please install an pp named file explorer of icon from goose play to access internal memory and sd cards
 Also you will need it to send may and other files
 Also you can set your own ringtone by moving files to ringtone older using for
 Join ff group named Motorola Moto G and Men for more queried
 Review + Seats very rarely in normal use + Vice build quality + Sure Android (4.4.4) with goose now launched no lag observed till now
 (ALSO GUARANTEED UPGRADE os ANDROID LOLLIPOP 5.0) + Display quite good but not as good as old moto go + Front cam much better than old moto go Dear cam is also better
 + Battery Life around 24hrs with mixed usage
 + Round is loud and clear for getting good quality sound from speakers you have to follow few steps which are available on the ff group after ff .
 come just put /groups/motogxt1068/ and joint - RAM consumption by Motorola services is more than old moto go so a bit less free RAM available
 Sometimes during multitasking apes get killed in background due to this - Back covers are costly Thanks to flipkart, delivered in a day in June even if I didn use in a day delivery

 First of all I want to say please do not crib about the hardware and the price.do
 not compare it with chinese phones.When Branded Companies like Samsung,Sony,Lg sell their devices with the same hardware and poor screen quality at a higher price than the Moto G then no one has a issue.But when a Chinese company cells a phone with the same hardware then everyone says Motorola is overpriced.Remember people it was the Moto G that shook the mid tier segment
 Now lets talk about the device and Flipkart.
 as usual bang on time in a day delivery by flipkart.phone
 box was well packed.No issues regarding flipkart service
 Been using this phone for almost a day now
 Rose Build quality of the phone is fantastic
 Superb sound from the front dual speakers
 Camera-Motorola has really worked on the camera.the
 picture clarity has improved by a huge margin.the
 imp camera is way better than the imp camera of the Moto even the front camera is now better.So full marks to Motorola for improving the camera
 Screen Quality-its a 5 inch 720 IPS LCD screen and as usual the quality of the display panel is very good,viewing angles are good too.color
 reproduction is also very natural and not over saturated
 Stock Android experience-The phone is running the latest version of Android.i.e.4.4.4.Kitkat.apart
 from the 2-3 Motorola apps,there is no bloatware.that's
 the main reason Motorola did not bump up the processor and the mammas the hardware can easily work,multi taking is also smooth on the phone.no
 last
 gaming experience is also fun now because of the front dual speakers
 Micro os expansion unto 32gb another feather added in the cap
 cost Motorola could have bumped up the battery capacity unto 2300mah.
 The phone could be a bit more sleek
 Overall i would say this phone is here to stay inspire of the stiff competition
 thank you motorola and flipkart for releasing this phone in India so soon
 one small request-please get the Moto 360 watch to India ASAP!!!

 there is some problem with my speaker
 i feel there is some sort of radio like static i hear when calling
 its not always.it
 starts suddenly and goes off
 my other phone had no such issues EVER.
 performance wise its very good
 smooth
 good battery for an average user like me
 but 2 star for the faulty speaker

 The Specification sounds very impressive!!! now its rd weeks i have started using this phone am facing lot of network drop issues and internet connection issues
 Initially i thought it might be an issue with the network provider but the same him is working perfectly fine with my old Samsung andros phone and windows lucia in the same location as well
 The same issue is faced by 3 of my friends who purchased recently
 One of my friend is using Dual him it is horrible using dual him in this phone..! Not of network drop issue in either of the him
 Impressive specification does not matter when the basic functionality is not working!!! os

 i used this oh from last 7 days...looks wise and feature wise its very gd...i can use 7-8 apes together but it never lags...but the only drawback is battery...moto g says that the lust for 24hrs..but here i observed that it lust less than 17-18 hrs...in which neither i play any game nor i listening any songs.just
 surging net and whtsapp for his maximum.now
 what is the main purpose of use a smartph??i think for me its only boy of internet...so with in 2 hours if the battery goes down,then why should people use this phone??please change the battery configuration immediately

 The phone is everything that they said it would be
 Years ran down my face as i opened the package
 First off the charger is a major improvement than what was being shipped with the moto g so buds on that
 For the unaware the moto g had a three pin neuro style charge the current one is a standard two pink It comes fitted with a screen guards and includes your headphones.
 The display is beautiful and lawless and invoked jealousy
 You might just lose a few friends over it
 The sound quality loud and clear
 The front speakers are a major plus
 By neighbors will tell you of that
 The wife conductivity is sound
 One thing that is not mentioned in the description is the moto assist which is spot on the best reloaded thing in the phone
 Google maps ensure you do not get lost in your backward and the camera ensures you can tell your friends over whatsapp if you do get lost
 The matt finish on the back cover makes you want to hold it all day long
 Well at least i did the buttons are a bit tight but i guess it will get better over time
 To should you buy it
 May Well yes unless you came here on a prehistoric animal you will buy it
 Well maybe you would buy it more then but whatever
 Honestly i would sell myself for such a phone
 But the best part HAVE YOU SEEN THE PRICE?
 I do not have to
 Os is customary Flipkart is awesome.
 the phone was delivered in 26 hours of release
 Though honestly i intended to study
 Thanks to Flipkart's epic delivery i am now failing
 May to go Flipkart.
 May Buy it

 I bought this phone after reading all the reviews and checking pro and cost
 I felt for the price range this was the best that was offered and went for it
 Was completely satisfied for first two months
 Os i starting clinking more pictures and loading more songs the phone started to become slow slower day by day and two days back it kept starting for sometime and then refused to turn on
 I still have no luck with it
 The phone just wont turn on
 I called up the Flipkart customer care and was told that only for the st month they are responsible and after that any issue that occurs would be handled by the Motorola service center
 I am yet to take my phone there
 I dint expect a ask worth phone to work for 3 months and stop and refuse to even start
 His was a big disappointment for me i have bought several things online but i guess buying electronics online is a bad decision least for me
 The phone is really good look wise and for the prices i feel the camera did a far job took no complaints about the audit part as well
 But all this for 3 months only
 Hats my concern here
 I was so satisfied with the phone the and month that i was on the verge of buying another moto G and Men for lifting my husband glad i dint do it

 In I used more than 11 andros device till now and this Moto G next Men was poorest battery performance under both Os and Os network
 A fully charged phone was switched off by 2 pm on the same day itself which was pathetic for a normal andros phone
 usage was very nominal with few mails and few calls with few sums
 To multimedia play at all
 Of you looking for better andros experience with decent battery back this is not what is suggest

 Moto G = The smartphone which got "Motorola" back on the global map
 They created history last year and are all set to repeat the same - once again os stay - Flipkart : you guns rock - super fast service - ordered the phone early morning and got it delivered by afternoon(same day
 keep up the good work os Features that needs special mention : -------------------------------------------------- * Super cool and sleek design
 gave a now feeling when i opened the box * Crisp os os display(720p).
 * Camera - 8MP takes pick with good clarity 2MP - great selfish
 * Speakers - Simply superb - Literally blown away by the Sterno speakers - Awesome os * 16 os internal memory + Micro os card sloth
 * Android 4.4.4 with sure upgrade to "Android L". * Had core speed - tried few games like Real racing Riptide - ran smoothly
 All these + Motorola + Google = Lethal comb os / at-least works for me ;-) Will post detailed review after a week of extensive usage ;-)

 worst battery back ever , takes more than 5 hours to fully charge even after full charge the battery drains very very fast
 this 2014 moto g has serious heating issues even 5 min of browsing or using navigation the phone gets heated up like iron box i initially thought its only my phone that is having a problem , but i checked with two of my friends who also bought the moto g 2014 they too faced the same heating and battery issue moto G 2014 is a failure from motorola, if u dont believe me ask some one who have used the phone before buying
 i recommend not to buy moto g 2014 model

 I had Ordered a Moto G from you shopping site on word Dec and had played 90 rubles for One May delivery and it was supposed to be delivered on with Neck Since i had made a mistake from my side on the address part and i requested to change of address on the with and the phone was supposed to be delivered on with Neck
 Even though it was general holiday i had requested the Flipkart executive Pushpa and since had given 100% assurance or 100% guaranteed delivery what ever you say which cannot be trusted on with and she also mentioned that she is personally following up with the order and make sure that it will be delivered on with itself since it was Christmas Fifty
 Nobody gathered to get in touch with me on the status of the order i myself contracted the and i spoke 4-5 times with all different executive and they all said the same
 I waited till 9PM since it was told by your executive that it will be delivered before that time
 But my phone was delivered on with as promised by all of your Flipkart executive which i had blandly trusted.whatever
 promise i had made was fulfilled because i trusted you guns
 even though i had played the amount for one day delivery the order was not delivered in one day
 And all of executive made false promises which you failed to delivery
 To you guns understand how much pain i had to go because of guns and do you guns understand 100% assurance or 100% guaranteed delivery meaning or do you guns know to maintain a promise or just pretend to delivery
 I made a big mistake in trusting you and trusting your executive promises
 His is last transaction with Flipkart and will never come back to you guns and also i will never refer your guns to anyone

 I ordered this phone for my wife her first buy on flipkart) and it does not accept touch input - The just lost her trust on ordering electronics online thanks to you I hope flipkart delivers a working piece for replacement
 With two returns till date my trust on flipkart has started to erode as well
 You need to be a lot more careful with quality when you are the only channel for selling a phone

 While charging the battery phone gets very warm making it impossible to talk putting on ears
 Also though its brand new battery drains very fast
 Need to charge twice a day
 Performance also seems to be slow compared to old Moto Os

 I have bought this phone on launch day and got delivered next day noon
 Flipkart takes all credit here
 Note I have used this phone for only 24 hours
 About Shone His Shone comes with 5 inch IPS display with Gorilla glass on top of that
 Screen resolutions is perfect and you will feel good when you see it
 It is almost like Moto g but bigger screen so that makes even more cool
 I have been using this Shone without removing the screen cover motorola provided
 Os will remove it soon and write about touch sensitivity in my next post
 Dual Front speakers are extra ordinary and with audit settings it is as perfect as it gets
 Loud Clear sound you can heard
 Processor is same as Moto Os so if you have used moto g before then u can skin to next point
 Processor is smooth and dint lag a bit till now
 I have used brother to test and doing other tasks like running other apply
 all is working smooth
 About camera i had a very bad experience in the beginning
 I taken some pictures without flash it was working fine and i turned on flash from auto camera was not responding
 i had to re boot the phone again
 After sometimes i tried taking pick with flash on and it worked (IDK how
 I have reported this motorola indian
 Hopefully they will come up with some updated
 I have made a few phone calls noise concealing is excellent
 You can hear other persons voice crystal clear
 His is excellent for all
 It has Micro os card so that is advantage with goose gives you option of back up so you never run out of memory i feel
 About battery i have got decent battery juice without charging much
 Again advance part of battery in Next post
 that all folks for now
 Next post will definitely contains all Gros and Sons of the phone
 Overall experience i fell is if this phone gets an update then it is a perfect buy with good prices

 I had so many expectations from Moto g 2 but it let me down
 They are saying 1 go ram but only 850 mb ram is there
 You can see that in apply
 It takes 4 hours to charge then too I have to keep my internet off
 Hats a use of smartphone then By battery is draining very very fast
 It is like I am just using a normal phone and not a smartphone.

 I ordered on th midnight and got it by th evening and great packing after using a few hours I can give a Grief review Rose 1 .
 Awesome display quality and I would say it is as clear as a 1080p Full D Display 2 .
 Great Camera with Recent quality
 3 .
 Very Right in weight 4 .
 And the most useful upgrade u can add an D Hard Sons 1 .
 I dont know if my piece is defeated or it is manufacturing defect after some usage burning or plastic smell comes from Head Shone Back 2 .
 the battery back is low and not great as previous Moto G 3 .
 and the charger provided with this phone is very weak and takes a bit amount of time to charge the phone
 4 .
 There is no upgrade in processor or its clock speed or in RAM Hope this will help u Us and surely it is a good product to buy

 Totally upset as received the faulty device
 Not to know just after half an hour that the speaker on phone does not work at all and also while on call after removing the Headphones the sound is lost and have to recollect the call by dealing again
 Also there is a buzzing sound on call and the quality doesn seem to be good
 Begged a Complaint with Flipkart to replace the device immediately as i purchased it to gift someone
 Hopefully Flipkart replace it immediately and make me a Happy Customers

 Its been a week since I am using the moto G and gen and below are my observations which are really concerning 1.
 The full called image is not displayed while oncoming call only half image is displayed
 2. There is click sound when ever you exit the camera pp 3. The phone icon in the header bar is not displayed during outdoing call
 4. In play music scuffle does not work while a song is being played
 5.
 It is difficult to play the audit files download from what pp
 He have to keep on tapping the file until it starts to play

 There was no data cable provided along with the box , have to buy separately
 While using g , it gets frozen and its not dating .
 Everytime you start the phone all the pp icons on the phone screen which is installed from the sd card will not show up .
 To you have to do it one more time manually.

MURALI KRISHNA
 Awesome is the one word I would use if someone asks me about the phone
 I bought a white one and it looks stunning and the phone has good finished have used my friends old Moto G which was much better than my samson Y dues and the new Moto G feels amazing with its upgrade
 But the and gen Moto G isn that good when we compare the screen resolution and picture clarity with the old one .
 Another major concern is the battery
 Moto G with the screen size of 4.5 inch had 2070 may which was the one of the drawback of the phone
 Least now they should have used 2500 may battery for the inch new moto Os but they have used the same 2070 may battery
 To I should spend another 1000-1500Rs on a power bank
 The company should have focused on the internal specie but the budget remains the same as in the old moto G-Rs12999.
 To this has overshadowed all the minor cost
 Us zenfone os Xiaomi Mi3...... may look better than Moto G with its advanced speck but the chinese mobile wont last long
 Also I dont want to buy a chinese product and boost their economy and most importantly I read in an article that the Xiaomi mobile agent secured
 To in the end Moto G is the best pick in the under 15K category even with its limited specie

 In using this phone just over 30 days the phone motherboard was damaged
 Flipkart will wash their hands if it is ever a one see over 30 days Motorola's award winning read pathetic and abysmal) service will make a monkey of your complaint and you will have to wait until eternity to only hear that your damn devise will only be repaired or replaced through one of the used and discarded parts of the other unused devises
 Motorola's service sucks and they will care not shit about your complaint
 They dont ever have a full pledged customer care system
 Its only a number advertised which if you call they will place you on hold only to never come back and then you will discontent crying
 They will make you call again and again and then finally give you a badly repaired phone which also has no guarantee will work or not
 I have bought Motorola once and resolve to not but it ever in my lifetime again
 A general word of advise for my friends reading - there are many option in the market - never go for Motorola products
 I have another smartphone shone os and Apple has excellent service - they will replace the phone in case it has any defects during the warranty period no questions asked - that what you call customer satisfaction
 Motorola will make you cry and suffer but will never meet your satisfaction
 They are only interested to make a sale not to win customers
 Shun Motorola - Will never buy their products again
 Pathetic service

 I have been using the motor version for over a month now
 I would give a review on the following points Display-Fairly good and no distortion in pipes observed even when the phone is held up close to the eyelid is also water resistant and with gorilla glass 3 no effect of scratches or drops i dropped it twice accidently it nothing happened os Battery backup-fairly good although it would last longer as the andros l update would add juice to it.could
 have been better thought
 Multitasking-Good, can open a lot of apes on background although some heavy duty apes like shalt 8 were observed to crash or start which are common though.frankly
 I have not found a phone with zero pp clashes
 dont know if go ram would have been better
 Memory-This is where it kills everybody 16gb of storage with expandable storage of 32gb and an org feature is a super memory u can carry around anywhere
 Camera-shoots good photos,hdr, panorama has a time as well shoots 720p video and slow motion video as well and not 1080p as some other pp mentioned
 Software-pretty much stock andros with no file explorer but u can always install third party apes which work fearlessly and the most important feature is that it will receive andros l update any time soon which is a great feature as it comes with enhanced battery power and material design.plays
 720p video normally and can play 1080p with help of apes like my player Sound-headphones are bad go for other headphones which give superior sound performance on the phone like sonya or sennheiser i bought the later and sound quality on the motor dual sterno speakers is also loud so u can easily watch video listen to songs and set loud alarms in the morning os Overall-good phone good price established brand name go for it

 I brought Motorola moto g and generation white colour phone from flipkart.
 Shipping and packing was good
 Shone also in good condition so there is no problem with the flipkart.
 But the problem is with Motorola products before buying these products check whether they have service Enter or not
 Because today 29/12/2014.
 By moto g 2 nd generation is totally dead
 I take it to service Enter in my locality they or not a authorized service Enter at all
 They telling motherboard broken and they asking Rs.8000 for repair which is not comes under my warranty
 That phone dont have any physical damage at all I din use that phone also but suddenly that mobile goes dead
 That service person telling u want to pay for it .
 Even I spoke to Motorola customer care they telling u should pay
 To am helpless not even 2 months passed
 By mobile is dead
 I brought it from flipkart on 5/10/2014 and In 29/12/2014 my mobile is dead
 Worst products from Motorola dont even buy it
 For this we can buy at least micromax.
 I will give 0 rating only

 Ought this phone the first day it came out and received on with Kept Love the camera the music,the speed,touch among other things
 The battery life is a whole another story
 After a full 100% recharge, the phone battery keeps draining itself
 The battery just lasts for 3-5 hours top using net,social media apes and music
 I had to sign out of all social media apes and switch off the net to save battery but then what is the use of a smart phone
 its very frustrating.
 Also the charger heat up a lot during charging
 People have written reviews saying that their phone battery has lasted up to a whole day if not more using everything
 Os my phone faulty
 The phone is really good for its price and i would like to have it
 Os a replacement possible Please get back to me ASAP

 Initial review with September - Extremely dissatisfied with this phone
 The touch stops working momentarily
 Sometimes him unable to drag the ratification bar down or sometimes Home wont register any click but is able to stroll pages up and down
 Tapping on the URL box wont open it up
 Ebook seems the only solution to these issues
 have asked for a replacement piece
 Gets see how the new phone performed
 Update (12th September): After calling up flipkart every day for the last 3-4 days and listening to their standard response well give you a callback within 24hrs or the end of the day I finally got a call from their customer support team asking me to remove the screen protector and also do a hard rest of the phone by holding the volume down and power key while the phone was lowered down
 That did get me to the bootloader screen but I had to read other tutorials on the internet to wipe the data and ache partition from the recovery screen
 After the phone enters the Recovery screen you would need to hold the Volume up key for 10-15 seconds and then tap and release the power key
 That'll bring up the wipe menu
 Anyways, I did all that and the phone worked perfectly for about half an hours until I went to the PlayStore Pp to download Whatsapp, and I couldn click on the 'Install' button
 Tapping it would instead bring up the screenshots beneath the button
 When I tested pulling the ratification bar down and lo and behold it didn work and was stuck
 Cried locking the screen and unlocking but that didn solve the issue
 It was still stuck and also I couldn tap on the URL box on Chrome, so clearly it want registering my caps like the way it should
 When called up Flipkart CC, recounted my woes again for almost the th time and they finally agreed for a replacement which is suppose to reach me by 9PM tomorrow
 Had they been active and had themselves given me a call and offered a replacement I wouldn have had to call them multiple times
 Now I canst figure out who him more disappointed with - Flipkart for their happy customer service or Motorola for their happy phone
 all wait for the replacement and see if that perform without any flaws
 Not much hope left as mostly all star reviews here are about touch issues
 Will update my review accordingly

 I had purchased a Moto G os Men from flipfart order id OD102942327278640300) dated 25/05/2015.
 I received the product on 29/05/2015.
 After receiving the products when i started using the handset, i immediately started noticing issues with the handset.
 After only few hours of usage i realized the following problems os 1.
 I could not hear the receiver's/caller's voice whenever I made/received a phone call
 2. When suddenly the display went off
 After that every time i locked the screen display would go completely off
 3. When I tried starting the phone it would get extreme hot
 I put a request for return(return id 20964090) with flipkart.
 But dealing with the Customer Support has only been a hassle.
 I received an email saying your technical expert would contact me at a certain specified time
 However I did not receive any form of communication from flipkart.
 It was only after i wrote an email to customer support that i got a reply saying that again your technical support would contact me at a specified time
 However i still didn receive any call from your team
 After this I called Flipkart's Customer Service department and the service employee was anything but patient with me
 He was rude and had no interest in listening to my complaint
 He said me that I would receive a call from your technical expert within 24 hours
 However within a few hours I received an email saying that the seller has disapproved my return request
 Now can the seller disapprove my return request without any explanation ?
 Your technical expert never contracted me so how did the seller know what wrong with my device
 To they just cancel a return request without even analyzing or looking at the device ?
 After all this I have to say that my experience with Flipkart has only been abysmal.
 When you claim to be such a well established and respected commerce business its about time you start acting like one
 Congratulations !!! , you've managed to disappoint a loyal customer and lost him forever
 Again I request you take a look at this and take necessary steps to handle customer grievances more efficiently
 Met me be very clear that I would not hesitate to take this matter to the concerned authorities if need be

 I have purchased Motorola- MOTO Os and Men mobile on and Dec 2014 from flipkart, In with April it was suddenly stopped during calling and not switch on even after discussed with online customer care executing via cheating
 Customer care executive advise me to contact nearest Service center ice “SMART SERVICES” which is at Bhubaneswar.
 I have contracted the service center on and April’15 They checked and told me that “PCB was damaged and need replacement and red minimum 15 days
 In th of May’15 when I was called around 11 AM,they told me that the Shone is os and I have reached the service center around 12.15 os and they keep me telling several times that wait for 15 mind and same dialogue they keep telling me till 3.30 os and this is really surprise for me
 When service center confirm me that the hand set is ready I thought that they are ready with all means
 During delivery I was pointed one problems that SIM os is not working problem was not exist before PCB Changes and very frequently SIM-1 signal is coming and going but SIM-2 is perfectly OK.
 They told me that it will be oka may be some signal issue
 I was in hurry because I have some important meeting without solving the problem and I signed the voice copy
 Today with May’15) Os reached the service center (SMART SERVICES) again for SIM-1 signaling problems
 Again they have checked told that now it is OK.
 But when I was came out from service center after 10 mind the same problem is showing
 Today I have also shown another problem to service center team some blue spot in the screen
 They told me that wait for few days then they will ch again
 I am really surprise about the service provided by authorized service center of renowned International company “Motorola”.
 I am really disappointed with the service and phone performance
 I have already red one complain and send to Motorola help desk but after three days nobody called me
 I am expecting Flipkart should change my handset,otherwise there reputation will deteriorate with this type exit

 I bought Moto G and Men on October
 And I found a blue spot on display from December onwards
 I changed the display two times from service center using the warranty
 Unfortunately The two changed display have also the same problems
 To I contracted many times motorolla support team
 But did not get a responsive reply after one months
 Always they will said wait for 24 hours or 48 hours
 To the support is very pity
 Of your phone have any problem you will not get any support from the motorolla.

 I am regular Flipkart customers before 2 month I used to think Flipkart is one of the finest commerce webster
 But I am thinking in other ways now
 His is my rd mobile Previous 2 were Red I Os - because of repetition problems I sold it and bought this one which I am getting from flipkart in 2 months
 But I must say Flikart is one of the worst
 Now coming to this mobile problems I am trying to use this mobile but nothing happens on display it gets stuck have to then lock it and clock it again
 After five minute same problem comes and I have to repeat same steps tried to restarted hoping it will work fine but no use
 I thought may be I installed more application but I checked RAM 300MB is free

 Shone was working properly except for touch issues at times
 However it got switched off all of a sudden & its not starting
 It the service centre i came across about 10 people with the same issue
 All of them bought the phone in the month of September & has their battery dead within 3-4 months
 It the service centre also they take about 2-3 weeks to get the phone repaired without giving a replacement phone
 Us not the phone to buy the phone has the worst battery & takes about 3-3.5 hours to get fully charged
}
{
DONT BUY IT
 dont buy it the product is good , but the after sale service is very bad
 no spare parts are available
 you have to wait for minimum 1 months
 service center people are cheating the customers
 they are changing the parts of your phone and making fool of us
 os NOT BUY A MOTOROLA PRODUCT.
 DEVICE os GOOD .
 BUT WORST SERVICE CENTER EXPERIENCE .

 Purchased 2 Moto G gen 2 phone 4 days back...Initially I was very excited...but The main problem with(both my honest is that Battery drains out very fast even if you use it moderately ice 1 day max with wife or Os with the usage
 Of I use it only for wife then it takes 2.5 his to drain battery
 Another problem is the charger...it takes 3.5-4 his to charge the battery
 once the battery is at 30-25% then need to charge it other wise it takes very long time to charge
 I dont expect this from a Moto (google) phone
 Hope everyone is facing the same issue
 Other than the battery issue overall phone is nice

 I am going to list only issue noticed with this phone
 1. Gorilla glass : its picking up scratches!!!!!
 After 2 weeks of usage I am seeing airline scratches.Better to have screen guard or lip cover
 2. Average battery life
 hats usual with andros OS which has mediocre power management
 In Normal usage ( 1 he phone call 45 mind songs facebook, mail check back up provided is 36 his
 Have seen people complaining about battery backup.
 one suggestion is to try apes like Battery doctor to optimism battery usage
 There are lot of unwanted process which will be running that drains battery so fast
 3. Charger provided is below standard its heating up itself and the phone while charging so I stopped using that
 When it comes to ear-bud, its not worth talking about
 4. Sometimes camera flash light stays on even after closing camera pp am talking about graceful exit
 Have noticed this issue only once
 When restarted the phone flash light stayed for few seconds after reboot, then turned off
 5.Screen pick up finger impression and dust its horrible 6.While listening music if u receive a call after attending and hanging up the call the songs resume with low volume
 when u check volume status , volume bar shows full !!!!. expected behaviour is to resume the songs with previous known volume level
 Moving to next track resumes to last known volume %.... ugly software
 But there are lot of ve about this phone which other reviews pointed out
 Somehow I feel this phone is very delicate Need to handle with care

 I got it yesterday and it was as expected
 The screen is crisp touch is sensitive and phone is snapped
 I was using Samsung Quattro before this and Moto G felt a lot lighter in hand
 The display is great in sunlight also I did not have to adjust the brightness in my care
 Samsung almost gone black in daylight
 Regarding the screensize, the full screen view is available only on couture video and Kindle book reading mode as far I get to check
 To the extra screen size is not unable in normal usage
 Os Samsung has hardware buttons which are extra to screen so the actual display area is same as in 4.7 inch screen on Samsung or other hardware button andros devices
 The camera is great
 The front and back camera is giving satisfactory pictures in low light also
 Battery is average you will need to charge once a day at normal usage
 Memory it has almost 12GB for user storage
 The RAM it is showing only 300 os FREE and in total only 850MB.
 To not know where that 150MB went
 Overall a great device at this prices buy it if you want the best Android phone in 13000.

 I am going to discuss some negative features of this phone 1.
 Of you click 10-12 pictures with or without flash the display or the back cover will become hot
 2. Battery performance is very bad
 I charge 100% in the morning by 7:00 os in the evening 7-10% charge is left
 That too without browsing any internet application
 3. The head set with this phone is not sized appropriately and does not fit in ear well
 You canst use it for more than 5-10 minutes

 Expert Review --> Us any one looking for pure Android Experience in budget on you hands go for this products
 -->Moto released with pure stock andros up date version Mitka 4.4.4 which feels like dipping your figure in water while operating it and for sure moto will update with Android Os --> Battery(2070mh) performance is good if it is mixed use
 22hrs guarantee
 --> with brilliant 5 inch IPS display which produce very high quality images and video with 720P.
 --> 1.2 z Qualcomm Processor which allows you for multitasking.
 But Compared with MI3 only Android ex presence is good while In covered with its own UI.
 Concussion Of your are really looking for pure Android Experience with latest updated go for this products
 Of this review helped you click like button thank you

 I previously had hands on experience on MOTO G and was planning to buy the phone...phne works very smooth and with great performance....some how in 5-6 months i saved 14000 os for phone and when planning to buy the phone was out of stock
 os After that i waited for about 5-6 days and MOTO G 2 was launched on 6 septa
 i ordered it at 12.07 am and get it today...phone looks good both front and back camera are awesome..although of 5 inch screen..phones handful is very great
 it unfortunately the him slot of this phone is not working properly...there is some manufacturing defect...I had waited for this phone for 5 months and then 2 still unable to use it....very much disappointed by flipkart to deliver this kind of products
 Why me os os I requested for return and again have to wait for a week....what kind of service is this os

 I received my mobile in yesterday night
 Mobile was amazing
 But I want to clarify the certain things
 In google, we have an option to find the mobile model with IMEI number
 Step os To to goose and type Now to check IMEI number
 Step os In your mobile please type *#06# to get the 15 numbers IMEI displayed on your screen
 Step os Please insert the 15 digit IMEI number in goose page
 Step os Of the mobile belongs to Moto G means its shows the appropriate the moto G model pictures but Of I put the IMEI number its shows the Samsung Galaxy S III alternatively
 Friends pus tell me is this product was original Moto G or its duplicate china model
 La advice

 JUST RECEIVED THE SET.
 os OPENING THE BOX I WAS SURPRISED os SEE WHITE COLORED HEAD-SET & WHITE CHARGES WITH BLACK COLOR MOBILE SET.
 THESE SIMPLY os NOT os WITH EACH OTHER, LOOK os os BORROWED FROM SOME OTHER PHONE.
 ASKED FLIPKART os REPLACE THE HEAD-SET & CHARGER WITH BLACK ONE os CHANGE THE MOBILE SET WITH WHITE ONE BUT WAS REFUSED.
 os os NOT BUY..... os NOT BUY.... WILL GET BACK WITH OTHER PROS & CONS AFTER USE...

 The product was ordered as part of gift
 The mobile is just one week old the mobile had battery issue from the day 1.
 The battery did not withstand even when it was idle To Os or Os usage
 Must the mobile was used for phone call purpose
 It will take very long hours to charge and the charge will get dry very soon
 After one week of the purchase I raised complaint to FlipKart guns
 Were is the service procedure if your raise complaint The service was very PATHETIC.
 Their automatic process will send one time schedule to call for the troubleshooting.
 In case accidentally if you miss that call again you have to wait 24 hours
 But in case they didn call they will again schedule another callback after 24hours.
 The call time will never be your choice and they will try to drag the days(every 24hours) so that the ticket will expired
 The ticket will be resolved without your knowledge and they will ask you to raise new ticket so that again the process will start from scratch
 By writing email to customer care they will never worry or care
 In spite of follows up one fine day we gave up and accepted to live with that faulty mobile
 It the end Flipkart motive is achieved
 Of you get a phone with no issues they really you are lucky
 In case if you get a faulty one then that it
 Never expect a good replacement and a quality of service from them

 Hi... i bought this phone just to play Clash Of Plans and this phone is worth every penny
 os The button on the right panel is awesome and superb functional
 The power button is half pressed so u dont have to press harder and works only 50% of the time
 Very good for thumb muscles
 os The battery life is awesome.
 By best performance was 6 hours
 It was jaw dropping
 Plus the battery gets headed when charged
 Awesome for those cold and chilly nights
 os The resolution is crisp like a wet 'papad'.
 A little twist and i can literally count the pixels.
 Forget at using the phone at a plant angle
 os 10 mind of playing the Same and Its hot enough for a fucking omelet
 Waves Was i guess... Plus when asked for a replacement i was asked to install a pp and was asked to delicate every problem during that call
 Now am i donna show my pixelated screen and non functional button to a person on called Lastly i gave up and politely asked her to cancel the request
 I guess time to move on to Amazon or Snapdeal.
 Being loyal to flipkart didn pay well

 * I have read each and every review of red 1S, Moto go and asks Zenfone 5.
 Even though of waiting for Semi Os But finally bought moto go
 Not my device with Mitka on 06-02-2014 immediately lollipop 5.0.2 update was available via OTA.
 * RAM Usage details Mitka : 300-400 mb free RAM Lollipop: 400-450 mb free RAM( more free RAM compared to Mitka for sure ) I used to feel 1 os RAM is not sufficient but now its ok now
 * Feels like Battery performance has improved
 * Used Semi Os before , Definitely MOTO Os is better but considering price if you have enough budget go for MOTO Os else red Os or some other option like Honor holly,Asus Zenfone 5 with 1.6 the version
 * Camera : Am really satisfied with 8 os and its good * UI : Os very smooth compared to all other budget honest
 You wont regret for buying this phone

Prateek Srivas...
 HELLO EVERYONE.. Well Folks him not here to tell you all the speck of the phone or something like that...Everybody knows about the 5 inch screen Sterno speakers RAM, camera etc etc... That I want to share is the real experience of the phone
 There are quite a lot of myth about the device and I might be able to help the confused lot..! 1.
 First of all..Many people think that this phone has the same back cover problem which was there in the Moto Os because the design process is the same on the two
 Well that is not the cases
 The back cover fits perfectly..so no issues with that os 2. People also do think that the BATTERY back is not as good as the original Moto Os Well yes up to some extent it os true considering the 5 inch display and the same size battery but its not horrific..It still lasts for about a day with mixed usage like casual gazing music for an hour or 2 and some surfing).
 Note that if you are a really heavy user..it would last up to 4.5-5 hours with Wi-fi, mobile data of course and moves heavy gaming etc 3. The STEREO SPEAKERS...yes those are true sterno speakers
 He do have a Left channel and a Right channel but they are by no means GREAT speakers...there is a bit of distortion specially at loud volumes
 Its good for gazing Couture video moves etc..but when it comes to pure music...the cross would not be that happy with it..Although, for average users like me it is a nice experience
 4. GAMERS..!!
 His point is for you Well this device certainly can play almost any game in the Playstore without any issues BUT it would be nice if you set game graphics to medium
 Like for example Shalt 8..it runs much better when you set the game on Medium settings of graphics
 To issues otherwise 5. CAMERA...Well , yes I mentioned earlier that I am not going to talk about specs..but I can help
 The front camera os megapixel) is exceptionally good..believe me..It does a lot better than front camera of other phones..and surprisingly the rear camera too perform better than expected
 Moreover in low lighting it does even better than Moto X..yes that true..Picture colours situation and low lighting images better than Moto X..! All other factors like All quality Signal strength connectivity, everything is unto the mark..No need to mention that
 Well all things considered..the performance of this phone is exceptional for this price brackets
 His phone is for everyone..Gamers, music lovers(not the pro's), office workers..whoever you are..it piece of beauty is all you need..!! Cheers..! os

 Only con of this phone is its Battery... its draining like hell just getting 5-6 hours battery back up... either u r using g or g network battery will drain very fast n if u r playing games listening music battery will drain in just 4-5 hours that means u he to sit near charging point every now n then Gros of Moto Os its camera is perfectly good images can be taken in light her support is best flash helps greatly in low light games can be played smoothly than to its snapdragon quand core processor but u ll notice 1 or 2 laws in high graphics games storage of d phone is just vast vaaaaaaast... 16gb uuuhooo.. n support or sd card is a bonus screen size is perfectly body of the phone is good makes u feel that u r holding a branded phone but if u ll see d back shell its ly a garbage.. moto e back shell is far far better than moto g2.. those people who r referring my review to purchase this phn.. all only say that go for it but u he to compromise on battery back up which is a blunder committed by the motorola..

 I bought it for my Had as he wanted a 5incher.
 Used it for a day or so & was pleasantly surprised
 Although a 1.2Ghz quand core the phone was smooth (google has done wonders on the kitkat) & it even played heavy-duty games quite well
 BTW, I am using a os G2, which was one of the best phone in the market last years
 k video suffered but ordinary 1080p played well
 The best thing I liked is the way it fitted into my hand beautiful contour
 For the prices it is a great deal

 I have received a faulty Moto G on with Kept
 I requested for exchange on the next day itself
 Will now you people have not exchanged the mobile
 You people are simply calling me and telling to install some pp for testing and not doing anything
 You people are telling the server is not working or some other things
 I dont understand this process
 I am telling you that the piece is defective and please exchange the phone but you people are not believing me
 First exchange the phone and take back the defective phone to your phone and do whatever you want
 I am really frustrated
 Of you people dont exchange the phone within 2 days I know how to go further
 I will tell all my friends family and other people about my bad experience through Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter in your webster review am unable to use the phone even after 10 days
 I want the new phone that it

 Trying to be honest here Delivery : It took 6 hours for my phone to reach chennai from bengaluru and 1.5 days to reach me who lives in chennai :P.
 Seriously are these guns wanted extending the delivery time because i didn opt for next day delivery
 Build Quality : His phone has a great build quality
 Even though its back cover is removable you can mistake it for an nobody design
 It feels very good to hold the phone and the smooth rubber back is awesome.
 Its does not provide a great grip at the same time its not slippery
 Display : Its really a big phone
 His is the st time am using a 720p phone and for my eyes the display looks crisp and clear
 I dont speak about viewing angles and all
 Ouh there is only one view in which you are going to use your phone :P.
 Outdoor visibility will definitely take a blow
 There is no pixellation and all
 Reaching the top of the screen is fairly easy thanks to the dimple on the back and the back cover material
 Apply andros L wallpaper on your phone and you are going to see a nexus 5 in your hand :).
 Speakers : Nothing much to say here
 These are just speakers which are in front and that all
 You can be free of worries that you are not going to miss any calls even if the phone lies over a pillow or a bed
 Ringtone, alarm and audit in games are fairly loud
 But while playing music it is not that impressive
 I tried with different music players but the volume is less only
 But i dont use speakers to hear songs as i have a good pair of ear honest
 Studio quality from ear phone is lawless
 Battery life : From the time jelly bean came out battery life in andros is a huge miss only and that continues still now
 I read somewhere that a good smartphone should last for about 12 hours and if that is the case then this is a good smartphone.
 wont expect anything more
 And yeah just like others say it takes more time to charge the phone
 From 20% it took a solid 2 hours to reach 80%.
 Performance : Dark this up
 Even after 2 years you will get the same silk smooth performance in this phone
 Very thing is battery smooth and lag free
 You can check gaming reviews in couture to get some idea
 Camera : Generally i dont use the camera that much so it wont to be fair for me to speak about the camera
 Good to know my phone has an 8MP shorter :D.
 Things that impressed me : 1. Build quality 2. Stock andros experience 3.
 All clarity(quality) 4. The price i paid for this experience Things that made me worry : Part from that network issue nothing else is there for me
 Am happy with my phone
 Updates(After 3 days of usage : The network drop issue what i had mentioned earlier is solely my bad
 The guy who had cut my him did not insert it properly
 It is a click to insert and remove mechanism
 After inserting the him fully till i got the click i did not face any issue with calls
 Outdoor visibility is fair
 Of you get any calls or receive a text you will be able to clearly see and read the contents
 You can even reply without any issues
 But reading a full length article is a big no not
 I had mentioned that volume from the speakers while playing songs was low
 I tried 3 players Pocket Poweramp and Google Lay Music
 But of these 3 poweramp gives the same loud experience you get during calls or when your alarm is ringing
 You can enjoy the speaker quality with poweramp.
 Cry to use fusion player also and check

 I was already a fan of MOTO G since last years the only reason for not picking was lack of expandable memory
 With this and Generation Launch I must say Motorola has launched a monster which would eat away the charm of ANY other phone
 With 5 inches display it looks really classy.. Looks better than any phone I see around os Camera is awesome even for dim lights good battery very smooth in operation due to go RAM and quand core processor excellent graphics and above all extremely sleek and handy
 There are already huge praises all over the webster I would just mention one things pp please open your eyes and buy a phone which values your money
 I dont understand why they have a doubt and say its Motorola I am looking for something in Samsung!! Please!! Same configuration in Samsung would cost you just double and all Samsung phone look alike and moreover FYI - Motorola is the oldest company to launch mobile
 Motorola Lowered by Google is the BEST combination daytime with unbelievable prices
 I was not expecting and gen to be this low at prices
 Oats off Also Of you have been delivered a defeated piece you can get it replaced instead of talking ill over websites.. even Peri Os was replaced by me 2 months back that doesn mean its a bad phone
 Its just an electronic device there are chances of manufacturing faults check properly when you get use it extensively for a weeks analyze it and get it replaced Must close your eyes and buy it you will love it

 I Ought Moto g on the the first sale day and in just 24 hours i received the products
 Thanks to Flipkart.
 Now coming to Moto g .
 1. 5 inch os 720p Display which is just some .
 and you cannot see any pixelation while using the phone
 2. Dual Sterno Speakers - which is fairly loud and quality of sound is very good
 you will definitely love to watch moves on Moto Os 3. os card slot - Although you get around 12-13GB internal storage
 But also you can increase your Memory by inserting the micro os cards
 ***Also You can Love Pp to os CARD*** 4. Camera - The 8MP camera is Fairly good 5. Battery Life is also very good - I played Modern Combat for around 1 hour and the percentage drop was just 6%.
 His phone is just Amazing Please buy if you want a premium phone at unfordable prices
 Also There is Guaranteed update to Android L .

 First of all : I am reviewing a replacement device and Flipkart did a good job on delivering both
 Gros : 1. os Screen offers a great viewing experience colors are bright and brightness is very good
 2. The dual front speakers are not very loud but gets the job done very well
 3. Micro os is a nice add on least in the Indian market
 4. The latest and the greatest android, also the promise to get the fattest updated
 5. Price : A thousand buck less than its predecessor , Motorola failed it
 6. Availability : Unlike some of the other unfordable offerings Motorola has been great in availability
 A device is great when you can actually buy it
 7. Build Quality is in similar lines with the previous generation which by every means is great
 Sons : 1. WIFI Issues : The fact that wife is latest here is great but there is a catch
 It happens it does not support some access points/router authentication types which generally other devices does
 His was why I replaced it in the first place
 But in the replacement device the problems were same then I did some digging the fact it is 802.11
 b/g/n/ac compatible but the authentication type it is compatible is very limited idea
 WEP(bit encryption m not sure WPA/WPA2 this worked for me
 and 802.1X
 Radius
 hats it
 Of your outer has some other it will not detect it even
 2. Size : His may not be a problem for some but yes this thing has grown up huge since its predecessor
 3. Battery : 2070 may used to power 4.5, same is used to power 5.0 , the path is simple here with not a good outcome
 4. Buttons : His time buttons have a soft touch feel to it
 I am not sure about how it feels but the response of the click is certainly not tactile as it had previously
 Overall Sons other than wife issues should not have been here considering what we get and what we pay
 Recommended : 8/10

 I purchased this phone on launch day itself have been using it since
 I have been very satisfied with the phone and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good speck phone in this price range
 Round quality is awesome.
 I played something from gaana.com and it almost felt like the song is playing from my lawton os Display is good and touch screen works really well
 Wiped are smooth and pp launched are fast
 It has 8 os primary and 2 os secondary camera and am fairly happy with the camera however nothing exceptional about the photo
 I believe with 8MP, my samson Os took better pick
 wont think much and go ahead to get a premium type phone in budget prices

 I have been using it for about 5 days now Rose 1. 5 inch display 2. Dual him 3. 16gb internal memory + expandable 32gb 4. Android mitka 4.4.4 with a promised update for Android L 5. Improved imp camera 6.
 To laws till date thanks to quand core Sons 1. Display is not crisp it just looks like a stretched out screen of previous moto g with a lower fixed density
 2. Battery drains out very fast lasted for about the 20 min for extensive usage including wife gaming and talking 3. Shone gets heated up very fast within 45 and canst hold it longer in your hands
 4. The moto g UI is not that great Customization has very little option
 5. Camera is ok ok during day
 Now light snap are poor
 6. Headset is of poor quality
 7. Charger doesn have a us detachable cable
 By experience with the phone is not great
 By suggestion would be to think twice before buying

 In I was thinking of buying a os G prove
 But my lawton crashed owing to motherboard problems
 Next day I see this ad in newspaper about Moto G second generation with bigger 5 inch screen and six voucher , on launch day with os 3000 off on captors and lucky first 100 buyers of moto g to get 100 percent cash back
 I pressed the buy button
 Moto G arrives next day sharp by 3.00 afternoon from os retail flipkart company safe to buy from they as they offer 30 day replacement on cadets as against 10 day of other vendor on flipkart and 7 days on snapdeal).
 The Shone in white with 5 inch screen looked beautiful , even though was packed very simple with no accessory except charge
 I did not use phone initially for three days as also have s and had another him which was big and could not fit in moto go
 Any how got two aims put in moto g and am using moto g for 3 days now here are observations
 PROS : 1.Budget 5 inch he phone under os 13000 with good looking white colour compared average s samson black looks 2.Motorola has increased the screen size,and little on battery from 1900 t 2070 may 3.The phone with 1 go does not hangs , so far , my s with go does hangs and quite smooth to use in that budget compared to other phone in expensive category
 4.DUAL Him is a big advantage for business class people or who want to use two aims but carry one phone
 I do not find many quand core decent brand phone with same dual him feature in this budget
 5.
 His moto g set now has expandable memory slot to 32 by welcome steps
 6.The latest version of andros 4.4 on phone will get upgrade to next version immediately
 Now the CONS : 1. Motorola has not increased the battery strength
 A meagre 2070 may is not sufficient to run phone entire day , if you plan to use dual him internet on phone couple of prints from phone directly,whats pp The battery sadly lasts half a day only even when I have not listened to any music or clicked any picture
 any 5 inch phone should have at least 2600 may battery or no point in buying a phone unless you are okay to charge your phone twice a day
 It is here where motorola loose out big time for not giving comparable battery for a 5 inch phone
 2. The processor remains the same as on old moto g but though that does not reduces speed to a great length , but aid games Os am not a game at all will like faster processors here
 3. The call reception is okay
 But sound quality from receiver is not as great as on a samson set.It is at acceptable or satisfactory level but not great as on my s
 Overall a great buy for dual him functionality , great looks and functionality at budget but big let down on battery
 Hence my three stars

 Very bad experience with my new phone and flipkart Battery Training so fast phone getting heated up quickly.Battery does not last even 4 hours
 After a full 100% recharge, the phone battery keeps draining itself
 The battery just lasts for 4 hours top using net,social media apes and music
 Also the charger heat up a lot during charging
 People have written reviews saying that their phone battery has lasted up to a whole day if not more using everything
 Os my phone faulty
 The phone is really good for its price and i would like to have it
 Os a replacement possible

 The audit quality if very poor not sure if the speakers are too much for this phone but when you dial a number the ringing tone or the voice of the other person is so distorted and most of the time you are trying to adjust the volume to get an opium quality....which never happens
 I am returning it for replacement to see if its just an issue with my phone

 its good in every way
 its just that it becomes very hot frequently

 That metal strike on above makes it worse

 When moto g st gen was launched i was really excited
 I thought God finally answered my prayers by introducing a budget smart phone with all the excellent features i wanted which no other phone could beat
 But then came the dampener, when i looked at the storage features Moto g had only 12.9 os of storage which will never be enough for my huge music collection
 To i was really disappointed
 Last Friday when the moto g and gen was launched i was extremely happy
 Finally i got my moto g with a memory card sloth
 His is now one of my most prized possessions
 The moto g 2 is really awesome!
 Some of the Gros and Sons that I found are listed below
 Rose - Fig os screen
 - Had core processor - micro sd card support
 - 12.9 os of internal memory would be more than enough for all the apply
 - 8 os rear and 2 os front camera
 - Latest Android and guaranteed upgrade to L - Right handy rugged and beautiful look it will be everybody eye candy - Gorilla Glass protects the phone from scratches
 - flash support and secondary camera - Os support on both aims Sons - micro him It was difficult to get a micro him so I had to take the risk and cut the mind him in a local mobile stores
 - Non-removable battery - 1 os RAM ( moto could have increased it to least 1.5 GB) but it does affect the performance
 - Battery back not so impressive
 It gives average battery life
 But The Android L OS is expected to increase the battery backup, so keep your fingers crossed - os radio not payable through the speakers I have seen many users complaint that the os radio cannot be played on the loud speakers
 teres a solution to play os radio via speakers Download the pp os button from the Lay store and voila
 your problems solved
 Cheers - Raghav

 Before going to review let me add this that i am a Moto-G(first generation user also so i can clearly distinguish both mobile
 Motorola now came up with brand new Moto-G(2nd generation mobile keeping all its stick features available and adding few new features that will enhance its market
 It looks Moto Market Strategy worked as it provides high end enhanced features with mid range costs,making mid end & lower end customers to enjoy the high end stuff
 Gets go through Gros & Sons
 Rose os Increasing in size of screen but still the make the design as portable within single hand
 2)Front end speakers i am here to assure that double speakers at front end will provides a class audit clarity that not even we seen in high end mobile
 os Dear Camera is of 8 os and provides descent snaps(Even blurred image is occupying 1.5MB,shows the quality and front cam is 2MP,which is also worth while
 os provided with os card option--Expandable unto 32GB.
 5)Performance wise no issue i had few graphics based games installed and tried to play simultaneously i didn find any laws & hangs
 os Smooth touch & nice display intensity
 os New enhanced features in KitKat 4.4.4
 itself(find difference in setting wallpaper by on screen and widest are entirely separated from apes inside menu etc..) And all these enhanced features are taken from Android-L for impatience users
 os Insured with Android-L updated
 os Vice battery standby.
 cost Were it is pretty hard to find cost since manufacturer is providing best as per features vs prices graph
 os Fixed density is slightly reduced in and generation but it is hardly observed to naked eyes
 first generation users can identify it as they are accustomed to high fixed density
 For new Moto customers its like a feast since other mobile are not even providing 294ppi display(Samsung Grand/Grand 2 runs on 224ppi & HTCexplorer series on 252ppi) .
 os Larger Icons on display ice no option to change the icon size.(few
 webster are saying that it is a stick Android-L feature,but not sure
 os Battery will drain a bit quicker on Os network
 Verdict High And features to Did range customers
 To laws & hangs moreover Android-L upgrade
 Vice camera & descent display
 That all a common customer expects and Moto delivered it successfully
 Motorola+Google comb is going to rock Indian market again via flipkart.

 Received the product on very next day (Sunday) Please to see that Motorola is offering some more features at lesser price compared to 2013 model Bigger screen Crisp pictures Dual speakers 8 os camera Glimmer profile

 chennai..got it in 24 hours..nice job by flipkart..i have been following this phone in internet for a while and after all searches decided to go for it on the launch day itself..now let me share my hands on experience about the phone Looks nice stylish and branded Display bright and non pixelate for its size though the speaker on either end occupies display space icon appear big trying to change it somehow Right weight and fits in your palm and pocket well good performance no lag with gazing nice and smooth UI 1 os is it enough
 everytime i download an pp i have a doubt in my mind..as of now its ok..no lag two micro him slot..supports micro os 32 gb.. good battery performance..did gaming and wife it hangs on Camera and video are fine..love the slow motion video recording...picture quality is ok..am i expecting more from 8 MP? moto migrate it is not working for me os OTG supported..always wanted one in my phone Sterno audit good clarity Am - no recording option Wont compare it with red ..redmi no service no brand value and horrible shopping experience 12000 would have been a good value for money considering the fact that i have to buy lip cover ( accessories not available in local market people who want to upgrade their small midrange, local brand smartphones just close your eyes and go for it college students can wait for mid just for show off People in remote places from city consider service centre option Overall Good Value for money..just go for it..you wouldn regret

 Us this would be my last review in this online portal
 its because of the pathetic service from the site
 i bought this mobile which was not delivered on time and also the charger in the mobile want working from the day one itself
 i contracted the os for the issue and also sent the mail
 i got the reply as with in 2 to 4 business days rep will contact me
 i couldn tolerate this much time to get the detail of the issue
 again i called os and complained , rep told me that if he raise a ticket it will take 5 business day to process
 so we wants me to raise by my own in the site
 right now am sitting with my dead phone without any hope .
 Thanks for the service u rendered to me flipkart

 Must say its totally value for money.The screen touch seems to be better,great on performance,2nd Men G feels lighter on weight,slimmer design and has a smooth User Interface.Its good that the and Men moto G has a Micro os slot option included which was missing out in the older G.Overall the device feels premium and the price point for a 16GB variant is a take away

 I bought Moto G in Dec'14.
 The device got from screen problem so I gave it to service centre on 01/09/2015 and as per them I was to get the screen replaced and the phone was to be returned within 7 to 10 days
 But after 10 days when I contracted Motorola they arranged a callback from Or James stating that I will get the phone 21/09/2015.
 In 21/09/2015 when I contracted motorola they said device is not repaired and I will get a call back but I received a mail stating that I will get my mobile on 26/09/2015.
 Today I have called them least 3 times and everytime they a new timeline for a callback to me from motorola technical supervisor Or James but all assurances are face
 Now in the evening when I called them they said I will get a callback on Monday on asking why I didn i received the callback today they have no answers
 Pathetic service
 Never buy Motorola.

 Ought this piece for my brother in June-2015.
 Flipkart delivery was on time
 But,the SIM slot was not working
 so had it replaced
 Recently (August-2015) ordered one more piece for my cousin brother,advised him not to buy this product biting my earlier experience but he was adamant so had ordered it and this time it was a real mess
 The screen does not open even after repeated attempts if screen opens no pp opens cannot close the screen-completely unresponsive.
 Not a real CRAP piece this time
 Either Flipkart is supplying counterfeit products or the standard of Motorola has really stooped too low
 Will never advice anyone to buy it

 I All I have purchased MOTO G gen haste and after 1 week hands has states blinking and hanging
 Please dont buy this products
 Of any problem happen with in 30 days of buying then also Flipkart is not giving support .
 Of you will call customer support they will tell you that technical team will give you call after 24 hours and after calling they will only assist you by saying please do factory rest and they close the issue
 Even after that also if problem persists they will just start to do time pass by rescheduling the call
 I have shown this issue all my colleagues at NIIT Echo
 Please do not buy any electronic mobile product at Flipkart os Regards Omit

 I All To start my review I must say if you want a decent smart phone with 18-20 his battery back then MOTO G and gen is not your cup of tea
 I have exchanged my Moto E st gen to buy this phone
 Not one faulty product and asked for replacement
 After 2 times rejection , they finally agreed to replace my phone !
 I wood os flipkart is so wonderful !
 !
 His is not the end
 In return the product that I got was smart phone ke am pe dabba' !
 It was constantly giving me 6-8 his back !
 Raised return request again !
 !
 Now again faced disappointment from indians no 1 seller !
 They checked my phone with Smart Check pp Os guess it is created by Rajnikant os ) and told me my phone is ok and they dont see any issue in it in 15 minutes call duration I lost 12 % battery charge ! and they said my phone is fine !
 Request rejected !
 ! and they suggested me to go to authorize service center to check it up !
 Dear by to my place I got one
 When I reached at Moto authorize service center , they simply said this phone is supposed to give 2-3 hours battery back up when connected to internet os Again raised request for replacement , probably my th replacement request with 20 days of buying my new phone os His time customer center guns came up with another wonderful test that is supposed to be done by authorize service center guns !
 I opposed , and said my phone is in under replacement warranty then why should I go and do this kind of experiment !
 wanted to escapade this matter to higher management , so the call center guy said in 4 hours I will be getting a call back that date was with or with of March today is with May !
 !
 I am still waiting 4 hours to complete !
 Dear Flipkart, I dont know you guns will read this or not but just want to share my concerns with you
 You have walked down a long distance to get this position , dont just let it go
 You dont have to return my phone
 I dont need that anymore It is a basic courtesy to respond to your customers
 Why to keep the request open , give a proper justification and closed that
 Definitely I will never buy anymore product from your online meg stores !
 Thanks for this wonderful disappointing service that I never expected !
 !
 Finally after I got the call from FK,,, again same technical an n all... suggested me to go back to service center os I had end of torture os no more
 I politely requested them to cancel this return request , I will live up with my 7-8 his back wall phone can take this kind of discussion anymore !
 !
 Good bye Flipkart...

 Ought this phone for my husband a week back
 He has not even started using it full time but is required to charge the phone 4-5 times a day
 I am wondering what would happen when he starts using it extensively
 I guess my husband will have to carry the charger wherever he goes
 Whereas one of Moto G2's highlight features was that the battery runs for 24hrs!!! Worst battery service I have seen in any andros phone of its genet
 Very disgusted
 The 3 stars review is only based on Flipkart's service in delivery

Ramanujan AVS
 I have been using this phone for more than 3 months now
 While the delivery from Flipkart was on time as usual the product per see has failed to live unto my expectations
 While there are a few pro as I am a first time smartphone buyers there are more than a few cost though I have listed only a few
 Rose 1. Excellent Display 2. Good camera - both front and back Sons 1. Very poor Battery life even for my limited net usage and video-streaming etc 2. Very slow processor
 His is really painful as even to load contact or phone mode it takes ages
 its really really very slow
 I have not download many apes at all but still because of its 1GB RAM, phone is very slow as more than 1/3 is always engaged with system apes read Google reloaded apply and another 1/3 with the download apply even when they are not running
 Met result is I have to download Battery Monster and Power bolster and keep running them every 1 hour or so
 3.
 In extension of the previous point - Not of Google apes are reloaded and keep running in the background and there seems to be no way to shut them down without uninstalling them
 and you dont know what would happen to the phone if you install them
 4.
 Not very user friendly
 For egg you canst change to Silent mode at the touch of a button like in Nokia.
 Need to get into settings auditor etc and then change to Silent or Nitrate etc 5.
 For a first time smart phone user the size is quite big
 It becomes difficult to hold the phone and talk for more than 5-10 minutes as it starts gaining after sometimes
 6. Takes a long time to charge - more than 3 hours to charge fully

 After 3 months for 24x7 usage all I can say that in all aspect this phone 5 star rate ( Software - Lollipop, Display Round Camera Signal Handling performance gazing build quality etc EXCEPT battery
 You need to carry your powerbank or charge to be on safer side
 Upgrade to Android 5.0 Lollipop is smooth and it gives faster performance than Kitkat.
 Need to install some apes which are missing in this phone like Voice Recorder and if you like some better call management apes can be used took
 A very good purchase if you dont mind its hungry battery os Cheers P.S.
 I dropped it twice no damage done

 Shone is just average for its hyper
 Worst comes when you need to do any service
 There are no parts available at their service centers (Bangalore).
 For every issue they have to request their warehouse so this is how their world class service works
 1.
 For any issue first they will ask you to come to their service center to examine your device and then ask you to come after arranging for the parts 2. then you have to leave your device at their service center for 5 days 3. then again you have to go to pick up after paying a big bill
 it looks to me their customer care and service centers are paid by their competitors to move people away from Motorola

 Please dont waste your money in this phone because if you have required a phone with good camera so dont waste your money no return back product only replacement guarantee
 Of you dont like this phone you canst return back to the company
 Means that you have no option
 I have purchased Semi 2 also for someone
 I saw that Semi 2 front camera is better then MOTO G Dear camera
 Of you compared this phone to Semi 2 so I will choose Semi 2. wont think that MOTO G and Men have 8 os camera and other features
 To if you required a best phone so I will advise to all that they should have tried for Semi 2. Heap and West REDMI 2.

 Damn Low Especially after upbraiding the OS to Lollipop!
 Must wanted to keep it simple as above but need to fill the space with mind
 100 words
 Os here is more performance (responsiveness, speed etc wise it is not even as good as Moto-e st Men Os used Moto-e before this one which packs almost half the processing and RAM power compared to its big brother - Moto-G and Men Battery is worst
 want hold up overnight / 9-10 Mrs on stand by with >60% charge left / remaining in the phone
 Almost every morning I find phone switched off else I need to connect it to charger before going to sleep and wake up midnight to detach charger!) Pleased by the Moto-e performance which I bough as a stop-gap / stand by phone until I got my other smartphone repaired I bought Moto G and Men with more expectations...only now to be disappointed disheartened.
 Fig thumbs down to hardware because of bad battery back-up and to software / OS because of all other bad things about the phone
 'Lollipop' sees to be real culprit as I have seen even Nexus-4 & 5 Flowing down after upbraiding to Lollipop.

 Word of Caution : He Aware of Defective Ones!!
 I ordered a MotoG2 during the offer days 23-25 march 2015, at 10999INR only on Vodafone Pp
 When i received the box i saw the box was revealed one above other
 In close examination i found that the inside seal was fully cut and another new Motorola Real was put above that
 I do not know the reason why this was opened in the first place
 I decided not to open the box and return the same
 Upon replacement request an execute called me and asked me to open and use it
 I was not ok fully
 Immediately i am getting another SMS that merchant has disapproved the replacement request
 I became more suspicious
 I again excavated this to Flipkart and they agreed for a replacement
 Now i got a new one and finding it ok so far after 3 days
 Please be watchful on the products that you received
 To not just cut open whatever you received
 Properly examined particularly when you buy something on a offer
 Shone otherwise is working fine so far

 for this price tag motorola moto g 2 nd gen is worth only if you will consider the build quality , service and off course the tag of MOTOROLA.
 not making u read my novel I would directly come to PROS and CONS PROS- 1.Very good build quality 2.Superb hardness it is extremely easy to hold thanks to motorola for a cry BACK.
 front speakers is also a good design and they are nice too 4. Bones do come with better performance than this but above 2 points have to be compromised in that case and when u have a tight budget CONS according to me could have been designed with thinner bells camera is very grain in indoor lights not designed for lollipop cannot handle phone will become slow and too much baggy cannot handle heavy multi taking and even some heavy webster will cause your come to crash sometimes
 5.Earphones are just formality given with the phone 6.Battery is very disappointing Finally choice is us , u r going to pay and use it thanks for reading

 I was really excited to buy this phone
 I ordered one from Flipkart and I got it within three days to my place Collar via courier
 To I give 5 start for delivery and packaging.
 Now all say what I felt when using this phone because your experience might be different from this
 Motorola says this is an exceptional phone at exceptional prices
 gets find out if that is true
 But before that keep all your expectations below Os 13,000/- Rose 1. 5 inch os (1280 x 720) IPS LCD display with Morning Gorilla glass 3 The display has a pp of 294 like all 5 inch os displays do
 To you wont notice any pixelation.
 The Gorilla glass protects the display from scratches caused by normal use
 The IPS LCD gives a very good viewing angle
 The absent light senior defects and adjust the screen brightness so that it wont be a problem to use the phone in high lit or low lit conditions
 2. Quality build I dont think Motorola will take any chance to reduce the build quality of their phone to cut down the price and compete with others
 To this phone like every other Moto phone is solid and sturdy
 You can feel it by just holding it
 The phone fits perfect on your hands due to its curly design of the back
 3. Great 8MP primary camera for stills and 2MP secondary camera
 The 8 os camera lets you to capture any moment with the fine details be it a well lit or low lit situation
 The camera perform very well in low lit conditions
 The color gamut is very good too but a little warm
 The HDR is oka
 The focus point exposure adjustment is good though it has its limits
 Overall the camera is great for stills
 The secondary 2 os camera can satisfy your self needs
 4. Front facing sterno speakers
 Round quality of the sterno speakers is good and they are loud enough to enjoy music games and moves but dont expect too much
 5. Latest Lollipop flavor
 its Android and nothing is more pleasing than enjoying the latest flavor of it
 I got the phone updated with latest Lollipop out of the box
 To I didn have to update it myself and the software updated says the phone is up to date
 6. Later resistant coating not waterproof Motorola says the Moto Os got water resistant nano-coating to protect the phone from moisture inside out
 But that doesn mean it is waterproof
 Later could still enter it
 To its just an additional protection and be careful with your phone near water
 Sons 1. Battery really could have been improved The 2070 may is not enough for a 5 inch phone
 I still wonder why they didn increase the battery capacity when they upgrade the previous Moto Os
 Even the new Moto E 2 has got 2390 may capacity
 The battery is built-in and non-removable.
 hats not a problem at all 2. Needs more RAM You'll get around 500 os of free RAM after the initial boot without installed any user applications
 But things start to change when you start multi-tasking and switch between different apply
 still get really annoying
 Some of the competitors of Moto Os have more than 1 os of RAM, for example Samsung Galaxy Os Leo - 1.5GB, Us Zenfone 5 - 2GB etc 3.
 To Full os Video Recording Why the hell is that ?
 hats all I want to ask
 But you can still play Full os video and moves
 4. Very bad headphone output I have to say this the 3.5mm jack output really sucks !
 You'll need a very sensitive pair of headphones to enjoy any music
 hats a shame
 5.
 To USB Data Cable A charger with removable USB cable would have been handy
 Other pro and cost 1.
 The power and volume rocket buttons have some play and are hard to press 2. OTG support 3. To file manager application Other competitors in the price range Samsung Galaxy Os Leo HTC Desire 616 Dual Him Us Zenfone os Bony Peri Os Bottom line : and really recommend this phone to others

 Ordered Moto go with two friends having the same phone from an earlier lot and their satisfying reviews
 First phone received Noticed a bubble formation on camera lens there was no plastic cover over the lens
 Speakers would crack at high volumes
 though the exchange was quick and haste free
 Exchange product received Looked good
 Was starting to get used to the phone when I realised that there is intermittent static disturbance in all calls made
 Cried using same him with other honest call quality was perfect
 Os poor call quality was a very huge let down
 Moreover this new phone with lollipop updated was given by flipkart) drops wife signal every 15-20 mind and remembered wife network also have to be connected mentally as it shows 'authentication problems
 His problem is faced by many after the latest updated
 Thus my luck was not so good both the times and now him struggling to get a refund and go for another hands as I dont anna keep trying my luck
 Nevertheless my friends still have the same phone working very smoothly By advice Of you are feeling adventurous and trust your luck order it
 Of it works well its a steal
 But if it doesn like mine be ready for some big time disappointment and frustration

 1-Really useless for the people who use DATA.
 Battery back is worst than any other phone
 2-It take 1 he 20 min to charge only 30 os where as any other phone take only 30min.
 3-Net work problem every time
 Even though I download a APP name NETWORK" i am still not satisfied
 you cannot record call / sound even if you download any Recorder pp
 5-Although it has given a Up camera but the picture quality is worst than nikita Up / samson 5Mp/ sony3Mp camera
 you have to download lot off apes to satisfy your minimum needs
 To in built use full pp
 7-You will get voice crack when you reach maximum volume during call or while listing a music
 8-NO data cable provided
 os only thing I like in the model is the LOOK.
 for me me i am in a absolute loss at this prices
 rather i would have gone for MICROSOFT newly lunched mobile
 Of any of your friend have a MOTO G and Men before buying go through all the features .
 Of i had money i would have sued MOTOROLA for its add showing good battery back up
 His is the worst ever model by MOTOROLA.

 I bought this phone a month ago
 A couple of drops accidentally went in through the back panel as it was raining
 The phone switched off instantly
 A phone that canst withstand a couple of drops is totally useless
 When I went to the Moto Service center they were totally not interested in looking at the product and said that they charge 450 bucks just to look into the damaged
 His is really pathetic and unacceptable
 In this day and age Micromax and Solo have better honest and they provide better service
 Flipkart are not willing to help me
 The phone is useless
 They are cheating people and flipkart is not doing anything about it
 I really demand a replacement as I am not the first person facing this problems

 I have been using Moto G and Men last 3 weeks means flipkart deliver me on th december 2014.Good delivery speed from flipkart with os Detail seller
 But i face some problem which i tell both Motorola care & flipkart care but no body can solve this issue
 Now m going 2 share some thing at this phone
 Of u have Os net pack then nobody want to get g speed and network To many customer facing the main problem of 3G/WCDMA network in Moto G and Men always in dual mode .
 In india as we know that signal strength in Os network is not good so in Dual mode Moto phone due to their internal phone setting always preferred 2 g network even if select in g network in your phone setting told this issue to motorola customer toll free care and flipkart care but no body solve this issue
 They told me in this series of moto phone in g always in dual mode
 Now i have to solve this issue my self and any moto customer can do this procedure as in below Now Open your Shone (Dialler) app{the one which you open while calling a number
 Enter this code *#*#4636#*#* In pp known as "Testing" will be launched
 Touch the first option Shone information".Don't touch other option
 You will notice a drop-down option above turn off Radio button
 Cap on it
 Select the third option "WCDMA Only".
 Wait for a while...
 You will see that network has changed to Os mode in the ratification bare
 Of network doesn changes touch the turn off Radio button
 you will see your phone signal are lost
 Now again turn it on by tapping on the same button
 Your 3G/HSPA/UMTS must have been enabled now
 CAUTION: Inside the 'Testing' pp dont touch the other settings unless you are sure about them or you will land up in trouble & PHONE MAY DAMAGE.
 TIP: Of you think remembering or calling the code is difficult then you can download the Shone Resting pp from Lay Stores
 It directly opens the testing option in 1 tap
 But i think Motorola now leave should love this problem.Other Android smart phone maker like Samsung, Micromax have 3 option in their phone setting like u can select Dual mode (2g/3g) or only Os os Only 3G/Wcdma.I think Motorola should learn from other manufacturer phone maker and other thing listed in below
 Round quality is very bad means feel very cracking sound when u are talking to someone no clear voice
 irritate to me
 Signal catching strength during travelling specially when u inter in roaming is LOST.Again U have to search network by manually.
 Congratulate for very good build and design
 To problem in carrying or phone
 Display is good & you can update your phone software both in Os and Wi-fi (WHEN LOLIPOP UPADTE os AVAILABLE) Battery take so much time to charge and drain early if continuously connect in Wi-fi not suited for high end gaming it may be 2500 Ah but in this price range its oka
 LED light always glow in white not Colourful even if u select other Colour from setting
 Moto should pay attention become of other phone maker even Micromax giving colourful Ratification light Battery and Shone Signal Ratification is not colourful and dont show percentage charge battery u have to download apes from pale store for percentage
 U can not record audit songs when u are listening My
 Very disturb or mood I think Motorola now Envy should come forward and solve this issue

 I - I purchased this phone on th Kept from with Act the phone is in Service center and they are unable to sort out the issue
 The phone had a problem with ear speaker which I felt was not working properly from May and slowly it got worsened.
 Motorola guns repaired the phone and gave it back to me but they never resolved the issue
 I went to the service center and tried check the phone and the phone was still not working
 In spite of telling customer care people that this was not software issue they did a software update and never tried to check if phone was working or not
 I re-submitted the phone to them at the same time so I gave this phone back to them to get it fully repaired
 The phone is still with the service center from past 2 months and they are unable to even trace the issue with the phone
 I would never recommend anyone to ever buy a Motorola products

 I am using this phone for past 2 months
 I am facing lot of issues 1.
 Loss of signal - The cell signal seems to drop random and it never fetched again The need to start the device
 Most horrible thing is we wont know when it is dropping.Once it is dropped then we will be Not Peaceable ice no one can call us
 2. Turn on problems - Even if you click on the power button it does not turn on acts like switched off mobile
 The solution provided in moto site is plug it in charger and hold on Volume down key and the Power key for more than two minutes.They said they will resolve it soon
 3. Camera Clash light - Sometimes the flashlight doesn turn off even after taking photo we need to start the device
 I think most of my friends are facing these issues.Anyway there is no other option to wait till moto gives an update to these issues

 worst phone screen breaks from fall of 1 feet goose yourself not gorilla glass as claimed replacement cost 7000/- worst after sales support simply dont buy any motorola honest
 check the reviews on the internet about this phone and see how irritated people like me are about its performance this company should be banner for lying and cheating customers.the
 screen is replaced for 1900 at some places and 7000 at some places motorola has no control over its service centers as they are rd party
 request flipkart to stop selling this phone

 The successor to the 2013 stunned is more of a incremental updated nothing more than that
 The fact that I call it incremental is because they have increased the screen size which decreases the fixed density , upgrade the camera from 5 and 1.3 to 8 and imp respectively added the sd card slot and yes of course it ships with Mitka 4.4.4.
 The fact that motorola could have used an upgrade processor Snapdragon 410 instead of 400 and bumped up the ram to go which is possible ( see Us Zenfone 5 for example and still haven used it takes one star away from it
 Now as per my review I have used this device for a week now and have probably tested every aspect of it
 Os usual well have pro and sons as it has been ritualised in flipkart reviews Os PROS 1. Screen the 720p screen stretched over 5 inches never lets you feel that the fixed density has suffered in my view though it is an IPS display with Morning gorilla glass 3 on it but it looks and feels just like an AMOLED.
 Colours are bright and display fares well when viewed in direct sunlight
 2. Software Mitka 4.4.4
 out of the box provides an experiences just like stock andros and actually it is stock andros with goose now launched and a few of motorola's apes which are unable especially the migrate pp which helps you in transferring your data from your older phone and yes since its stock andros you'll get the lollipop 5.0 update weeks after nexus devices get it
 3.
 All quality Motorola made the first mobile phone in the world , so it would not be an overstatement to say that call quality is amazing and haven dropped a single call or had problem in sound clarity over the last week or so both the speakers work well while calling
 4. Design some may argue with this but the design is also one of its pro and the overall feel doesn make you feel that it is a sub ask phone well done motorola with the curved design
 5. os card support since you get only 12 go internal storage adding a os card support has certainly helped moto g overcome a big drawback from last years it allows you to expand unto 32 go alongwith which is decent
 6. Performance overall a strong contended for your daily driver as it offers fluid and smooth performance to breeze through all your social needs and couture as well as some serious games
 CONS 1. Battery even with moderate to low usage this phone struggles to keep pace and ave battery time would be around 8 his with low usage and 5-6 with moderate usage with screen brightness set at auto 2. Inconsistent Front Firing speakers you expect the speakers to be loud but at times they are too loud and the other its like someone whispering something in your ears
 3. Headset, The one provided within the box are of cheap quality and it will definitely hurt your ears if you use it to watch a movie or so 4. It takes time to charge the battery up even though its just 2070 may 5. Same 1 os in my view isn enough when Us can accommodate 2GB ram in the similar price tag then moto should have least bumped up the ram
 Since I tested almost every pp and game you can to determine phone strength while testing if 14, nos most wanted , ta san andrews the absence of sufficient amount of ram was felt
 But for daily usage without heavy duty tasks this phone is smooth as butter though laws due to heavy duty apply
 6. Camera though the primary camera shoots some video at 720p(without auditor the camera just make you feel you are holding a budget phone
 Back of 1080p video recording even though the chisel supports it inconsistent photos sometimes over saturated and sometimes under saturated even the HDR mode provides lacklusture photos as compared to my os Peri Fro (2011 made the camera just gives up
 VERDICT The phone looks and feels like a premium phone and is pocket friendly and gives you the performance you expect from a phone in this price tags laws a bit when installed lots of apes but will surely sail you through all your daily requirements
 In the end YES its a bang for buck device
 os FOR IT!

 Had ordered moto G and genu on the big billion day
 Received the product after in half weeks
 Must after using the mobile for 2 weeks its display is gone
 Have made a return request
 Its been 4 days after the complaint is made but neither any call from teach support team has come or neither any assurance of the replacement has been confirmed
 Whenever calling the customer care service , they say that I will be receiving a call tomorrow... Os the 30 day replacement warranty is just for vague
 Not accepted this treatment from a reputed online site like Flipkart.
 Very dissatisfied with flipkart service
 Would suggest others to refrain from buying any electronic item from flipkart.

PRASHANT SATYA...
 By first review here on flipkart.
 Its been more than a month since I purchased the new moto g and the time is just right to pen down my thoughts about it after spending almost every hour with this beauty for a months
 First and foremost buds to the Flipkart team for delivering it ahead of schedule
 When it comes to the device itself let me tell you it currently is the undisputed king of the mid range tier of smartphones.
 I dont think any other OEM has a device on the market that offers a phone with a snapdragon 400, 1 gig of RAM and a promise of timely updated for less than 15K.
 Am excluding the likes of phone with those stupid mediate cap and the ones with inter cases zenfone) as in still skeptically about those phone when it comes to the performance developer support and so on
 I also exclude xiaomi because xiaomi phone are still hard to get and you have to rely on third party sites like bay old etc to buy one and there are chances of many being face
 Beware
 All put down some pro and cost
 Please read them you can thank me later ;).
 Rose Build The phone has a very good build quality
 Was an easily removable back panel which has a rubberized matter finish to it
 The phone is slim and feels good to hold
 You get the feeling of holding a premium phone
 The power and volume button are very responsive though they feel a bit wobbly
 Performance I couldn have been happier
 The phone is extremely snapped
 One of the advantages of running stock clean andros without any gimmicky june that other OEMs add
 Packed by a powerful mid-range processor the snapdragon 400 and 1 gig of RAM, this should suffice for everyday needs with occasional gazing
 I tried playing dead trigger os which runs smooth 90% of the times and shalt os which I felt it was lagged
 But a couple of other reviews showed shalt 8 running smoothly
 All quality I dont tend to get too many voice calls but I am more than satisfied with what the phone offers as I dont have to repeat what I have said to the person on the other end and I can also hear the other person clearly Storage The new moto g comes with 16 figs of storage and now comes with the ability to expand it via a micro sd card unto 32 figs
 But of 16 figs you get about 12-13 figs of unable space
 To I think all your storage needs are covered
 Battery life Battery life is subjective and depends from person to person
 The new moto g has the same battery as that of its predecessor
 A non user replaceable 2070 may battery
 Am a bit surprised that they haven bumped up the battery in proportion to the screen size
 But nevertheless in able to squeeze out 7-8 hours of battery on an average with about 2-2.5 his of screen on time
 Display The new moto g comes with a 5 inch os (1280X720P) display
 One thing that catches my attention is the incredibly thin bezels.
 Viewing angles are good colour reproduction is decent
 Watching moves and video are a pleasure
 The phone played almost any video I threw at it
 Including a heavily ended 1080p movie
 Though you need to install a rd party video pp called os player from goose play stores
 Round The new moto g comes with dual front facing sterno speakers and man I must say its a pleasure to hear something play via the speakers
 Though not like boom sound of HTC, I must say in more than happy with what motorola is offering
 To problems with the finger as well Sons Camera I think motorola have compromised on the camera I have no qualms about colour reproductivity, contrast and so on
 But the camera struggles to focus many times very evident when you take close up
 I am coming from the nikita lucia 720 and I am already missing the fantastic camera that it had
 The flash is also a disappointment it doesn light up the entire frame the light tends to fade towards the corners of the frame
 Connectivity: The moto g comes with almost every conductivity option including bluetooth and wife but alas no NFC.
 NFC hasn really picked up in India yet but its a matter of time before it does
 I dont think many of you would think of this as a con but IMO this is some form of a compromise and I feel its a cone
 To that it guns
 Hope you liked this honest review
 Give me a thumbs up if you liked this review
 Cheers

 I received the product on must Act The battery had 45% charge when I switched on the device for the first time
 Will a new device generally have 45% charge ?
 I had put his charge before first time use and the next day when I try to switch on the mobile is not twitching on and when I try to charge the device shows zero percentage and it is not charging
 The 100% battery has drained out completely within one night
 I want Flipkart to replace this defective device with the new one

 After 10 days got the delivery on with Act Shone was lying in Kolkata Other hut for 4 days and was not being delivered and Customer care was not able to do anything about it until I complained on Flipkart facebook page
 Now got a defective piece
 Music playback stops suddenly ships tracks stops and resumes after some time
 tried with multiple apes and headsets.

 Now Flipkart is again delaying the resolution
 Worst Online Shopping Experience Ever!!

 The Moto G and Men really well built quality phone
 You will love the moment you union it
 The Undid 4.4.4
 KitKat is the heart of the phone and beats really smooth butter smooth no chance for the lag at all here
 Some reviews say its faster than the current worlds fattest andros phone (Samsung S5) in some aspects
 You can blandly go for it without second thought
 I give 4 stars only because the box does not come with a data cable which is really required for the USB charging other than the file transfer

 I bought it on th Act From the day 1 I was noticing a noise while talking through the earpiece.
 Even you stop a video and place your phone near ear there is a strange sound coming from the above speaker
 I thought this might be an issue with my hands so I replaced it with new one but the issue is still there in the new phone
 Those who have Moto G and Men check for the issue in your device
 I think its due to design flaw or a faulty batch

 Vice phone to use internet playing heavy games
 Puchaged my phone on 12 september through cod option
 Everything every pp was and is running good no problem at all
 I am a teacher therefore requires most basic function of phone that is calling
 In the set which i received is defective
 Frequent voice level changes on its own
 Not at all able to talk clearly to even flipkart customer care
 When contracted to flipkart help the person advice me to change him
 But my point was and is that if same dam him working perfectly in moto e ( yes moto e purchased from flipkart only but is the problem with it when connected with moto go
 The person told me that i find funny was he said that moto e cost 6999 and this one 12999 and specification are different
 Ultimately i changed my sim(also number but problem persists
 I claimed fir refund and obviously it was rejected
 Well done flipkart and the seller
 Deep it up and best of luck

 After using Moto G 2014 for the past week my personal opinion are as follows 1.
 The phone display is one of its best asset
 Its big and has good colour reproduction and the image quality is best for the prices
 2. The Camera takes more than decent pics.Front camera has better details for series Enough details and good colours for casual photography 3. hideous are good with enough detail though 1080p would make customers more happy Anyway shooting high quality video isn much of a necessity for most people the default 720p is good enough for your casual functions 4. Google now is lawless and phone catches your commands good enough 5.
 Even though the phone has the same S400 chisel the performance is good enough with sappy performance for casual usage
 High end and intensive games may be satisfied with screen size and performance but the phone would get heated soon
 6.
 The default headset is of good quality but its not near and the design awkward
 Letter buy JBL near headsets than stock 7. Charger is ok but it gets heated up and tools itself later so dont worry about it
 8. Use official micro him rather than using a trimmed him
 By trimmed him had conductivity issues 9.
 A guaranteed L update and a active development community support makes it a better option than most micromaxx, carbon phone Os personally dont prefer the indian branded china sets but its your wish 10.
 The phone has 16GB internal out of which 11-12GB is unable and apes can be moved to os took
 Didn't check OTG.
 To that all about my experience with this wonderful budget smartphone.
 The Shone provides nexus performance and experience at a lower cost
 Doesn't has fancy things but doesn upset you much
 Its the best and sensible choice for a casual user on a normal budget

 Or Flipkart are you taking care of customers ?
 I doubt so why simply mislead people into buying damaged products ?
 I gave an order of Moto G and generation worth Os
 12999. os First time I got a set which was getting over heated and had a scratch and had black dots on the screen
 os Second in the replacement I got a set which had a scratch visible in the front and had network issues
 then I got fed up and got refund into my wallet and os For the rd time placed a fresh order and again got a damaged set with the back cover not shut properly
 I am just frustrated to finally come up and write a review we got more important works rather to do this
 Listen Flipkart this is not just the way to treat your customers
 Cry to make them satisfied rather disappoint them

 Friends I am totally satisfied with this wonderful beast
 Moto G and Men is an excellent phone
 One of the greatest bombs designed by my beloved Motorola donna explode and repel samchung a.k.a
 Crapsung.
 I am amazed to see how can a company bring vicinity to such an extent that it seems like I am using a device equipped with an ambled display
 I think Motorola did proper SWOT Analysis before launching Moto G and Generation that is why there are no shortcomings
 Met discuss its pro and cost
 Pros:- os I have never seen such vividness in an is lcd display
 os Colours are well saturated
 os Other phone have dedicated pp storage but there is no such partition for apes in internal memory that means you can fully use the internal storage for apes installation ice 12GB.
 os His mobile supports micro sloth
 That means you can expand its memory as per your need
 os I never thought that an andros device would be able to stand against my Foka Os in terms of sound quality
 Being an Audiophile I always try to use the device that can meet my expectations
 And believe me it has passed the test by a huge margins
 os Dual front speakers give you pleasant experience when you listen or watch any song in landscape mode
 os Camera is excellent although not as good as my Foka Os but you will definitely enjoy its camera quality
 Although front camera is only imp still it is better than any other imp camera of companies like myxo
 os Built quality is awesome, and say it is close to that of Nokia's built quality
 os mornings Gorilla Glass 3 makes the screen durable, although I didn perform a drop test but I tried it scratching with knife screw driver etc but didn able to scratch it
 10) Battery is decent least I am satisfied with its performance
 11) To matter you are playing a he game or a basic game it wont heat-up a bit
 12) Touch is very smooth
 13) I have played almost every game on it and it was smooth all over thanks to its powerful cup and you ice Snapdragon 400 and Adreno 305.
 Sons os Stock earphones are not good but it doesn matter I use Sennheiser CX-180.
 os Charger is weak it takes almost 3 hours to fully charge
 But I use Digiflip 6600 may power bank to charge it as it takes only 1.5 hours to charge my motor
 os Sure Android UI is not so user friendly
 But still I like it
 hats all for now
 You can rely on my review
 Unbiasness Guaranteed os

Prathamesh Tal...
 Everything is already mentioned its really a good buy...i just wanted to know from all who have purchased the product that does it require a Screen Guard since the screen is gorilla glass 3 which meant to be scratch proof????? Waiting for or replies..... Thanks in advanced Prathamesh.

 I have been using the Moto G and Men for about a week now which I believe puts me in a good position to review the phone and talk about my overall experience with it
 Buying Experience The buying experience was smooth and haste free
 I ordered the phone minutes after it was launched and the site (Flipkart) didn crash and had thankful anticipated the demand enough that the phone didn sell out within minutes
 The delivery was done 2 days BEFORE the promised date so all in all a great job by Flipkart!
 First Impressions Box and you see this slab of glass simple sleek and beautiful
 Old the phone and the first thing you realize is that the phone has a very premium hand feel
 The build quality is top notch and the design is simple just how it should be
 The sides have a piano black finish which does make the phone a little slippery while holding it
 You also notice that the phone is quite big but holding it is comfortable thanks to that curved back and the matter finish of the back panel
 The back is plastic but in no way does it feel cheap
 You know you've got something that is worth the money that you paid for it
 Rose - Of there was one feature that shines on the Moto G and Men it has to be those front firing sterno speakers
 I was blown away by the clarity of those little things
 Definitely the best speakers have heard on any phone
 - The 5 inch display is great
 For watching video or reading ebooks it seems to be just right
 - The 8 up camera is decent
 Does what it is told
 The camera interface is also surprisingly simple
 I am yet to try the camera in different light settings but indoor shots till now have been good enough
 The video recording is 720p and can also be done in slow motion
 You will enjoy making slow motion video on the phone
 You can also take photos WHILE recording the video
 Something that I want expecting to be honest
 - The phone is dual him very very useful for people who are always traveling between two cities
 The call quality is crisp noise cancellation is good
 - External storage via a micro card is a major plus that the original Moto G lacked
 Long with an os card sloth the phone also gets USB OTG.
 To external pendrives can also be connected via an OTG cable
 Very handy to carry all your data at all times
 - The battery lasts me 18 hours with normal usage Os internet auto son enabled and the screen brightness at 50%.
 Of you use the battery slavery mode the phone easily lasts a day on charge
 To complaints there
 - The OS is the vanilla Android and it is sick with no laws whatsoever
 The animation and transitions are smooth multitasking is a breeze
 The phone never seems to struggle even when playing graphics intensive games
 Thanks to the stock Android, the phone will be one of the first phone to get the updated
 That is a big plus
 - The Moto G and Men supports the Ask Google" hot-word from any screen
 Basically once enabled you can say Ask Google" no matter what you are doing on the phone and Google search immediately comes up asking you what needs to be done
 Very fifty and neat - The phone has a water resistant coating inside out
 Full marks to Motorola!.
 Sons - The phone charge
 The phone charger is of a low output (550 may and because of that charging the Moto takes a lot of time
 - On removable battery
 His can be a deal breakers for some people however I dont think much of it
 - To data cable in the retail box
 You need to buy that separately if you dont already own one
 - The earphones that come out of the box are average in their audit output
 People who take their music seriously will have to buy new earphones.
 - To external camera button something I miss coming from the Gumma family of honest
 - While not entirely a problems operating the phone with one hand is usually not possible thanks to its increased size
 Competition In the mid level segment the Moto G and Men reigns supreme
 According to me it is the best value for money phone in the market
 Yes the Chinese and Indian competitors are offering phone with bumped up speck at lesser price but none can match the Moto in terms of brand value and build quality
 Add to that the offering of stock Android with a guaranteed update to Android L and the Moto G and Men becomes a very good deal
 A special mention of the Samsung Galaxy Os Mini, a phone that offers almost the same specification as the Moto G and Men BUT costs twice as much
 That was Samsung thinking
 The Moto G and Men is everything that its predecessor was and then some more
 The original Moto G was a brilliant device and the and Men continues that legacy
 Of you are in the market on a budget looking for a no nonsense phone the Moto G and Men is your best bet

 Been using this phone for over a day now Rose 1)Brilliant display 2)Awesome camera 3)Smooth Performance 4)Great value for money 5)Feels really good in your hand 6)Motorola Migrate got the phone ready to roll in 5 minutes from my old samsung.
 7)SD card slot unto 32 by os Even with a 5 inch screen it isn too big to handle
 Must the right size
 Sons all be nitpicking here co there agent many
 Os 1)The front panel is both left right and top bottom symmetrical and this happened to me more than 5 times in the last 24 hours Shone lying on a surface face up
 Licks it up and presses where the power button should be only to find it missing
 When realise that ism holding the phone upside down
 When I wanted to switch from landscape to portrait orientation and i lip the phone 90 degrees and display doesn changes
 Took me a while to realise that I was again holding it upside down
 His takes a bit getting used to
 The only indication in the front panel is the front camera which you may not notice if your phone is black 2)No USB cable supplied
 PROS >>> CONS os MUST BUY

 I ordered this mobile with In a day guarantee It didn even reach me after 42 hrs.I did not even get message that the shipment was delayed
 Even being in a metropolitan city they take more than 42 hours to deliver a shipments
 i wonder how they got 1 billion dollar funding
 Stop advertising and promising things you can deliver
 Pathetic logistic service
 I even wonder if those reviews were written by people working for flipkart.

 I ordered this phone on th or sept and received this phone on with septa
 When I opened the box and turned os the phone I found its touch was not working
 I can understand how can so called worldwide recognized company like Motorola can deliver a product without minimum QA.
 Its and time I stopped from Flipkart and this time again I was disappointed st time they have delivered me wrong product and this time they have send me faulty/unusable products dont know Of all be able to convince myself to buy again from Flipkart.

 I have purchased both the versions of the Moto G on launch day
 By previous phone was the Motorola Defy Plus bought 2 years ago
 I bought the first gen phone for my wife
 I got this for myself
 teres my views on the various aspects Form Factor I prefer the form factor of the st gen Moto G as its easier to use single handed and more pocket friendly
 Display The display of the st gen Moto G is brighter has better sunlight flexibility and has more saturated colours
 The and gen Moto G display is not as good as the st gen one
 Storage The and gen Moto G is better due to the micro card sloth
 His is what prompted me to buy it
 I had a few issues migration data from my Defy Flush
 The Migrate pp copied all my media files to the internal storage of the Moto Os
 When the Storage setting Love media to os card memory didn move my video to the os cards
 I used os Mile Explorer to move my video from internal memory to the os cards
 All Quality Excellent as always with Motorola honest
 General Usage Smooth like before due to stock Android.
 him not a heavy multi-tasker and 1 os RAM still seems enough for me
 Media Consumption Watching video and playing games is better on the and gen Moto G due to the bigger screen
 Studio quality is good but him surprised that PowerAmp sounded better on my Defy Flush
 The bundles music player sounds better than PowerAmp on the Moto Os him not sold on the sterno speaker functionality in the new Moto Os
 I think the 2 silver bars just spoil its looks and dont sound as loud in a noisy environment
 Camera The camera in the and gen Moto G have been upgrade from the st gen one
 I haven extensively tested the camera - its a feature I dont use much
 It looks os to me but I wouldn be surprised if its not as good as the competition
 Motorola has always lagged in the camera department
 Battery Life The and gen Moto G keeps the same battery as the st gen one after increasing the screen size
 Os the battery life is not so good just average
 Charger: Motorola still bundles the same bakers charger in the new Moto Os
 To USB cable only 550mA charging rate
 I still use my Defy Plus charger which is much better - has a detachable USB cable and 850mA charging rate
 In summary providing expandable memory on the new Moto G was a good moved
 However they should have at least put a bigger battery and bundles a decent charger with a detachable USB cable
 I would rate it 3.5/5 but him rounding it to 4.

 os Motorola has the reputation and now its backed by Google.
 os Xiaomi is completely Chinese they are giving away these low cost mi devices to stoop data if you do not believe it goose this you will know how xiaomi is stealing user data
 Indian government is not realizing this yet from huawei to ate to xiaomi all steal data for more information lets compare SOC used by Xiaomi Semi Os and Moto G both versions Redmi1S has 1.6 z MSM8228, Had More for Indian version which has HSUPA (3G data fast for unloading your data There as Moto G has 1.2 The Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Had More has HSDPA (3G for faster data downloading West its unto you guys... Money Matters

 Rose os Good Screen good to watch movies/videos took
 Have Nexus 5 Full HD, comparatively os screen does look that bad
 os Comes with Good Moto Pp like Moto Assist
 They seem to be pretty useful
 os Camera is awesome os Round quality is much better
 Sons os Shone still feels plasticky, but not entirely bad os Must 1 os RAM for the price.3)
 Battery back is just oka Didn't last a day for me had to charge in the evening again
 Overall I am happy I bought the phone

 First let me thank Flipkart for its tonic speed delivery of Moto G and Men Ordered at 12 Midnight and got it by 10 AM.... Coming back to Moto G and Men phone looks premium and also feels premium
 Vice upgrade from Moto G but could have added more juice to battery and display
 Rose Shone look and feel is very good Voice Camera front & rear Smooth touch response Flag free processing *Awesome speakers and call voice clarity is also very good os inch screen but still handy to use Sons Volume & power buttons not handy to press Display is not very sharp as 5 inch but still 720P Battery could have been better least 2500 may Overall the Moto G and Men is awesome upgrade to its predecessor Moto G except few minor pitch hence rating it 4 stars...!!!
 Of you are looking mid range smart phone this should be considered in top 3 choicest

 The device feels amazing in your hands and has a very elegant design
 The rear camera is capable of taking pretty descent images in low light as well
 The front camera is good for selfies.Altough no degradation in the processor dissappints.
 But overall the device is worth a buy , if you dont trust china companies just like me

 Of you are looking for a good value for money smartphone that does not skin on features you are looking at the right phone in the and Generation Avatar of Moto Os
 Os usual ordering and delivery from Flipkart was convenient and super fast
 Ordered at 10:45am received at 4:00pm.
 Coming to the phone itself the package ships with wired headset(earplug+mic) and a charger with a detachable micro USB cable
 Unlike the reviews read online for units sold in Europe the unit in India ships with Charger and wired headset.
 Its too early to comment on battery life and charger performance
 Screen is bright and clear - os size is convenient to use as a phone and for internet usage
 Inclusion of a micro card slot is an added advantage over the previous version
 The call quality in my limited use till now since laying hands on the phone has been pleasing and very good
 The speaker performance is also good
 The unit supports dual him and takes micro SIMs.
 I have set up SIM1 for my official him and SIM2 for my personal number and data usage
 In the first boots the unit prompt you asking which of the SIMs you wish to set for data/interconnect.
 Met to test out the camera - but given that its an improvement in specification over the previous st gen Moto Os i expect the camera performance to be good as well
 Supports Os - LTE support is still missing in this version
 The back side of the phone has kind of smooth matter like finish - its not glossy
 Further its not fully flat but slightly curved at backside.
 Holding it is comfortable
 I felt the phone feels slightly heavy in comparison to having held the Nexus os Galaxy Note kind of honest
 One of the accessories were available at the time of ordering
 To the the big sales pitch of 50% off on accessories on the st day of ordering was no help
 Would not notice any annoying sons till now
 Shall update this review after a few days of usage
 Overall an excellent value for money budget phone that does not skin on features
 To far well pleased with what I paid for

 I give 5 stars to both Flipkart and Motorola.
 About service Ordered this around 12:10 am (06 Kept and it was there in my hand by 12 PM.
 Thanks to Flipkart.
 And the Shone I was using Nexus 4 till 2 days back and now for me Moto G and Men is really awesome.
 Fig screen , good performance and built in stereo.. its just worth buying
 Price is comparatively lesser os However War phone is worst and even charger doesn seem of good quality
 That can be adjusted as that justified with the low prices

 Ordered a new moto g and gen at 12.00 am when the sale began
 Was very excited to get the phone
 I have the moto guest genu as well
 os After i received the the new phone i unvexed it and the st thing i did was to switch on the phone i noticed that the power & volume buttons were not up to the mark in terms of build quality when compared to the earlier moto g that i have
 2)After the phone was booted the phone seemed fine in terms of display
 But in comparison with the earlier moto go i played a same os video on both phone simultaneously
 Os expected the video the video quality on the moto go was not great due to the resolution of this phone
 The viewing angles on the earlier moto g was very good due to its higher ppi..!!
 The color contrast on the new moto g is not as good as the earlier moto g as well
 3)The rd point that i noticed on the new moto g2(2nd genu was when i put both the phone both moto g & go on AUTO brightness mode the new phone screen looked very dull in comparison with the moto go
 The earlier moto g is very bright and crisp
 4)The new moto go feels really good to hold in hand and feels lighter but its actually little heavier than the old one
 5)The camera is pretty good on the go
 The flash on the older moto g was lot brighter than the new one 6)Sound quality is pretty good on the moto g than the go
 7)The os card slot is a major advantage in the go
 After using it for couple of days its showing os card damaged
 The camera and gallery did not open itself when i had put the os cards Wont know if the device that I have has an issue or all of them r facing the same issue
 I switched off the phone put the sd card again n reported it
 It worked fine
 There is some issue with the os card sloth Needs a fix os Overall it a pretty ok phone for ask but could have been a lot better in terms of the hardware specs..!! Also i like the way Flipkart ships the products os Delivery & support is good os

 MUMBAI:Ordered this phone on th sept 12.05 am got delivery on th septa
 CONS: 1)The phone which i got had some display issue in Slide window moment work 5 on 10 times so to make it functional i have to press lock key ,unlock the device and then wipe down the slide window
 os To upgrade in Charger same as moto G just 550mA insufficient to charge 2070 may battery.MOTOROLA SHOULD HAVE SOME SENSE BEFORE INCLUDING os os PACKAGING.
 3)Headsets are also same as MOTO G no major changes which are useless
 os Battery less than moto G which had 4.5inch display,SO LESS BATTERY BACKUP os LED modifications only white colour,dosent work
 have to download third party pp
 os Gaming:ASPHALT 8 clashes basic
 games work fine os In United States it costs $180 (apprx rs10800/-) but packing contains only USB.
 To power adapted and Headsets.
 os I have noticed sometimes apiece moment work so have to start the device again and again PROS: 1)Display (HD 720p) 2)Improved Camera imp rear,2mp front 3)Stereo Speaker in front
 os Useful default apes like : Moto Alert,Moto Assist... Disclaimer I have used MOTO Os and the above review summarize the issues I faced with the device
 It is not my intention to blame the product or the seller
 Reccomendations:Use samson Charger and Samsung headsets for better performance

 Good phone for 13000.
 But i would still prefer the Not G earlier one
 I am still using that and this new one was purchased for my wife
 By preference would be Moto G the earlier version
 Reason : Good battery life and music quality good on Moto G earlier model

 I bought my Moto G and Men on th September 2014, and today on must September 2014 it has failed to recognize any him from both him card shots and this reason stands for this punitive rating of this phone by me but if this would not have happened I would have rate it with a 4 not 5 because sometimes it lags).
 The phone and its build quality and overall performance is excellent according to prices

 The phone looks good and fine to hold
 But I found a lot of major issues with my phone
 1. the phone speaker was crackling , even for simple moto ratification ringtone.
 when you receive a call , the phone ringtone is heard after a long delay of say 10 sense
 3. while charging , the ratification LED does not come ON.
 For when charge complete
 4. charger supplied is very poor quality , only 550mA.
 Takes long time to charge
 His phone requires minimum 1 A charge 5.Phone looks very symmetrical , so sometimes you end up holding it upside down when you get a call .
 there should have been a MOTO name on top
 display looks os and To lag.Battery life was good
 overall a good phone but dejected with sound quality which is like that of chinese honest
 Asked for a replacement 4 days back but still no response from flipkart.
 Looks like they have received lots of complaints regarding this cell , and waiting for update from MOTOROLA company
 The REPLACEMENT phone has an excellent and crisp display
 earlier one had a bit dull display
 The led ratification issue while charging is still there , may be its the same in all the honest
 DESPITE being an HTC ONE Os user , I am totally satisfied with this phone and its high quality
 Overall a must buy .
 Excellent quality for price.Flip Over makes it look like premium phone
 battery lasts for 2 and half days with substantial wife use

Anoop Kammaran
 First of all great service from Flipkart who delivered 2 days before the estimated date
 The package arrived in the best condition with the manufacturers seal intact
 I am waiting for the accessories to be available so that I can buy some of them
 Anyways, before I talk about the phone let me tell you where I come from
 I have been a steady fan of Foka Symbian phone and have been extremely skeptically of Android and the phone they come in
 I have been using a Foka 5800 for many years and then I had tried the Bony Peri In for some time and I didn like it(very low battery performance and too buggy android).
 Os I had moved back to Foka Symbian by buying the Foka 808 Review and had been using it for the last couple of years
 Os finally after hearing so much good into about Motorola phone as well as the new Android versions I decided to give it a try and since goose owns Motorola now(although temporarily and since the technical speck to price ratio is insanely on the good side for consumers I bought this new Moto-G.
 First impressions
 His phone is big with a big screen
 By earlier 808 was of size inch and for some strange reason I expected the Moto-G to be not different by this much
 Anyways, this size is the maximum I can handle for a phone at-least based on my palm size
 People with bigger hands will find this more comfortable to use
 The 720p display looks good
 I have seen Sony's much hoped Triluminous Arabia lowered display when I saw the Peri Z Ultra at a stores
 The Moto-G's screen appears to be just as good especially when you crank up the brightness
 Everything is perfectly clear and sharp and unless I look at it closely with a lens I would say this phone display is as good as apples retina display
 The touch response is very quick with lately that almost as low as the in devices(try playing drum apes in both and you'll see what I means
 The body of the phone appears to be well built and sturdy unlike the previous andros phone that I owned(same prices and one thing to note here is that the whole body is dust and finger-print resistant
 Motorola claims to have the gorilla glass 3 with this phone
 Looks like that good too Accidently put the phone in my pocket with my car keys and not a single went or scratch os The battery appears to last as Motorola claims unlike what I heard with the first generation Moto-Gs.
 I hope its not because this is the early days since purchase os Performance
 There is a big surprise here for me atleast.
 The data transfer between your external micro-SD card and the internal memory happens at 20MB/s.
 I saw this when I tried copying my music from my micro-SD card to the internal memory so as to format the card using the phone
 The stock andros doesn come with a file manager in this phone
 Os I use this rd party file manager called os Mile Explorers
 The quad-core CPU appears to be great giving no laws on os video playback and gazing
 Although I wouldn recommend trying to run big compressed os video as it canst handle it
 For gazing I tried running NFS hot Pursuit and it worked great
 Works exactly as how it does in my iPad.
 Android Mitka is way better in terms of performance than Belly Mean or ICS and that transcend complimented by the quad-core CPU.
 Os to concluded the and Men Moto-G is the best phone you can ever get for that price in the market
 To other phone in that price range is even close
 Os its a must buy for anyone who is looking for a decent andros based smart-phone.
 I means based on what I see here one has to be almost crazy to go for the high-end models from leading manufacturers that are prices least 4-5 times the price of this phone
 It really shows how cheap the technology really is and how most manufacturers are overhanging for their products

 I am very much satisfied with the pace of delivery within 12 his without a new penny About phone Rose 1. Bigger display means more space but less fixed density 2. better and simpler UI than Moto G 3. Camera is upgrade and reloaded with new features 4. Two speakers 5. curve shape gives Letter grip and feels lighter although it is heavier 6. Micro os slot 7 K Google and Motorola Assist Context based Voice assistance works smoothly 8. Letter speakers 9. Dual miss for better voice quality .... Sons 1. Still User experience is not the best 2. To USB cable or memory card in box 3. On replaceable battery 4. Motorola Assist and K Google needs Internet idea
 Voice command is available when you are interest enabled

 Moto G It is almost certain that MOTO G is a great phone at this price point...nowadays it became a trend that last year flagships are becoming this years mid-range devices
 its true in the case of Moto G Delivery for the first time am disappointed with flipkart.I ordered the device on Friday midnight It was delivered to me by Monday night 9PM.Even though it reached my nearest hut on Saturday morning itself
 But of the box this device looks stunning,with the little upgrade from the previous version.they
 have compromised some PPI count,but is not the big deal at alloit looks same and sharp
 Device fits nicely in the hands comfortable to use it with single hand.Kitkat works smooth on the s400..nearly an year old chip set
 one notable upgrade is the front facing speakers.Its not only loud but the sound quality is very much improved
 next about the interface,Am not the lover of stock android,but 4.4 is smooth and stable.am
 happy that it can be customized to more user friendly.But I still miss my HTC sense experience which is more user friendly than the stock
 Its good to have dual him support but as of my experience it takes more time for the device to recognize both the him cards.For a moment I thought it was a problem but it is not
 Am yet to test the device performance on gaming and heavy usage,but I believe it wont disappoint me as the original Moto G performed really well
 And the next big thing camera Moto has added an 8 os shorter with this,and its a good upgrade from the original one,it takes some nice snaps.Cam quality is better than some old flagships with 8MP shooter.am
 very much satisfied with the shorter
 one notable thing with the shorter is that its bit faster than the old one,and touch to snap is very handy.selfy
 cam is also good
 Battery am bit disappointed that no upgrade to the battery.Am sure this phone will not perform as good as the previous one as the screen size increased and the port for os is included.but
 it will last for a day with normal usage
 Moto offers a Charger and the ear piece with this phone,but they are not as class as the phone charger cable can be separated,and the headphone perform really poor
 Most users have a confusion whether to buy Moto or MI3.
 It depends on what you expect from the phone
 but Deep one thing in mind "MOTO g is a mid range phone with the flagship Quality and MI3 is flagship with mid range quality
 although MI3 has a greater chip-set it feels cheap in hands have used both the devices,Moto G feels like holding a flagship,and in case of MI3 i felt like holding a Basis calculator.
 MI3 is good on paper.but
 Moto feels much better in hands
 MI3 has almost double the amount of pipes than of MOTO but still moto G beats it comfortably.remember
 MOTO is only 720p.its far better than the Chinese
 Of you need an uncompromisable daily driver then its good to buy MOTO Os if u believe in paper specie you can go for the Chinese."

 The phone is good and have nice camera
 It is too difficult to open back panel to insert SIM, upon 5-6 attempt of opening back panel may harm charger point
 I would advise the phone should be little light and phone SIM location needs to be related to external part of phone
 The Matter back does not show any outstanding life i would say its os phone but not premium
 The phone is not that responsive and touch screen does not responds 100% all the time

 But we also need unable phones.. Its display glass is very very cheap when compared to other phone such as samson Bony etc

 Dear Buyers Consider this review before buying on FK!!
 I got a defective piece from FKers!! 1. Full Battery charge is not giving more than 3.5 his 2. Shone is getting heated up in wrist while talking
 Complained to os on the same by pressing return button two times on webster
 They closed two tickets
 By giving instructions of some exercise
 Did the same as instructed but there is no improvement in the mobile phone behavior
 Learned 3 things by spending 12999 on FK! One Flipkart will not replace your phone even if it is defective
 Two They are interested in closing Rickets not on the problem solving
 Three spending 5 digits of money on os will never get back Common manes interests is the opportunity to make money not their CONCERNS!!!'

 Its time for new moto g & it did not disappoint me
 Have been using it for last 9 days & i am writing down what i felt when used this phone
 Moto g comes with pretty clean & simple package & not to forget no USB cable & if or first to andros devices u might get disappointed for not having a cable
 The design of the moto is very elegant & it comes with a screen guard on the phone so no need to buy one
 Display is pretty sharp & crisp & viewing angels are also pretty good
 Processor works pretty fast on g or wife with no laws whatsoever after dating all the preinstalled apes & downloading lot of apply
 its almost stock andros & 4.4.4
 mitka out of the box comes with some cool apes like photo newsstand, to name a few not to forget the Ui is simple & clean which I loved
 Home is the default brother & works brilliantly & the new UI of come is also interesting
 Os usual it comes with moto apes like alert migrate assist all does the job as said
 I am not a gaming person so i am not going to say anything about it since i haunt played any games but i believe snapdragon 400 can handle all the games designed for it
 All quality is also very good both loud speaker & microphone without any problem one can hear the voice of other person
 Motorola has supplied a very average headset, intact its below average
 By old phone Galaxy s lcd had better headset undoubtedly
 Most of the customers would be disappointed with this quality of headset.
 Quality of audit is very less & sometimes i find it difficult to realise which song is playing while I am riding on my two wheeler
 But moto backs it up by beautiful front sterno speakers they are absolutely brilliant & enjoyed every bit of it
 Yes charger do get heated up a bit but folks if u had used samson phone previously use samson charger to charge the moto I have personally checked the capacity of both samson & moto charger & both supply same amount of power or less in case of samsung) u can check the specification on or charges
 & guess what phone doesn get heated up when charged by samson charge
 I have been doing it from last 9 days
 Battery is pretty decent & it comes for a whole day with normal usage
 I get a back up of almost a day which is fine for me
 however one can change their auntie from davis to ART in developer option for better battery response
 Dual him for those who love to have two aims & both work pretty well signal strength is also very good
 It also comes with the micro sd slot so more space for heavy storage
 Camera also works very well both rear & front camera photos looked much better in non HDR mode personal preference It also supports 720p video recording & it also boots slow motion video 2 720p which is quiet awesome.
 Overall I really like the new moto g & i have enjoyed every bit of it

 Flipkart replaced the phone after several attempts and the new phone looks good
 The first phone I bought was faulty I would have expected flipkart to replace the phone during the first attempt

 Were are my Review --- - Battery - It takes nearly3-4 his to charge and lost in 7-8 Mrs if constantly accepting internet than in 5 Mrs Tax
 os Mile Manager is not available To to access files or create holders you need to download other Pp - Drive is totally communication based on internet
 --1 os RAM but it seems RAM is always full .
 I was using 500 RAM always 200 os available same here only 200 os available
 Most concern is battery os Of you are free whole day to charge and use then go for it...
 But I think Online purchase is not good for electronic equipment's... like Mobile and Captors tax and all....

 Certainly it a good looking phone and has overcome certain limitations of the previous phone But i found it to be average due to my personal experiences 1.
 It took more than 3 hours to get complete Charged 2. When i download and played a high graphics game it was awesome but it lasted for only 7 minutes after which the phone automatically switched off due to zero Battery
 I guess Moto needs to work on battery...:)

 The moment i opened the box i felt i was holding a very premium phone which might be costing around 25k-30k.
 I had that feel in my hand
 The phone is super awesome as the moto-g(1st Men and the cam quality had been increased a lot and that a very good job done in this phone
 I have purchased a motor for myself and a motor for my mon and now i have purchased this new edition for my brow
 Now my whole family is holding moto devices
 He are all very happy using the device
 I have been using my motor from 9 months i have purchased the global grm version in US) and seriously there want even a small pitch and the same from motor from 4 months and same continues with the new motor i hope so
 Regarding the speck i dont need to say much everything is perfectly blend for this price range and handset.
 May be there might be companies offering you other features or increased capability but i am sure that for the price we paid this motor lasts long than other devices
 People who want quality , performance , proper service battery life conductivity and pure andros experience this is the best buy at this price range
 Flipkart u always make me happy
 Ordered at 9:32 os on th sept got it delivered by 6:20PM on th sept with no extra cost BGLR-HYD).
 Buds to flipkart.
 The only problem is the cost of the back panel
 Of they are reduced to a large extent then many would opt buying original shells or cases

 Were is my Review covering the entire ex of buying and using it trying to be non partial and practical
 os Service/Delivery- Looked it in Midnight delivered at pm next day but m passed with FLIPKART and thus had a long Nail chain of complain back and forth regarding the issue that they (EKART) do not provide the into of courier person who will deliver the products
 I ask you guns do you want to stay all day in home just become of a courier that too on a sunday well you have too co there is no phone number of EKART on internet and flipkart says that dont have it either
 os MOTO Os Packaging- Very very simple,looks like a budget cut in the box
 os USB Cable so they are assuming you already have one .!!!! (-0.5)
 Headphone looks very ave so i did not even gathered to try them out
 os DESIGN- 5 star no doubt about it the phone as soon as i took out of the box fell in love with it
 M using nexus 4 right now and this phone is so light and feels safer in hand the back panel white is rubber type material which is good will avoid finger print marks
 although the weight is also an issue co at times i felt like its a TOY rather than a phone
 os Display same a pre moto Os
 I am happy with the display with the amount of money i paid os Storage 5 star for adding External storage
 32GB os Camera - Disappointed 8MP, u bidding me
 By very OLD Samsung Os took amazing pick with 8MP.
 its more of a imp camera
 The images are whitish and washed out the front cam is even worse
 could have been way better
 os BATTERY- charging is looking slow to me will wait and watch how it goes
 os Performance - Its Stock andros and with Had core 400 chip its working better than i expected
 no last and very smooth .
 though i dont like the 4.4 icon in pp drawer
 looks to big os Round Round are really good front facing dual speaker are just very well tuned
 10) call reception its funny that people now talk and concern about call quality in the end well my first call came from home and mothers voice always sound great
 call quality is really good os 11) Met speed Low on wife , will have to check how Os works
 12) RESULT : 4 start out of 5 and +0.5 for the awesome back panel curve design
 For me looks matter 70% in a phone and 30% specie
 so Thus up for Moto Os Surely it do not match with 14000 xii mind but i did not like that phone design and its stupid to first register than wait and try to book at 2pm...its just happy process
 its just a phone not my life,,so will pass mid for now,,, hope you guns find it useful

 First thing first.... Ordered the phone in night @ 2 os with standard delivery mode... had the phone in my hand 8 hours later by 10 AM....so 5 stars to Flipkart..... Now about the phone.....
 It this price range MotoG2 has intense competition
 I myself searched through an amazing range of choicest but in the end decided for MotoG2 for the simple reason that the quality does matter over specs....
 The phone definitely loose out to competition on the point of lesser ram older processor lesser PPI and smaller battery capacity.... but it all becomes meaningless as soon as you start the phone... Its a far product with no last very easy to use... simple clean and very functional interface both physical and software wise... battery life has been good so far.... camera does its job nice but could definitely have been better.....
 I have been a very heavy and advanced user of phone some of them have been of the highest specie and now all I want from my phone is to have a responsive functional and unable experience with a good camera and good battery while not burning my purse... in that respect nobody can beat this phone at this price..... would highly recommend this phone if that wat you are looking for.....

 I bought this in December 2014.
 Not the product delivered even before the promised time of delivery even though the product was not in stock when I ordered
 Buds to Flipkart.
 I paid 13000 for this when I bought it
 It is worth every penny
 Latest Android OS.
 Fig screen but not too big
 Perfect hardware specie
 His has an 8MP camera and I am not much amazed at the clarity of the pictures that I have taken with the phone
 Real value for money
 Will this day I have not experienced any trouble with the phone except the battery life which too holds good for one day without fail
 Given the fact that is how all Android phone work I should not be complaining about this

 The biggest positive about this phone are os Its your budget os Backs a punch in terms of performance and design Though there may be minor glitches, this phone is surely one of the best Android phone available
 Motorola has built up quite a following by releasing andros phone like Moto G and Moto Os To for it if you are new to Android or you want a great specification in the 10000 budget range

 The features of this phone is best in the segment but once it encounters any problem then you will understood why motorola has no prior outlets
 By phone is in one of their service centers from th september and my problem is still not resolved
 Their customer support team has stopped responding to my calls
 His is the worst experience i have received from any company
 Please make sure if you want to buy this mobile then your house must be near to service center

 with June 2015 I have received the phone.After one and half month I got issue with the display and battery over heating
 His is the st time I have purchased Motorola phone and my experience with motorola is really BAD.
 However I understand electronic item some time it wont works.But another bad experience I faced from service centre,JOB os : AMSBAG004387, date must Dug they promised it will be repaired by 3-4 working days.But I checked with them today(11/09/2015) I got a reply that they have dred for the display from Lumbar Order Os POJBAG001242,31st Dug 2015) and they have no idea when they will receive that.And today is with Rep 2015, still I haven received my phone,dont know when I will get that phone
 I tried to contact customer care via phone and the response is really surprising .
 "SERVER DOWN" they canst help(2nd time I got this response
 Faulty device ok Had service is not acceptable
 I feel motorola has a strong consumer base in Indian but why they are troubling the customer like this
 I am unable to contact anyone because of my phone is in service centre for last 15 days
 I feel if anyone purchasing Motorola phone he has to keep additional phone because God knows when the Moto will get out of order
 It incur to monetary loss as well as personal loss and its incomparably with any amount of money
 I feel Motorola is deviating from its saline Hello Motor to To Fellow Hope you understand a consumer sentiment and start acting upon this proactive.
 To expectation from Motorola, there is no zero(0) rating else I would have given that
 One last things if you are purchasing MOTO, purchase one extra phone cause by chance or MOTO is out of order then no once can guarantee you that when u will get or phone from service center
 I am staying in retro city I can imagine if the service in retro is like this what how worst would be the service in tried 2 city

 While Flipkart might pride itself on its great valuation and discount sales ( i think it is doing a great disservice to customers all over India)...Here are some of the reasons why... 1.While I did receive a Moto G phone as part of an offer to exchange my old phone - Am am sure that old phone which was in working condition would last longer than the product it has been exchanged for
 2. For those who dont know anything about the old phone i changed it was already 4 years old so saying it would last longer than the new phone is a PRETTY BIG STATEMENT INDEED!!) 3. Flipkart will wash its hands off you once the device is sold
 4. Now onto the problems of the phone it was a completely dysfunctional piece which was taken to the service center for the st time because the screen was completely irresponsible - That did the service center do they said its a software issue could be fixed and returned the phone to me in a couple of days
 5.
 That same day the problem persist I take it again to the service center(this time they say the screen might need to be changed 6. Stuck without a phone I agreed they said it would take a week however 3 1/2 weeks later I got my phone 7. Hoping that all was finally well and I could get back to normal was the only illusion I had
 8.
 That same day...AGAIN the same problem began to crop up...and as usual I went to the service center to show it to them - His time they said its probably the mother board issue
 Were is my question to the service center in nearly a month you couldn figure out what we did in a few hours
 Of it was the mother board issue and the screen issue and the software issue well that pretty much sums up the whole damn phone now doesn the
 And what is the solution for that
 another repair and another tragedy BTW for all the prospective customers stay away from this product it is just not worth it...and for those wondering why were there so many issues did I drop the phone or anything like that the answer is NO, this is what came out of the box!!.... Motorola's Moto G is a horrible horrible phone that can only be made worst by a seller who wants no responsibility with the device a careless service center that doesn know what to do with the products its supposed to fix....but most of all by a dead beat organization that cannot take care of its customers interest
 - Met to hear from Motorola _ will be taking them to Consumer Court - A lost customer

Abhilash Srini...
 His is THE best smartphone you will find in this range
 First let me convince you that you wont end up owning a faulty piece
 Even I was a little skeptically when I read some of the other reviews
 Act is some products an infinitesimally small percentage end up with a hardware/software flaw
 West assured Flipkart's return policy is trustworthy and efficient
 Secondly about the phone
 I have checked all the features of the phone that a layman can
 Absolutely no last the speakers are awesome; perfectly good microphone and I could fall in love with the touch
 In the software side when I bought this phone the Lollipop upgrade had already been incorporated (5.0.2), and the UI is pretty good
 I could go on about this but you get the idea
 To for it

 I ordered MOTO Os phone on 12 March,2015, I receive my phone on 18 March 2015.Thanks flipkart for faster delivery
 By phone had got black dot on display in the month of April so I lost opportunity to return the phone for the bad quality of it
 When after three month I found that microphone has stopped working
 both occurred at different time....Even though when I had gone to service center Sugar sales Ahmadabad on date 7 July 2015) at there one of executive told me its a liquid damage and your microphone can not be repaired under warranty
 In fact black dot on display appear about a three month ago and microphone stopped working after three month in July .
 But the person from service center told me that it can not be repaired under warranty
 I also talked with customer care executive about the clarification regarding my problems but they are not giving satisfactory answer to me
 They are now ignoring my problem saying that " we are sorry for your inconvenience
 Your phone can not be repaired
 I am really frustrated from services of Motorola.They are not even solving the problem of microphone
 To which kind of warranty they are giving
 its really very annoying
 One of executive put my call on hold Without notifying me
 Again really frustrated
 His was my first phone with MOTOROLA and now it seems to be last
 Os I stated my problems above really want to tell the people that wont even think MOTOROLA service centers are good or worth solving problems
 wont go for MOTOROLA seeing that they have good quality service stations

 Replaced 3 phone in 1 both & 1 Shone in 1 month = 4 Shone in 2 Months All the phone had display issue
 The th Shone had display issue that came up 30 days replacement policy from FK, Hence had to go to service center to get the display replaced
 The worst display quality manufactured by Motorola or who ever it is
 To other issue faced apart from the display problems West all works perfect
 Think many times before you buy this peace of JUNK.
 Display is the important factor in any phone

 There is no doubt this is a great phone in this price range
 I used it for about 3 months,when my flash light stopped working.So I went to the service center they told me to keep my phone for 10-12 days to repair the things
 But now,after almost three weeks,they tell me that my phone motherboard is being replaced
 And the thing is need to go to the service center almost everyday for or phone as if u r asking for a big favour...
 They gave me two numbers to contact the center...but I literally tried 100 times but still they just dont reply... Motorola,Are u listening???

 Purchased a Moto G and Men on with June
 Received the product on with June
 Used the phone for couple of hours and the issue with screen/unlock started
 Basically once the phone screen goes in standby mode and you try to bring the screen up by pressing the power button the screen doesn come up
 Of you get a call on the cell the screen doesn come up
 Display remains shut
 Raised a return request immediately on with June 12:23 am
 Return request - 22597457.
 Since then Flipkart team is trying to call me and give a remote diagnostic of the issue which has not gone through
 5 calls so far and for one or other reason the call is not getting resolved
 It 3:55 pm I got latest call from technical team
 The call did not complete due to network issue
 Next thing I notice is the return request is rejected with message The issue has been resolved between you and the seller
 Hence there will be no replacement or refund.".
 The itself did not get through and this ridiculous explanation for concealing my return request
 Immediately I have created another return request no 22799982.
 Gets hope this gets resolved with it
 Most dissatisfied with Flipkart service
 wont even want to give 1 start

Shaimay Shah
 I bought this phone on the with of June and received it on the 13th.
 It worked well for the first few hours and then I realised that the battery was draining extremely quickly
 os in every 2-3 minutes
 That technically meant that it would run out juice in about 3 hours
 I tried factory data resecting it but it did not help at all
 I then called the Motorola Service Enter located in the unheard regions of Gurgaon.
 They told me to bring the phone to their center and they would check it
 That they forgot to mention was that I was supposed to back up my phone before I went there
 And that was fine because I quickly backed it up at the center
 But what was baffling was that these guns forgot to tell me that they could not touch the phone for the first thirty days because I could easily get it replaced
 To I quickly called the Flipkart Helpline and they told me that I would get a call from their technical team at a designate time in my case it was 3:07pm).
 But my woes had only begun
 In the call I specifically told them to change the number they should call to the cell that I owned instead of the one that belonged to my relative
 Well guess what
 They called on the other number
 And that number was unteachable
 Os their computer rescheduled the call to the next day without the consent from anyone
 I called their helping again and they told me that it want in their hands because their server would assign times to calls
 I again told them to change the number they should call
 And guess what no surprises), they called the old number again
 Luckily this time the call was directed to my cells
 The supposed technical guy through the smartcheck pp checked the phone from Bangalore and said that there want any problem with it
 He then asked me to carry forward a series of diagnostic steps
 He told me to go to settings>apps and then stop all of the applications running there
 *Claps* now like I did not try that
 After that he told me to go to fastboot mode and rest the phone
 Flaps Again Now And of course it didn work
 To I called the customer service yet again and told them that it did not work and that I wanted a refund immediately
 But yet again I was put on the 'callback' list
 I AGAIN told them to change the number they called
 And yet again they called on the other number
 His time I had the other phone with me so I picked it up and again talked to the technical guy
 I had to tell him everything again and he asked me if I had visited the service center
 I told him that I did
 He informed me that he would call the service center and then would call me back and then hung up
 I waited for 20 minutes for the call and then I YET AGAIN called the flipkart helpline.
 The lady on the line wouldn understand what I was trying to say and was fixed on the idea of schelling another call with the technical team
 They told me I would get the call by the end of the day
 Os I waited till 8 and there was still no call
 I called them again and they told me that my request had been canceled due to some reason
 After going through four or five layers of positions I reached the head
 The head told me that they had called the service center and the service center had told them that we hadn gone there
 That kind of cap is this
 And after arguing for some time they again put me on the list for another call from the technical team
 him going to get that call tomorrow and hopefully now the next guy has some sense

 His phone is pathetic m using this phone since last 5 months and i must say it is the worst phone i have ever used in my life
 Shone have heating problems i can play games on it it hangs very badly carts watch moves on it due to heating problems bad call quality
 I have visited service center 3-4 times all times they just say problem will solved but there is no such improvement and now they are not going to replace my phone as they are not able to rectify the problems
 To this is my advice to all PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PHONE EVER.
 dont waste or hard earned money on this phone

ChandraShekhar...
 Of you are looking to buy a first smartphone, dont consider this one
 It is a very degraded product by motorola.
 They are killing their brand value by manufacturing this type of devices
 Took for some other alternative
 Rose 1.) Good camera quality in daylight
 2.) Grand Same motorola.
 Sons 1.) Door touch sensitivity
 2.) Door call quality
 3.) Door battery backup.
 4.) Charging takes a lot of time
 5.) RAM management is worst
 Actual list is quite long but this may suffice at the moment
 wont Buy it even if they are selling it for sky
 I had it replaced from flipkart 2 times third time i asked for my money back
 They were quite suppurative of this
 Of you tell them what the problem really is they sometimes actually listen to it

 I purchase this phone with pre-installed lollipop version and the next day i found a serious problems
 there will not be any sound coming when i dial or receive a call
 i will not not be able to hear even the dial tone or ring tone
 the other person on the call will be able to hear every things
 After some de-bugging i found that removing and re-inserting the SIM card will solve the problem
 But this problem was persisting so i asked for the replacement
 In the new hands after 2 days same problem came !!!!
 I was shocked to find the same problem again
 His time phone switch OFF and os was solving the problem but again the problem was persisting
 Also i found that once the phone battery indicator showing remaining battery as os even though 5 min back it was at 50%. after switch off and on again it started showing 50%.
 Also the gesture tying was not working
 All this problem i encountered within 3 days of the getting the SECOND hands !!! Anyway i asked for the return of the phone and returned the phone
 after this i asked the people who have this phone what sort of problem they are facing
 i found that every one of them is facing some or other problems
 I have listed down the problems 1. Automatic call going to someone in your contact list
 2. Charger port not working after some usage 3. the pop up for SIM selection is not coming while dealing 4. the problems i have described above in my review About Flipkart: The delivery mechanism is good but when i asked for the replacement/return they first asked me to install an pp through which they will found whether the phone has problem or not the customer care person told withthis they can detect 99.99% of the problems !!!!!. then every hands maker can use the same pp and there will not be any defect !!!!!.
 Flipkart customer care should not ask this and make any such false claims

 I bought this product and after 1 months I found that the phone is hanging so many times and it is unable to use but flipkart only allow to return the product within a month this is frustration because if problem occurs after 1 month or just completion of a month than no one will be able to request for return of the product.this is the frequent issue that is occurring in moto g next gen as many of my friends complaint about it

 I ordered it on May 19th, 2015 nd received it on May 21st.
 To Full rating to Service
 Before order I read reviews of other customers nd get little depressed by some of them but as I didn see no any other option I ordered it
 In last 25 days my experience with this phone...
 It dropped from my hand about 3-4 times and once in bucket full of water but it is still working
 To better hardware and Somewhat water proof
 Round quality is better than my previous Samsung phone
 Display is pretty good
 Sometimes camera quality lacks in dim lights but this issue can be solved using HDR mode
 Letter design noise cancellation etc etc
 The only thing I hate about this phone is that Motorola does not provide USB cable along with this phone
 So..Overall 4 stars

 I bought this mobile from Filpkart actually got greedy looking at an offer few days back
 Stem delivered was faulty speaker was not working properly and was very noisy
 Tired calling Flipkart but no proper response was given by very cordial representatives
 I have got almost 4-5 calls till now but there is no resolution
 Not worth buying from Flipkart!!!

 People are mesmerising by the phone that its the best mid range device bah black
 After hearing so much about the device i decided to buy it
 first of all i just hate lollipop.
 Besides that here are some points 1.
 In the box we dont get USB which is an important part
 The wire of charger is non-detachable.
 Besides that the charger is of very low quality
 It takes 5:30 hours to charge the phone
 whereas the device is fully charged in 2 hours by samson or sonya charge
 2. Earphones are worth rubles 100/- in local market
 Completely absurd earphones.
 3. Performance is not unto the mark
 Its being 10 days after using the phone and the device hangs sometimes
 4. Touch is sticky
 While wiping any unwanted pp or anything gets open due to sticky touch 5.
 To direct Music access
 For direct shortest you have to make a playlist in goose music and then in widest the shortest for playlist is available
 6. Drowsing experience is horrible in goose chromic
 7. Keyboard is bad it may be bad for me only
 I am using Swift keyboard now
 8.
 To built file manager
 Must be download from playstore.
 9.
 I have left spending time on facebook through pp boy its horrifying.
 ( That is an advantage actually os ) so in my opinion Samsung Os neo is far better than this device.The all above sons are absent in S3.
 I have used Os neo for 1 year and it never hanged NEVER.
 After using moto go s neo looks like an under-priced phone with lot of features attractive interface and inaccessibility and most important ease of handling

 By cell touch screen not working
 Complaint has been registered five times for replacement flipkart do not respond
 Flipkart person say that it is your problems
 They just phone and say do like this do like that
 I had factory rest my phone 2 times still the problem continues
 The flipkart person do not respond at all
 Now i think flipkart cells duplicate product and the 30 days replacement policy just sucks
 Flipkart persons do not give any response during the replacement
 His is all duplicate products

 I Friends His is my first Moto Hanndset, was little confused whether to buy Moto Os or Novo A7000 though I used Novo a6000 and now I already have a 5.5 inch fable Honor x that is very comfort to carry and one hand use
 To my obvious choose stands for 5 inch hands which I am use to for a longer period in form of Peri Z1.
 I decided to go for Moto Os especially to use pure andros with LOLLIPOP).
 Rose 1)Design- I am totally amazed with its look and feel superb to hold in hand
 the curve back panel looks premium and makes it quiet distinct from other cheap honest
 2)Processor- Snapdragon 400 chisel @ clock speed of 1.2 The with Only 1 os RAM.
 Though the Moto Os runs lawless on above chisel but it could have been better by improving clock speed and os 410 chipset.
 The RAM optimisation is quiet brilliant u will get almost 500 os RAM free on top of of Lollipop.
 os Camera The rear cam is equipped with 8 os and front is 2 MP.
 Both takes descent pick but u get some noiseless in captured pick when loomed in
 I slightly disappoint with it because Novo A6000 takes much brighter and noiseless pictures
 os Screen the 5 inch os screen is brighter and balanced color productive
 it is also protected by morning gorilla glass and eliminated with water coating
 5)Sound; The front faces dual sterno speaker gives a loud amount of sound
 The phone quality is also loud so you can hear properly in traffic and noisy area
 6)Battery: The battery back is little disappointed me its hardly sustain for a day
 only 8-9 hours of back you will get after moderate usage
 7)Storage: you are getting 12.8 os built storage out of 16 os and it can be expansile to os os via MSD cards
 To Were you can ask for more
 8)Operatin Sys.: The Lollipop update makes it Ice on the cake
 The moto Assist and Other lollipop features makes it Premium device
 Verdict I reviewed it after using 10 days and in my opinion if your budget is 10 to 12K then go for it despite of other cheap mobile which promises excellent on the paper but fail to deliver
 os star reduced for Camera......otherwise the phone stands taller in every aspect of the features.......

 The Products which are offered from flipkart are too defective the products replaced by others are being circulated now a days i bought A 6000 for which screen is damaged and next bought Us Cab for which the mother board is defective and replaced and next bought Moto G second generation that too motherboard complaint and needs one month time for the replacement my suggestion is better to buy on other webster we people have to first change and stop buying the products so they will be coming down with good products

 I requested Flipkart for the replacement and called service center for many times no one is responds well all the stupid persons says you will get the return call with in 24 hours
 Still now no one has called from flipkart i am only calling them daily and the same dialogue was coming from all the customer care persons
 Flipkart is having Stupid service and fraud company in this world

 I am very much disappointed that i made a choice to buy Moto Os from Flipkart.
 It was hanging very often... not connected to internet(3G data properly(tried with Airte;,Vodafone & BNSL) networks.........
 I had requested for return as it was within 30 days return policy
 but it was informed(SMS/email) that return was rejected from Seller(WS Retail).
 Nobody from Flipkart customer care can tell me the what is the reason the return request was rejected..... Now the phone is completely dead... not twitching on... i wasted ask on trusting FlipKart.... Will never buy any products from Flipkart !!!!

 I received an used product from Flipkart which does not live up to their standards
 I am not making this claim in air here are my analysis * Go go official web site and the Flikkart portal both say that the phone comes with KitKat and later upgradable to Android Os But Moto go I ordered came with Android L directly and no where in the Motorola or Flipkart webster it is mentioned
 Os do not have issues with phone per-installed with Android Os but no where it is mentioned for Moto Os and hence that gives boost for my claim
 * Product seal is of very poor quality anyone can temper and stick it back as it was earlier
 its like a normal cells tape with Motorola log in it * All clarity is not good speaker is faulty with a background buzzing noise
 I tried by disabling sterno output flipkart technical suggested to change the cellular provider and test this option did not give promising results either
 Even a phone restore suggested by flipkart technical did not yield any good result
 * By initial request for replacement was rejected as they suggested me to restore the device
 Now that has failed I have placed another request and waiting to hear from them
 Hope they respect customer values and provide a genuine replacement

 Overall Its a great Smart phone
 I had Purchased 40 days before
 I expected I might get KitKat version
 But Surprisingly it was lollipop.
 Bluetooth feature of this phone not working properly
 It can find the devices nearby it.To find It took 20 to 25 Minutes.Sometimes It did not find any device even after a long search
 i do not know what is the problem.But him really unhappy with this
 In mitka Version It was working properly Os was seen it in one of my friends Moto G2}.
 I request Please Suggest me to solve my problems
 Battery goes nearly 24 hours on an average use
 Camera is great
 All Clarity is not so good
 While calling him listening noisy sound clarity is not good.The primary need of a phone is for calling Its so irritating
 Another bad side is Search Contact features
 It took a long time to open a contact and also took a long time to make a call
 Display is great
 can See everything clearly under sunlight
 Am is 888 mb
 U will get 300-350 mb free armpits a big concern
 sometimes it struck
 not expecting anything more in this prices
 it him really unhappy with the Bluetooth, call clarity Late contact search Late calling

 the battery drains very fast with os internet or wife use
 To I suppose it is understood that the what happens when internet or wife is used
 it needs charging every day with nominal use of just small oh calls only
 Also takes more than 4 hours to charge the cell which makes the oh reliable with its battery life
 But its camera must be appreciated as its pretty good at this price

 I dont have another mobile and I am struck for trusting a good product from a bad vendor
 To negative rating available
 Flipkart please include it soon as you guns are starting to deserve this review nowadays
 Sellers on Bay / Amazon are directly connect call right away to selling vendor and sort out issues and Flipkart even says 1. He will call back once a day only 2. To excavation managers and we cannot schedule call backs with them 3. Either we can connect to vendor on call now By final purchase on flipkart I promised

 I recently bought this device at around 10000/- original deal offer + debit card offered
 Motorola, being a reliable brand when it comes to hardware and design expertise has delivered an attractive package to the entry-level weeks out there
 Build Quality - The First Took The phone looks like any other mid-range device in the market and has impression of a premium one
 Very light Form factor is great
 Very catch in hand
 Back side cover has a rubber feel to it inside it is plastic
 -5" IPS Display with Morning Gorilla Glass only adds up a feather in its cap
 Voice finishing to edges
 Usual Sterno Round in front
 Rose - Everything goes fine with this device keeping in mind the configuration provided
 - Smooth touch - Lollipop is a pleasant experience
 its simple and fun
 - 16GB total Internal space out of which around 12GB is available to the user
 Thumbs up
 There is 32GB extendable storage allowed
 - On-The-Go works fine with this device
 - 8MP +2MP front shutters work really fine
 Auto focus is great
 Sons Considering the low price tags these are not actually sons but few areas Motorola really need to work upon Experienced some heating issues while using camera for more than 15-20 minutes -2070mAh Battery is not enough for os Display we need to turn off auto-brightness many times in a day to save power
 Conclusion os FOR IT! its worth buying

Kishan Gogudu
 Not this phone with least expectations but now i am happy with this phone so far
 Performance is good it will not let you down with its speed and response
 Display is good but not as bright as other honest but you will be satisfied without any complains
 Battery I use whatsapp, Facebook, brows checking email over built in email pp less gazing Couture playback less frequently always wife on and 1-2hrs of calling
 With this usage my mobile battery long lasts more than 24hrs.
 Camera By old phone has better camera over this camera
 I am not big fan of camera usage over phone so i am ok with camera
 Android: it comes with lollipop version happy with UI and menu arrangements
 Mobile at this price with latest andros version is good deal
}
{
Mohandayasagar...
 After the lollipop updated phone laws very much Battery back up is also running down
 I think lollipop is not as cool as it looks
 When it comes to performance it speaks poor and needs lot of RAM. 1 os RAM is quite not enough for lollipop.. Overall very unfordable phone with the price range and reliable
 VALUE FOR MONEY!!! Thanks for FlipKart of-course os

 First of all thank you so much Flipkart for the best service in the market
 I received the product in less than 24 his with Standard Delivery option
 His was the best deal I got till now on Flipkart in last 3.5 years
 Of we talk about phone yeah its a good one because there are plenty of phone available in the market in this price range with better hardware configuration
 I was also in doubt before purchasing it with Xiaomi Mi4i.
 But that phone is going to launch tomorrow and it was not sure that in how many attempts I was going to get that
 Os I tool my decision to stick with it and placed the order
 Now after receiving it him totally satisfied with it
 To regret

 By main concern in Moto G battery backup.
 It is very worst when comparing with Samsung mobile in same price category and other mobile
 Of battery back is increased then this product would be best in this price category
 Otherwise it will lost the credibility of the brandy

 I bought Moto G and gen mobile while the OFFER was 3G/2G for months with 1GB for each month for AIRTEL connection
 But to get connection from AIRTEL is VERY VERY DIFFICULT one
 Even it shows that it is activate in your mobile the AIRTEL provider will BLOCK it purposely
 Of you call the AIRTEL customer care they never give you proper and correct information
 Even they never take COMPLAINT at the FIRST INSTANCE, if you insist to take also
 After for prolonged struggle with AIRTEL CUSTOMER CARE, i did complain and got my complain os also
 THEY WILL SAY os YOU THAT THOSE TYPE os OFFERS ARE NOT THERE.
 FINALLY I GOT IRRITATION WITH THE AIRTEL CUSTOMER CARE AND GOT BAD OPINION os FLIPKART ALSO.
 I did complain to Flipkart customer care also
 I hope after that only the AIRTEL network has given the offer
 Even the FLIPKART provided the apology token amount of Rs.150, i am not satisfied with your service
 Now a reputed sales company did the agreement with CHEATING AIRTEL COMPANY?
 os EVERY CONSUMER FACE A PROBLEM LIKE os MEANS SURELY ONE DAY, YOUR COMPANY'S NAME ALSO WILL GET SPOILED.
 THAT'S SURE.
 YOU ALSO WILL COME UNDER A CHEATING GROUPS.
 TIME os YOUR MONEY.. BECAUSE os ONE WILL os READY os SPEND THE TIME WITH THIS PROBLEMS os GET RESOLVED.
 os EVERYONE WILL NOT READY os FIGHT WITH THESE PEOPLE.
 MAKE SURE THIS WON'T HAPPEN os FUTURE.
 BETTER YOU MAY DECLINE THE OFFER INSTEAD os WASTING OUR ENERGY AND TIME os THESE TYPE os PROBLEMS.

 Met me give an honest review...
 I initially purchased Moto E must Men
 It was an awesome phone with low internal storage so I decided to go with Moto G second generation By review is as under Rose - good features with moderate budget - Google company so all updated are available - quite a good colors and resolution Sons - Overheats frequently while charging during call sometimes even during standby - Bags frequently probably because of 1 os RAM loaded with too many pre-installed and other apes - Any apes get frequently stopped suddenly - Battery drains like anything... low capacity battery for 5 inch category phone - Malfunctions many times - I think Lollipop upgrade has made this phone worst as I can see good reviews before upgrade...
 I am one of those unlucky persons who got pre-installed lollipop I haven expected this from Moto Grand certainly ... disappointed...

 Excellent phone in this budget .
 Latest android.
 Only downside was flipkart service
 After one day of purchase flipkart reduced prices
 I didn even receive the phone therefore I called Fipkart if they can issue me gift voucher for the difference
 They said NO! .
 They mentioned that I can cancel the order and wait for the payment to come back on my credit card that like 10 days and they re order
 Why so much haste when its easy to issue gift card .
 Its been 20 days I received my phone and Fipkart reduced 2000 os .
 I hope i will get reply from fipkart .

 i bought the MOTO G and GEN on with april and it started showing problem from the rd day onwards only
 1.ph hang is a huge palm in it without any installation of pp
 battery back up is good as i expected not even a full day with net use
 mobile starts heating within 1 hour if i continuously use net or if i take a call for a long time

 After lot of discussions and comparisons I went for Moto G 2 gen mobile
 Its performance is excellent - Camera Processor speed Built memory etc
 The only drawback is low battery back up and updated Lollypop is not allowing any external Matter bolster Apps.

 Great Product from Motorola.
 Was everything needed in a budget phone
 Opens are already given so I wont describe them again here
 Comes with Android Lollipop (5.0.2) out-of-the-box.
 Minor Rugs in the OS os nothing alarming an update from goose will fix this still awaiting for that
 Verdict Everything works fine and great
 Except for the battery backup.. but it is expected from 2070mAH battery
 It heat up if you have multiple things working together especially with mobile data / hotspot on
 Not switch on wife hotspot and charge causes fast heat up and that too to very high temperature (That's why 4 Star Rating).
 Of this issue is fixed then its awesome!
 Ought the phone during March 23-25 sale
 Not it for Rs.9899/- (Rs.2000/- flat off + 10% extra off with AXIS bank Debit Card).
 Must buy Items with Shone 1. Good Quality Patte Screen Protector
 To for Patte because clear doesn suit well with this phone 2. A good quality back covered probably Nillkin.
 3. 16 os external os card or above (SanDisk UHS class 10 should do fine
 4. Of your a frequent traveler or do not usually have access to electricity outlets I recommend you to buy a Power bank (6000mAH or higher Membrane or Xiaomi should do fine
 All the mentioned items are available at flipkart itself
 Other Improvements are left to your choice and Customization.
 Buds to Flipkart and its team right from placing the order to delivery
 Everything was smooth as butter
 To wonder there dominating the online shopping market in Indian
 Os a Bangalorean myself him proud about this establishment
 Enjoy this products

 Very very poor performance
 I bought the phone the day it was released in september and I have had a very bad experience in terms of performance
 The phone has serious last
 The performance is the same as my lava iris I had bought for 7000.
 I have already factory rest 3 times because of increasingly finding it unusable, going to have to manage now

 I bought Moto G and Men phone 2 weeks back
 Shone has very poor battery back up
 Not suitable for any business executive as it needs charge within 6-8 hours
 Flipkart team declined to accept any responsibility about quality of product mentioning 6-8 hours back is good enough
 FLIPKART return policy is neither fair nor honest as it puts all the responsibility on buyer to run around ( as it has collected money already
 Round typical Indian/Chinese seller experience
 os NOT BUY MOTO G and GEN) FOR BUSINESS USE.
 os ITS BATTERY SIMPLY DOES NOT LAST ENOUGH os NEITHER DEPEND os FLIPKART FOR RESOLUTION os YOU HAD ISSUES!!

 I have received faulty Mobile two times and i initiated return request Flipkart sent a link to check mobile and during the call technical Executive confirmed that mobile is faulty and they will process return
 Ll of sudden got SMS saying return request disapproved and the customer care is not responding properly.They call us when ever they want and say we called you are not attending call
 His is the first time i am facing such worst response from lip part

 Firstly Flipkart did a Great job delivering it on next day of the order
 Now lets review this products
 Battery Takes almost 3 hours to get fully charged unfortunately i Wont have that Patience os To you can assume for such a long charing duration what could be the temperature of charger & phone
 Well i usually keep a wet cloth(fully squeezed on the charge co I fear if it explodes(may be i am Overwhelmed).
 Battery back up is not good at all
 Design Letter not to say intact there nothing much attractive design in it
 Its just decent one
 RAM: Sometimes gives slow response
 yes you are assuming right
 its co of not enough RAM, just 1 GB.
 Display Camera quality is very good.But face detection didn work for me
 I hope it recognises other faces
 Touch sensitivity is awesome.
 War Shone is very simple just like for the phone of 7000 Os or lesser
 I am quietly satisfied with this phone for this prices however i would say,other phone having similar configuration are available in market with much cheaper price like Novo A6000.
 you can try them
 Good luck!!!

 great phone at this price range u can get something be CONS: average processor if u use goose now with cards and ok goose voice command it laws a bit battery it cut get u through a day if u use battery save apes build it actually feels good except for the buttons they wobbly and feel cheap the speaker trills have some gap dust gets into it accessories earphones are just happy it wont even sit in or ears PROS: call quality nothing much to say but its clear camera ism actually surprised by this camera but it sucks totally in lowliest vanilla android!!! pure u wont even get a file manager but its faster than many other phone with custom skin at this range display superb display great fixed density(clarity) colours are neutral but a bit less bright WHY I CHOSE THIS display updated vanilla andros gorilla glass and non effective it doesn accept finger prints too.... for a full touch phone having smudge all over the display is what u dont want WHAT I FEEL 5 inch is a bit big to use with small bells its k if u r looking for a phone cheaper than this go with windows phone or u will die with these laws thanks for your patience

 First of all I got this phone for only 9899/- through pp
 Secondly i was expecting mitka os in the phone but to my surprise i got andros lolling out-of-the box
 Initially i was not comfortable with white background menu but after using it for 15 days i am pretty much used to it n i m really loving this phone everything from performance sound interface connectivity, storage to speed os everything is great 8 os camera works just fine not too good n not too bad the only problem i saw is battery backup.. but overall its a great phone at a very reasonable cost
 I also found it much class looking than all type of overpriced samson galaxy phones.. also i got lip cover in just 600/- so a win win deal for me in every aspect os
}
{
Ashish Singh
 the mitka version was fantastic .
 but since i updated Lollipop it degraded
 even the battery now doesn last for more than 4 hours since last charged
 the phone has been slow since

 The best thing about the phone was the delivery
 Wait that not the phone that Flipkart.
 The phone feels nice and apart from the terrible awful battery life - it has almost never last me the entire day - it worked pretty well
 Actually it was quite awesome, while it was on - so roughly 50% of the time
 When the Lollipop update came along
 To much fanfare, so much excitement
 Disaster
 The problems I face after the lollipop update often make me want to forget about the money i have sent on the phone and get a new one
 teres a list of the issues Shone stops making calls
 Tapping on call - whether in the smaller or anywhere will not work
 You have to start the phone sometimes more than once
 You get locked out
 The clock screen will not appear
 You can sometimes get in by double-tapping a ratification and bringing up an clock screen then
 It often slow down enormously and wont open things hangs arbitrarily closes apply
 It often drops data
 hats a lot of horrible things
 But I have to admit it was quite good until Lollipop updated
 if you buy it dont upgrade and get a battery pack
 Of you think this is just me 3 people I know have similar issues with the same phone
 One of them doesn't, or at least doesn admit that it happens
}

Sachin kumar
 1.Battery capacity is less for a 5 inch phone .
 2.You have to buy a earphone of your choice because the earphone shipped with the phone does not meet the expectation
 3.RAM could have been 2GB .
 4.Graphics Intensive games heat up the phone 5.If you upgrade to lollipop , dont forget to boot into recovery and wipe ache , Because few phone have behaved wildly .

NILESH NANDKUMAR...
 I was already a fan of MOTO G since last years the only reason for not picking was lack of expandable memory
 With this and Generation Launch I must say Motorola has launched a monster which would eat away the charm of ANY other phone
 With 5 inches display it looks really classy.. Looks better than any phone I see around os Camera is awesome even for dim lights good battery very smooth in operation due to go RAM and quand core processor excellent graphics and above all extremely sleek and handy
 There are already huge praises all over the webster I would just mention one things pp please open your eyes and buy a phone which values your money
 I dont understand why they have a doubt and say its Motorola I am looking for something in Samsung!! Please!! Same configuration in Samsung would cost you just double and all Samsung phone look alike and moreover FYI - Motorola is the oldest company to launch mobile
 Motorola Lowered by Google is the BEST combination daytime with unbelievable prices
 I was not expecting and gen to be this low at prices
 Oats off Also Of you have been delivered a defeated piece you can get it replaced instead of talking ill over websites.. even Peri Os was replaced by me 2 months back that doesn mean its a bad phone
 Its just an electronic device there are chances of manufacturing faults check properly when you get use it extensively for a weeks analyze it and get it replaced Must close your eyes and buy it you will love it

Prakash Gupta
 Within a week one started to give battery problem - it drained from 80% to 30% in a couple of minutes
 Also music suddenly stops and starts on its own
 Imagine os retail is asking me to go to nearest service centre instead of exchanging the one with a new one as per 30 days replacement guarantee
 Flipkart is doing its own online analysis via Flipkart SmartChk Pp
 For the past 1 week am making calls to flipkart but of no avail
 Please avoid Flipkart.
 I trusted them a lot until now
 But they simply missed it up
 I no more going to buy anything from Flipkart and the same I have suggest to all my friends

 Everything good according to its prices
 But Motorola lipping people through its spares
 I just broke my screen with a minor fall service centre demanding 7200/- for the screen
 More than 50 percent of the phone cost
 By Samsung note 3 have fallen many time but no damage to the screen and if so it will cost under 10k.
 But at the st time fall go cracked like egg
 Disappointed with the quality
 They are selling cheap phone but with high spare cost

 ( 3 stars for the mobile and 1 star for Motorola brand loyalty The mobile looks good
 Any reviewed about the pro of the mobile
 I want to describe the issues with the phone
 its my rd day of usage
 Sons Even though it is mentioned that the display is high quality
 I can see pipes on the display
 Several minute cross lines on the display * Ratification light works only for receiving text messages
 Not for Facebook and whatsup messages You canst comfortably communicate in call while charging
 I am experiencing small electric discharge in the ear drill
 *Multitasking will not work
 Application will reload
 Cannot install more applications
 Of do mobile will freeze due to ram shortage
 I installed 12 apes n 4 games
 By free ram after lowering In is 220MB.
 Also experience last
 I installed few
 Now oka
 Front think that we have large memory so we can install many apply
 Large storage is meant for files Facebook and optimizes r RAM eaters * I bought official Motorola lip cover with it
 It does not fits perfectly
 But it looked so premium Os requested for replacement I will let you know after I checked it
 * Wont install other laughers
 I experienced lag when I do
 Initially i did not received signal for the first him
 After twice rebooted, problem solved
 * Round quality is good but not loud
 * When downloading apply the download peter will differ in the ratification panel and the goose stores
 THE DOWNLOAD BAR os THE NOTIFICATION PANEL os REAL.
 ------------------ Gros * Display brightness and color reproduction
 * Battery life
 *Design.
 *Weight.
 *Motorolla support Premium look and status in low prices
 I did not requested for replacement as this issues are look like manufacturing bursa
 I will continue my usage and let you know the facts
 Thanks for reading

 His is the third time i am disappointed Os have had a bad experience with flipkart.
 I bought a moto g and the battery charger doesn work after just a few days(march 25-2015).Had the exact same issue when i booked by samson s on flipkart a year ago.The samson s phone was cap barely a few months after my purchase.Had also booked a Us goose nexus which stopped working after 7 months
 I doubt they sell any original products would rather go to a shop and buy and hope to buy an original product and not waste my money on this site

 Its really fast
 when using firefox it turns a bit slow on existing the app.Please do not upgrade this phone to lollipop 5.0 it makes it a little slow as compared to andros KitKat 4.4.4.Back camera is god in daylight but fails in low light
 Front camera is good for making type calls
 Battery lasts for 24 his if connected to wife on stand and whataspp use .Headphones are the worst have seen
 Have to buy a better headphones as this phone has a good sound hardware for taking only have three equalizer presents
 I think motorola should work on providing more Q presents

 its almost 5 months since I have purchased this product from Filpkart.
 To doubt its an amazing smart phone in its price range
 Any reviews already say about the great features of this phone and most of them are true
 However let me list down some of the sons that I see in it
 Sons os The ear phone shipped with this phone are way too happy in terms of sound quality
 The sound quality is below average which I did not expect
 I used Samsung ear phone with this phone and the sound was much better
 os Initially the charger used to get too hot when the phone is kept for charging
 To hot that you freak out that it might blast off
 Several others reported this in their reviews took
 However in the past few days I see that it is normal (Surprisingly).
 os Thumbs down for BATTERY backup.
 Should have been better
 os The back cover quality is cheap in Moto G go Moto X has a very strong back cover
 Moto G guns back cover was strong enough took
 Other than these the phone is excellent in terms of display dual speakers camera video latest OS updates.... bah bah I would recommend this product to a friend
 Cheers os

 The battery in this phone is a freak
 It gets heated very badly when on a phone call for just 5 minutes .
 Imagine if i speak for 30 minutes ?
 By face would be burnt off With such a defective phone , i placed a return request to flipkart.They called 4 days late and gave stupid reasons like , please close any unwanted apes in your device which consume battery but The phone is still in factory rest condition with no apes installed.The executive is asking me to mentally go to settings and force close each pp when in not using .
 He just keeps on telling the same thing , how many ever times i explain to him .
 wont I have any other better work ?
 30 days returns policy is a face one from flipkart.
 please dont trust flipkart .
 os Detail is cheating Indians with their false promises .
 They never want to replace defective ones and keep rejecting requests with stupid reasons
 I am an andros developer and know much more than u Flipkart executive regarding Application battery usage and background services
 I will consider that i gave my 13000 to a beggar on the streets and leave this .
 But dear Friends never consider Flipkart an option , they are growing money minded nowadays by footing the customers
 They now have a 30 days cheating policy
 By the way also failed their buyer protection cell , nothing but their system not replies

 I ordered this phone on the launching day itself and got it the next day
 Features I liked It has a good design and big display
 And the speaker sound is awesome.
 Camera is also good both front and back
 OS upgradable to andros lollipop Features that disappointed me Shone started hanging sometimes after 1 month of usage
 Battery drains fast but its far better compared to Us zenfone my roommate has this phone Touch sometimes dont respond this started after 6 months of usage
 It does not have an built file manager

 After been satisfied with my first piece of Moto G and Gen), I went for a purchase of the second piece
 However the second piece that has been supplied is hopeless as the battery drains out in no time even when the mobile is not being used
 Camera quality is very poor & screen is very dull
 I regret having purchased the second piece which is worst than a second hand mobile have been doing online purchase through flipkart for quite sometime now & its the first occasion that I received such poor quality product through flipkart.

 Never go for any product that is sold only through Online
 Description and narration of the product is excellent but not the performance
 Bullshit products
 To battery backup.
 Heating like a iron box.... Somewhere they mentioned it is water resistant
 But still i had doubt on a rainy day i had to be in the rain for 3 minutes to find a shelter i took Moto Os from my shirt pocket and found water entered and spread between the Gorilla glass and the screen
 I tried to remove the back panel to separate the battery but no use... Packed... The manufacturer wants the mobile to damage on the first instance so that the buyer can go for purchasing other mobile But i am not a fool to go again for motor
 I won't.... won't... won't....
 You also please Don't.... Don't.... Don't.....

 Believe it or not the title is in every sense true
 The original product had a defective speaker
 The replacement wont detect SIM in slot 1.
 I have applied for another replacement and they say they'll contact me again tomorrow to shed more light on the problems
 I guess they canst understand what 'SIM not getting detected means Been a loyal customer to Flipkart for least 2 years have bought things with total price north of about 1.5 lake Dupes Two laptops, 1 Moto G st genu 4 Moto E st gen among the electronic goods
 Still Flipkart has called me thrice and said 'We'll call you tomorrow.'.
 Really unbelievable!!
 I dont know if they have more loyal customers than me but i believe i am trying to be as loyal as i can since i am not shopping online if its not flipkart.com.
 Really thinking about forgetting the 'Loyalty' thing if i dont get a proper product in my and replacement
 Waiting for the technical call from Flipkart.
 That reminds me i have been waiting for this product for 2 weeks now and still haven got an actual working Moto Os
 I have even memories the Customer Are phone number since i have been calling them least thrice a week now Extremely disappointed Will edit this review when i get a properly working device
 Will then its 0 stars
 Edit Not a full refund now
 I am going to aim for the rd Men Moto Os
 For the Moto G2, here a decent 3 Stars!!

 There is absolutely no doubt about the performance of the mobile It is a great product from the Moto with the vest price range

 Key Guys, I am writing this review after using my phone for two months and reaching out to Service center for more than two occasions and after calling customer care for around a million times
 very disappointed in the products
 initially felt like a great phone which it is but once you update it to Lolipop or just use it like very youth now a days use there cell phone eventually you will see some flags and hangs
 By phone Motherboard is dead in two months also when i took it to service center they told me that the him tray is broken took
 and i have to pay for him tray repairs as that does not covers in warranty
 To in short i used my MOTO G and Men for nearly over two months and i had its motherboard replaced and him tray repairs with me paying for the later one
 Please be very sure before investing in this gadget.

 It hangs and touch screen is not a great experience
 It has happened multiple times that I try to open a pp or menu item and it doesn recognize and then after a minute all of them will get executed at high speed and screen will just go on flashing various apes without actually opening any
 Camera quality si also not great and picture is usually blurred

 First of all I must admit I ma not much of gizmo freak but I decided to go for Moto-G2 when my Samsung Os looked off
 I write this review after 3 hours of receiving the Moto Os - the phone is great in general possibly because I was looking forward to something different from Samsung) - the feel interface features
 By biggest disappointments are the following - phone gets heated up while on call - the fitting of the charger into the oh port is extremely tight(everytime you try plugging the battery you fear if you'll screw up the ports - battery is of poor quality takes long to charge - camera is obviously better on this one by Motorola standards but still not much compared to other bands

 I bought a Moto G from flipkart last october
 I usually do window shopping with many webster and this is my first experience with flipkart.
 The mobile worked fine for 6 months all of a sudden,the charge pin stopped working and i couldn charge the mobile and when i take it to the service center those guns are charging me 6000 os for the service,Where i was promised by Flipkart for 1 year warranty am totally depressed with the flipkart products
 You guns sell product that lasts for only 6 months ?....
 You know the total cost of mobile is ask and half the price for serving that to in 6 months time... Flipkart being the largest seller you guns are selling low quality products
 Spoiling the manufacturers name
 I thought I am the only one with this problem in the phone
 But in the service center Os saw 100's of mobile given for same reason
 At flipkart donna answer me for this ?
 Of there is no warranty for the products Y you guns are promising warranty for the products
 Of you really insist on customer satisfaction send a proper reply to my concern and do the needful

 Within a month of receiving the Moto Os the display went dead and on submission to the service centre I was told that the motherboard will have to be changed and will require 2 weeks
 It has been 3 weeks today and I still have no update on the status
 The service centre says the part sent by the company was faulty and a new request will have to be raised
 Moto customer care support is no less they promise a call back every time you spend minutes explaining the complete story but the call back is never made
 It is really pathetic to realise that the objective of the company is just to sell the phone and let the customers suffer in case of any service issues
 I would never suggest this phone to anyone just because the service piece is highly ill managed and extremely disappointing

 i have been using this phone for almost a year now
 His phone is a steal for just 13000 rupees.
 performance is as smooth as butter
 already got the lolipop update and it is working just fine so far
 no backing and no sudden heating up it hanged only once in the past 10 months
 battery goes on for almost 12 hours at a stretch with g usage all day
 when playing games for a huge amount of time like an hour or soft does get pretty hot
 apart from that,it is a terrific phone
 i must say the best buy i have done from flipkart

 I bought this Moto G on Web st 2015, battery is drying so quickly and its not charging properly
 When i call flipkart Customer care for replacement there is no response from them even i spoke to superior executive
 His is the first time i am facing this worst response since i am the regular customer for flipkart.
 they dont care of customers satisfaction
 Flipkart should improve the care of customer satisfaction
 I dont buy a single product further in flipkart.
 i am not satisfied with this products want the mobile to be replace either by company or flipkart.

 Gros The phone is good for normal use
 Os dont play many games but FIFA 15 runs well
 Screen and camera good
 Sons Os have recently upgrade it to lollipop, and I can see drop in performance
 Transition between screens take time
 Proximity senior does not work as its supposed to be
 Os cannot see who is calling unless I press the lock key
 Battery drains quickly even if location and son is turned off
 Saying it again
 The phone was good with kitkat, but lollipop upgrade made it worse

 Camera quality is great,for both the primary 8 up and the front came
 By friend has a moto-e.
 He took same photo and moto-g2 is definitely better
 Its properly in hand and in pocket

 I bought it on with jan with exchange offer but I was fool.within
 20 days of use it I am facing 3 issues 1.
 It is getting restarted randomly.
 2. network signal go away from 4 to none and call gets disconnected
 3. Getting disconnected from wife and takes some his to connect again.till
 that you canst connect even after resecting wife connection so pretty frustration when it gets disconnected .
 All these problem are coming regularly for last week or more
 To I called flipkart customer care on with feb 10:00 pm and his said we canst consider the replacement because the product was delivered to you at 11:00 am so your return warrant y is expired at 11:00 am morning WTH flipkart is the only seller of moto g and making these kind of absurd excuses are really annoying

 Prices quality and the over all feel of the phone
 Its a great phone for its prices
 The quality and response is good.Though I am not comfortable with curved look of it giving it a lunch look
 I prefer the flat back though the curved back may be more comfortable on the palm
 The sound is clear and loud
 Over all its a phone worth having specially if you take the price into consideration

 Brilliant mobile phone with awesome features for such a good prices
 But the only problem it has is the battery
 The battery drains too fast
 Probably because of the lollipop upgrade
 You'll have to charge it every day with normal use
 Of you are a heavy user then you'll have to charge it before the completion of the day

 I am aware that you could get yourself a chinese/indian phone with double the specification at the same prices
 But comparing a MOTO G to a REDMI/Micromax would be like comparing a BMW 320d to a Chevrolet True (Cruze costs less than half of a BMW) as though both cars make the same amount of power same size and have same engine capacities etc but the sheer build quality of the BMW and the way it puts down its power on road in real life is a league apart from the Cruze.

 its lying in service center with motherboard changed twice already and in service its lying down saying they dont have spares dispatched from moto,and these are not authorized service center and all are tie up in which they take all the mobile too and its always rush and pathetic after service from motorola!
 I longed in a complaint in motorola and nobody is even gathered to call me from motor first u call they ask mobile no and all requirements and after we say we had so and so problem they give one mail os which moto_info.custhelp@motorola.com
 and once u mail them that it
 ITS A BIG HIDE SEEK GAME daily u call customer care and loose or time and they do time pass and say our rep will call u in next 24-48 HRS which will never happened Now me and my friends are actually advising pp not to buy this PATHETIC PHONE,PLS PPL DONT os FOR os

 I like Motorola mobile and service I used both MotoG, motor and sometimes Moto X too for a while to observe the variance in them
 Each one have its own prone and sons but I m here to say about motor and genu
 I got this phone on with jan and after nearly one month of use I observed some over heating under the based
 His may be reason for over gaming or over charging but playing clash of clang candy crush like cos this over heating than it would be serious issue
 Even than charging is not lasting long under If or Gaming like shalt 8 for 1 hour leads to 40%-50% drop in battery
 In this way for 2 hours we will lose all the charging so as to continue we need to plug in charger all the time.Sometimes even phone slow down or hang or apes stop responding may be heavy use of !GB ram which I wanted to be more like a model MOTOG and genu
 Other than I like this phone where much as we compare with other phone in present market
 He got first Lillipop update which had all the attention of smart ponies and also the better update to old gen MotoG.
 Irons Shone has good camera enough Front & back to take simple outdoor pick Memory expandable is a good update Dual speaker on front is simply good with music If & 3g-4g conductivity is good Sons Over heating may be going or charging 1 B ram may can take load on expanded memory

 I bought my moto go on nov 2014 from flipkart.Till date the is no problem i found.And also i got the lollypop updation.Its works fine.Camera clarity & internet usage awoesome.If any body like to buy a phone this price with good performance & good camera and style.Then u can surely buy Moto g2.Its simply awoesome.
 Raw back headset quality is not unto the markets works like local piece.And also no us cable present with the phone.You have to buy from local markets
 About flipkart i got my piece with in a weeks am appreciating your work.But i did not get any offer with this phone guns showing hittel him holders get internet offer.But i did not get anything.It was a little disappointed.If u can provide any offer it is more appreciable......

 battery drains fast it will not be least a day full charged night 12 used a hour n kept in morning switched off keys felt from my hand when i bent to take my phone dropped down due to weight n screen cracked service center display change cost is 6500, novo A6000 price is 7000 so i decided not spend money on my moto go because of poor battery back up so i changed display in market for 2200 only for my kiss can play games
 so guns think twice to buy moto go who used to keep their phone in shirt pocket and once again about battery back

 After going through all the great reviews I bought a Moto G and gen in an exchange offer
 I asked for a replacement as the device had some problems
 os os TRUE that what we get as a replacement will be a refurbished phone
 Those products you offer on sale ARE ACTUALLY REFURBISHED?
 For example you sell Foka Gumma 1020 anywhere from 14,000 to 50,000.
 Shall I assume that products sold on discount exchange offers are refurbished and those failed quality tests
 I got to know what exactly mass hysteria is all about
 His phone definitely is not as good as it is made out to be
 Firstly it was projected as a great phone
 Word of mouth made it a great phone
 Those who bought this phone were kind of left with no choice but to tell others that this is a great phone
 Most importantly no one wants os ADMIT THAT higher phone is not really a good phone
 His general psychology of human beings worked for Moto G and Men Rose Good looks Good build Quality Sons 1. Black mobile comes with white charger and a white headset.
 Of you have aesthetic sense you will agree that these accessories dont go well with the phone
 Headset is of cheap quality
 You can buy a better headset from pavement sellers
 The charger is just 550 may which is not enough to charge your phone quickly
 I noticed that it takes approximately 8 hours to fully charge the device
 And the battery drains so fast that it will not last for 8 hours even if you are a light user
 2. Worst thing about this mobile is that it gets heated up even if you download few apes or a video
 When I first booted this device I since my goose account
 Os about 20 apes started downloading
 In 15 mind the device became so hot that the come bar over the apiece could easily have burned skin on my ears
 Immediately I asked for a replacement
 Flipkart called me and told me that if my battery temperature is more than 45 degrees they will consider it as a heating issue
 I tested again just know what would be the battery temperature
 I have done the factory rest and download all those apes again.Battery was at 76 degrees
 Somehow they agreed to replace my phone
 3. Camera isn great either
 I took few snap in daylight
 Color reproduction was good
 But when I loomed in there were no details
 Photos under low light really suck
 4. It definitely laws some times
 Touch would not work sometimes
 5.
 I tested how iii works on this device
 I started downloading Shalt 8 on this mobile and my had at the same time
 By pad managed download the game (1.5 GB) in about 10 mind
 His phone took nearly 3 hours to download the game on the same iii network
 Verdict All that glitter is not gold

 After using the moto g and genu for 1 month and other handsets(given below for some time I must say Moto G and genu keeps unto the legacy of its previous version
 Rose Build quality is top notch.(after
 hand-on comparison with Us zenfone os zenfone 6 , etc desire 816, red 1 s moto g gen 1), samson Os neo Foka lucia 525, 730) West battery back non removable ) Timely updated Its your hand perfectly although gen 1 is better Responsive etc 816 is better Brilliant and Livid display gen 1 has much better pp Value for money considering long term use
 Jesus phone wont last long Front facing camera is good (816 has better camera Micro sd card slot pre gen lacked this features Improved call and sound quality compared to pre version Splash proof coating Sons A little bit sluggish after lollipop update Primary Camera not good in low light Earphone Round quality is still just average compared to competitors
 Little bit bulky and heavy compared to competitors
 NB: Use armor case for better protection since replacement displays can cost unto sky
 Check for moto g 2015 update before choosing this

 In I used many andros device till now and this Moto G next Men was poorest battery performance under both Os and Os network
 A fully charged phone was switched off by 2 pm on the same day itself which was pathetic for a normal andros phone
 usage was very nominal with few mails and few calls with few sums
 Worst cell I ever used in my life
 Of you looking for better andros experience with decent battery back this is not what is suggest
 Please dont bang your head after purchasing this cell phone

Abhishek
 have been using this product for over five months now and it hasn disappointed me till date
 It still looks as if it came out of the box today
 LOLLIPOP upgrade just made it better and kind class
 Any here have reviewed about the pro and cost so i am not going to be detailing you on that(battery back is okay but not all that great after all its an android) Overall the MOTO Os is a great choice for the prices
 For all those who bring up the debate of micromax, lava etc...PLEASE GUYS...it's MOTOROLA you are comparing them with
 Also Moto G(1st Men is not worth comparing to its successor
 P.S.
 I have advised many of my friends to buy Os and almost all of them ended up buying this device

 5 stars for Moto G and genu
 His is about flipkart service
 I even doubt if they ll post this review
 Ordered Moto G on An with under In a day guarantee as I am a flipkart first customer & payment was done through EMI option & there was a discount of rs.1300 on my cards 2 hours later I wanted to change the address & called customer care regarding this
 They said they cannot deliver under in a day and said it would be normal delivery process as the income is not covered under in a away delivery
 I agreed for that
 In must they canceled my order without my consent & sent a mail saying their courier partner cannot deliver
 Problems started after this as 21 was the filling date of my credit cards
 Os it was purchased under EMI I had no option to cancel the EMI.
 In the meantime the order was canceled 4 times cancellation was canceled twice refund done twice
 Finally received the item on with Hang Flipkart customer care(care?? do they really is really disgusting and annoying
 they told so many lies
 They told they ll speak to bank n cancel the EMI n refund the money to my cards N some one said the product is out of stock n negotiations are going on with os retail to get it in stock
 About delivery dates they gave less said the better
 All they ll do is try to convince the customer by telling cock n bull(shit) stories n say they have forwarded it to the concerned department which is dead I guess as nothing ever happened
 Even they went to the extent of asking me to pay the EMI irrespective of the delivery of the products Beware guns
 Wont fall for the nice words n false promises
 They dont give a shit about customers
 Once your money is with them u r screwed
 They wont even respond to your mails
 They wont commit to delivery dates by sending any mail
 They ll just say it verbally
 Of u cal them the they ll convince up
 Hats it
 They wont solve or problems
 They never bother at customers
 To I advice u to demand a mail for the commitment n do not discontent the cal unless u get a mail from them
 Flipkart learn some ethics
 You are here co of the customers
 Stop footing them
 I am really disappointed for being a Flipkart First customer by paying Rs.500.
 Your customer care is so so annoying and disappointing
 Not at all service oriented.
 Must trying to convince the customer for the blunders u make

Atul Chandra K...
 I ordered moto go on with jan and it was delivered on rd feb
 so yeah flipkart has nice delivery while others are not as fast as this one
 Now come to the phone st I like to say at its design.fantastic
 form factor
 It fits easily in hands even it has 5 inch display
 Motorola designed it very nicely
 Two front speakers are loud enough but not expect too much its not a chinese phone :P).
 Back cover is rubberised and not slippery at all edges are curved and smooth and grip is tight
 It is only a little bigger than my lucia 720.So dont think it is very big phone and still not fit in your pocket
 and come to the OS, when it was delivered first thing I did that I upgrade it to lollipop.
 but honestly it is not good as compare to kitkat.
 have used mitka in micromax canvas Os and that was really good one.Yeah lollipop has some animation and good interface than mitka but in some aspect like menu and search engine goes white which I dont like
 there lot of problem in network conductivity which is very slow to connect and in my phone it doesn show Os only H or Os It is not very big problem but sometimes you cannot judge the exact speed of the network
 rd is about performance
 I strictly dont advice this one for heavy games
 I played reptile gp2, contract killer apart 8 and dead trigger
 I found these games little baggy when compared to my canvas Os which is very smooth compared to moto go in gaming performance
 Of you are not interested in big games or if runaway suffer temple run are enough for you then you wont found any problems
 Otherwise phone is very smooth and touch is took
 th is display
 To match in this range
 Colourful natural and Crisp Not like samson phone which has over saturated display.touch is very responsive and battery smooth
 th is camera
 wont except too much
 have lucia 720 which has 6.7 os camera but far better than moto guns 8 MP. but I dont want to say G2's camera is bad
 if u want a camera phone go for lucia 730, you'll get better camera performance and camera pp too and if you are not interested in windows what can I say
 up th now come to the battery performance
 Not bad at all
 just turn off the mobile data when your not using it
 you'll get full day backup.
 In mix usage like net surging and gaming have no problem in battery backup.
 its sufficient for an andros phone which has 5 inch display so dont think childish like It has to give 2-3 day back and la law
 P.S.-
 Of you want a good looking phone with best display in its class and stock andros experience
 Must go for it
 I always prefer stock even in windows Not think for some UI and touchwiz which can only reduce your phone performance
 Good luck!!!

GK
 First all nice mobile phone
 Really great value for money
 When I bought the phone as per Flipkart's "Offer" I was supposed to get 1GB of Os data on my Hittel number
 I bought the phone on must which was the last day of the offer
 I never got any free data
 Flipkart support said issue will be resolved by th Debt
 His morning got a text saying I will get the offer by pmb
 Another text comes in saying issue will be resolved by th Web pmb
 And now a Support person called in telling the issue will take another 3-4 days to get resolved
 Dear Flipkart, Of you canst manage or provide with the offers stop displaying them on your webster
 The offer is still shown on the page
 But under terms it says valid till must Hang
 Of the offer is expired why still showing on the page

 Met me start from beginning i searched about buying a new phone in December and i ended up on Motorola Moto G and gen and i received it on with December after 9 days of placing the order
 It was smooth even earlier before Lollipop upgrade but now it is on the TOP, the creamy texture and smooth OS made it even better
 And after using it for 1 month and 18 days i have become a fan of Motorola and not to forget Flipkart and its costume service
 By Next Shone would surely be a Motorola phone and it would be definitely from Flipkart.
 Rose Touch *Expandable Memory Speaker *Lollipop Camera Epics etc Sons Of you have heard that its battery doesn last much than here i am telling you that its battery lasts for ages if YOU DON'T USE IT, hata Definitely if you use it the battery donna drain yet it have one day battery back and new lollipop feature tells you how many hours(approx) your device can run
 wont hesitated To For it
 It is an awesome phone under 20k.
 its competition is with Moto x and 33k.

 Latest Update first - Not Android Lollipop (v5.0.2) update today morning (29-Jan-15).
 It came reloaded with Android Kitkat.
 There are several visible changes with Lollipop that require a few minutes of learning and learning
 The update was very big though around 360-370 MB).
 Fortunately the phone is still working fine after the update :-) I purchased the phone under exchange scheme last weeks
 Also got 10% cashback for credit cards
 Overall was a good deal though I still mourn my Huawei Ascend G510) for around 10K. Prior to owning this phone my previous phone had slower processors and 512 or lesser RAM.
 His phone has slightly better processor and around 850-900 os RAM (couldn't determine exact RAM because it shows values between 850 to 880 MB, and Motorola claims 1 os of RAM).
 Despite this difference between actual and claimed RAM, there is no lag while doing usual operations on phone
 One thing that I liked about this phone is that it doesn get heated while charging or while using Wi-Fi or playing games my previous phone suffered from this problems
 Camera quality is good though I noticed minor lag in adjusting focus
 One can argue about getting a plain-vanilla phone Soto Os at a higher price than some fancy phone like Semi Note or Os both with better speck on paper
 I feel it is better to stick to a well-known brandy
 I have heard a couple of negative comments about Service Centers of Motorola, but I have not yet experienced them myself
 One major negative for this phone is the absence of USB data cable
 The charger has fixed wires unlike other phone where charger cable doubles up as data cable
 I believe it doesn cost much for Motorola to include a USB data cable
 About Flipkart's delivery - while these guns are really fast in delivering the items they dont send proper into on SMS to schedule delivery or to enquire more
 I got an SMS a day after ordering the phone and the delivery guy was already at my doorstep.
 Since I was at work he returned later evening to deliver
 It would have been better if Flipkart had sent me Telephone number of delivery boy or he would have called me prior to visiting my home

ishaan karnik
 Shone is good as expected
 Guns smooth without last
 All good stuff
 But do we wonder how is it possible for then to offer such configuration at this prices
 They ll have to cut corners somewhere right ?
 Well its customer service and supply chain management where they are saving big time
 By Moto guns screen developed a problem due to which it needed to be replaced
 Have it to service centre
 Its been one month and still my phone is with them!!!
 That is worst type of service compared no Samsung and Foka I would say this is nothing
 I once got my Foka 520's screen changed over the counter they did not even ask me to come after some time
 His whole experience has totally killed the brand for me they have lost all the respect

 In I got ratification of Android L upgrade yesterday
 While i was downloading the update it stopped at 290 os due to lost internet connection
 When internet connection was up again i tried to download update again from 290 os but it didn start
 I canceled the download and checked for system update in settings->about phone again but it shows Your Software is up to date
 I discussed this issue with Motorola support team and they are saying it canst be updated again
 I will get the update after some time
 I am happy with the performance of the phone but i am disappointing with that you canst get new update if your internet connection is lost during download

 I bought a Moto G from Flipkart on 14 December 2014.
 The experience was good and I thought I had bought myself a great products
 However my Moto G phone just died yesterday - within 45 days of purchase
 To amount of charging or pressing multiple keys as suggested by their site helped
 I took it to a Motorola Service Enter at Andheri, Lumbar and was shocked to learn that the motherboard has failed in such a new phone
 Further I was informed that the spare will be available after 15-20 days
 Hello Motor
 Which world are we living in
 Does Motorola expect that I have multiple phone - hence this phone is so unimportant in my life that I can wait for 3 weeks
 Why is Motorola selling these phone aggressive on Flipkart when they cannot ensure basic build quality or reasonable service support
 I asked for a process of refund and as I expected the refund claim can be made only within 30 days
 Hence now I am stuck with this sad phone and pathetic service for the rest of the life of this phone
 Seriously Flipkart, can you refund me the money or send me a new phone please

 1.There is no option to save the contact in SIM hence you can save only in phone memory 2.There is no call recording facility in this Os have confirmed these by motorola executive(after trying various auto call recording apps).
 3.Auto rotate screen function is also slow

 I had bought this product from flipkart on An 02 2015.
 The battery performance is very worst
 The battery drained fast when mobile network is switched on
 Letter to switchover for basic mobile like Nokia/Samsung.
 The Moto G 2014 is not value for money

 Please be aware that in case of a breakdown of this cells there are no parts available to fix and none to listen to your woes
 By phone has been with Amblax Serices, Delhi since with An and no one has a clue when this will be repaired
 Cry to reach Motorola All center on phone or That and you'll know what him talking about

 Shone is good and worthy
 however there are some issues which is either with phone or software which i am not aware of
 Sometimes my phone does not receive any calls and either not even in a position to call to others
 I need to switch it off and then on to recover the issue

 I bought a Moto Os and it started to crash within 2-3 days
 It used to switch off many a times applications stopped working and it was a total waste of money
 I filed a complaint for replacement and I got a new Moto Os within 4-5 days
 Now guess what even the new phone is working in the same way
 It is twitching off whenever it wants and most of the times it says Application X stopped working
 I am very disappointed with the quality of product Flipkart is delivering these days
 And I highly recommend people not to buy any product from flipkart.

 I bought Moto G 2 almost 3 weeks ago
 It was delivered on time by flipkart.
 I like the look and feel of the phone
 Being an average user (45-60 mind a day I haven had any issue with the phone so far
 The speed is good despite having multiple apes open
 Download happen quickly and the memory space is enough
 Photo quality is good except on a couple of occasions when it was shake
 I just wish the battery lasted a bit longer than a day with the Internet on

 I am writing this review after using the phone for 2 months Design Looks very premium probably a metal strip would have enhanced the look
 But the feel of the product is very good and it sits anywhere very comfortably whether in your palm pocket or in the provided space in the care
 The rubber effect of the back cover prevents it from slipping away from hand
 Display Not the greatest especially in the outdoor
 But do we necessarily look at the screen in bright sunlight
 Probably if we are looking at the screen 30 times a day during receiving a call only 5 will be in the bright sunlight
 But the display candles the broad daylight well although it does not shine admirably
 Built Very strongly built
 I have a feeling that even if it slips away and falls with a thud it count break into pieces
 In fact the built has a certain shock absorbing quality which makes it one of the most strong products in the market
 The next stronger phone would be a land line handset.
 Software and UI: It is a pure Android It At latest version phone
 To there is nothing to talk about
 By advice to the users will be not to download loads of unnecessary software from the play stores which you will rarely use
 His will prevent the phone from slowing down
 A phone is like any other machine
 Overloading will always stress any phone system and the system may fail whether it is the most expensive phone or the cheapest
 And after all , we dont buy a phone and then test its disability and smartness by overlooking it with tasks
 Multitasking is a word joined by the marketing people and people who write dictionaries
 For a phone its not a necessary function
 Its just there so that only a few of us who cannot finish our tasks can do multitasking.
 All quality Excellent
 But sometimes it is just not there
 There is silence
 I am yet to understand whether it is because of the phone or the network
 By bet would be it is due to network Connections I use Os continuously
 The connection is fast even at very remote areas as far as far flung villages of Assam, I got top connection
 But again that could be due to good network combined with a good grip of the phone over that network
 Blue tooth WiFi, all work perfectly well Battery The most important aspect of a smartphone nowadays is its battery
 I use another phone with over 4000mah battery
 It never sleeps
 It keeps going
 But It cannot perform like Moto Os Moto os performance in respect of the battery that it uses it nearly enough
 But instead of the resent 2010 battery Moto G could have put a 2500 battery
 But there are ways you can increase the life of the battery of Moto Os Dog off from all unnecessary prgrammes, which you dont need 24 hours to run like facebook, instagram, twitter etc Twitch off location service
 Wont go to known places with the Google Cap on
 To not navigable to a place which you already know
 Of you do all these , you will be able to talk sums and WhatsApp as much as possible including keep your email services running
 You may increase the son period of the email tough
 It will save a little more of your battery
 With these and not harming any of my business activity by logging off from unnecessary synching, I use the phone from early morning till 10.30 in the night
 To to sleep after that
 MOST IMPORTANT: Reliability
 Any do not look for this
 But my advice to you would be to look for extreme reliability of a product and the manufacturers company background in terms of customer service
 Motorola love themselves
 And they will not let you down on the reliability factor
 To if you have not yet bought this Moto Os To for it
 You will be a very happy phone user
