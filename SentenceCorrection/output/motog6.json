 I have bought this mobile before a months
 But found my battery drained up fast and also takes lot of time to get full charged
 Also mobile gets heated up while playing games or watching a movie more than 30 mind
 Of you are an andros phone lover with previous experience you will hate this phone
 Of you are new to andros mobile then go for it
 Also camera picture quality is not up to the mark
 Front cam is okay when compared to rear Cam though it got more meg pixels.

 it has been 5 months that I bought the Moto G ( and Gen)..while the features are good the quality of the product is poor
 The display had stopped working and I had to run to the service centre
 The apathy at Service centre is it will take 3-5 days to repair the same
 The product is and Men but the service is 2 decades behind

 First of all Flipkart rocked this time too in their delivery speedness.....
 I got delivery in only 16 hrs...which was like unbelievable for me.....
 About Moto G2: Rose os Very speed set and never hangs or stuck for even 1 sect os Camera clarity and fixed is superb cool...slomo is really nice....but if sound is available it would be better.... os Touch is very good and smooth enough to use... Sons os The only sons in this phone is that we cannot peg internet connection to Os only mode
 It drags us to Os automatically if the network is not strong in the location
 Very rare to get Os in it...Dont worry users if you want to use Os only data in this set follow this below procedure as I did and it worked for me....thats y i have rate 5 stars for this mobile and to Flipkart as well...... Now to force Os only mode 1)Go to your Phone/Dialer pp and dial the following USSD code *#*#4636#*#* 2)A pour window will open something 3)Select the first option from the list that appears idea
 Shone Information 4)Scroll down till you get to the Met preferred network type heading
 By default it might be on GSM only (i.e.
 Os only or WCDMA preferred (i.e.
 Os preferred
 Change this option to WCDMA only and your phone will automatically switch to Os only mode
 os Unless you understand what you are doing dont weak any other option in this menu as it can lead to problems
 Of you are having a dual him phone you can go to Tireless and Network os More os Mobile Network os Os service and select which him you want to activate Os on

 After usage of 6 months i am observing that battery is draining quite frequently
 Bones buttons and touch is not as good as it was previously
 Some heating issue is also there if i use torch for 5 mind or wife for long time
 Overall i am satisfied from user point of view but some features like multi window features is missing in phone
 Camera quality is not good as it is in Foka lucia (>10 k ranges Its taking long time to charge full (approx 6 hours which is not good at all
 Good thing about phone is you will get andros updated automatically .

 I have a poor and irresponsible customer service and ordering by Flipkart.
 I have placed an exchange offer for Moto G and Men on wednesday with May with expected delivery date of st June Monday and I was not in town during week end.The delivery person called me on Friday with May and informed me that product arrived and I informed i was out of town and asked them to deliver on Monday st June,he too agreed
 Monday I got email order canceled since delivery failed on saturday and sunday.Even sunday i called delivery personnel he told they are not doing delivery on sunday and will deliver on Monday
 1. Their webster and delivery personnel are not in since
 2. Intention is to not providing good customer service

 -Firstly,I am so glad and convinced by flipkart delivery.The delivery got misrouted one day before mentioned delivery date somehow it still the logistics person came at evening 8:15pm just to deliver my phone on the same day before given delivery date got my order only in days of time.Secondly,i would like to thank os Detail for giving me the perfect product.Well i can even say that i am quite lucky to receive the perfect one because some people have reviewed that they got old product or something like that.So,be lucky enough to get a brand new and perfect production that case os Detail is the most trusted sellers of all,dont go for any other retainers if you want to buy electronic goods
 -Well,talking about phone,it is exceptional in this price range,what else do u expect??Its working superb well installed battery saving tools such as os Battery saver,Battery doctor as well which is helping me to have more battery life and providing me more backup.
 Camera is really awesome,front and back cam gives awesome quality pick and flash makes it even better when u have low light around bought this phone only because it has great camera.Micromax and all give camp it they aunt even having quality of 3.2 mp.... James are playing quite well am not fond of playing very high end games.Bt shalt jelly blast,candy crush,temple run 2,subway suffer and all are playing quite well on this
 -1080p video are also playing without any lag on this phone,internet is fast and wife working perfectly
 -OTG helps a lot to watch your favourite moves by connecting your pen drive directly to your phone via OTG cable
 One con i found is that u canst play music and play shalt 8 together,your phone will hang.But its fine because the game needs lot of memory to play and as we have only go of rams according to that its fine... Os would like to suggest everyone to buy this phone because it has great design,feels so good to hold in your hands,quite well battery backup,superb camera,games are playing perfectly,camera is great,and last but not the least will have andros version updated regularly on this phone in future
 Os just wish that it works well in future and if some problems arise then service centre people helps properly

 Please stay away from this phone as it has the worst UI experience when compared to other andros honest
 I tried to return the item through Flipkart and they have played games and did not accept my return stating that it is a feature of Motorola and they cannot do anything
 There are a lot of salient features missing in the phone like customization by SIM, viewing the phone list is not easy clearing the log clears everything and you have to go go into 2 step process and sometimes 3 step process
 By final advice is to stay away from this phone as much as possible and Flipkart is trying to clear its stock as fast as possible

 Very good phone for daily use
 You'll get pro from speck given

 I traded in my sonya peri c for this got it at a price of sky
 The look of this phone is pretty decent but what under the hood sets this phone apart from the other phone retailing at sub 10k.
 The screen is crisp the camera is amazing for this price range performance-wise it is pretty dark fast at launching apes and graphics and ram intensive games run without any last
 The quality of materials used is excellent and the feel is pretty premium
 Would definitely suggest potential buyers to go for it

 os NOT CLAIM YOU DELIVER WHEN YOU CANT!!!
 While purchasing the products I entered PINCODE for which portal reflected saying delivery is available for the given Pincode.
 But actually product came to my district place which doesn fall in the Income I given which is around 40 Ms away from my place
 When delivery guy calls and says you come and pick the product else leave it
 I anna know whose mistake is this
 The worst part in all of this is it was a surprised birthday gift for my dad who lives in my native place and I live in Bangalore.
 To what should i say to dad that Please go and collect the surprised gift which I have sent to you by travelling 80 Ms two way Ridiculous
 os Some thing should be dealt with sensitivity
 You must understand that Flipkart!!.
 I would not have placed that if you guns haven shown me that delivery is available
 Front ask the Income for purification to check whether you have delivery service or not when you really dont bother
 Top of all this there were 4 to 5 excavations for this product to resolve and nothing happened
 And I was kept on hold for almost 45 minutes in the process of transferring call to senior officials
 It all ended up asking my cousin to pick up the product and asked him present my dad
 os Not even a courtesy call after the delivery

 I friends I am writing this review after using phone for 10 days
 I found that Moto go perform really well
 His is my first Smartphone, so feel proud to I have Moto go which looks really cool and fantastic.As of now i didst get any issue
 Some Important point Camera quality is very good as compare to other phone like Yu-Yureka & other
 Performance is to good as of now I download all required apes and didn any issue like heating hanging
 Shone is performing really well
 To heating issue like Mi4i, Yureka.
 Battery back is also good
 Of you used normal then its for 12-16 hours
 Of you continuously Os or gaming its drains quickly its for 6 hours normally
 Only I found that its take lot time to charged full around 3-4 hours
 Overall it is a very good phone
 Os To for it friends because Moto Os is trust-able smartphone.
 Not having that much issue

 Probably the best phone in its generation for its prices
 Offers you countless features and the Morning Gorilla Glass is silk smooth with the brightest and smartest appearance
 A great point to be noted is that as soon as you get your phone and switch it on its donna ask you for the Android upgrade to Lollipop(make sure you have your Wi-Fi on and it updated within seconds
 Provides you an exceptional battery back-up and a sleek rear cover
 Also the screen is massive bigger than the st Men model
 To folks just go for it

Anand Madhavam...
 Thanks to Flipkart for delivering this great phone within 2 days of online purchase
 I would like to express my views after a months use Rose 1.
 The design - Sleek elegant never felt bulky in spite of the near 11 mm thickness and the 150 grass
 In my opinion the black color suited the design well
 2. Screen lock button - Now profile and firm - helped prevent accidental dealing
 3. Ratification light aptly designed and helpful
 4. Display - His is where it scores the max
 Livid with good color depth and crisp lines
 5. Graphics - Smooth and lag free
 Fluid transition between venus and windows
 6.
 All clarity - Loud and clear without cracking or buzzing on both the earphones and the speaker as well
 7. OS - His phone came with Android 5.0.2, which was delightful devoid of unnecessary apply
 The interface was a refreshing changes and the performance was good
 8. Battery life - Well it lasted a maximum of about 40 hours with calling messaging, surging and online apply on 3G, hence quite decent
 9. Camera - The clarity of the primary camera is really good for 8 MP.
 West when shot in natural light
 10.
 It did get warm while charging no overhearing thought
 Sons 1.
 To data cable provided with the phone
 2. The lack of a file manger
 I had to get one from the PlayStore, which obviously came at the cost of as 3.
 To useful PC/Mac interface
 The Motorola Device Manager merely checks for updated to the phone software
 Overall I would say that the Moto G and offered great value for money in comparison with other phone in its class

 Moto G is all good unless u get in touch with their customer service center or online support staff to share the experience i bought the phone October 2014).
 It got a andros update to lollipop but since then mobile data stopped working
 To i contracted the Support staff ( online and Service center 1. Service center makes me visit every week but every time tell me by next week we will provide u d software to resolve or issue
 2. Over time i call the online support they make me dictate the issue and then tell contact service center
 3. He i tell them that service center can help they tell me to wait for 24- 48 hours
 4 but after waiting i get a mail stating that since we haven heard from u so we consider the issue resolved
 5 then i have to make the call again , and have to make fun of my self by repeating the issue and i get the same response
 ITS A TRAP [Incident: 150524-000931], [Incident: 150211-002831], [Incident: 150209-015846] [Incident: 150211-002831] [Incident: 150226-030405]

 everything is perfect except the battery
 you must have to do some adjustments in the phone for the better battery life like low brightness install all the factory installed stupid useless apes that may run in background installing to many messengers which runs background all the time playing he games etc.to get a full day
 that all
 this phone is excellent in every way
 using it since 5 months

 but still my best vote for this mobile look wise and performance its best deal from MOTOROLA.
 but they should think for battery mAh.
 they should upgrade to 2300 mAh.

 Informed to Customer care guns more than times and every time they are saying Your Technical people will contact you with in 24 hours
 But i didst got any call or help from their side

 I placed my order on with March and made all the payment via credit cards
 Despite this my product was delivered very late compared to the products in which I keep cash on delivery option .
 The customer care too was very irresponsible and used to give me lame excuse all the time I called to them
 The more the flipkart grows in user number the more it takes the customers lightly
 The product is good and works fine
 Battery back is also good .
 The touch is also very smooth .
 Response of apes is also good
 I am happy with the products
 I recommend buying it if you are asking for a good phone around ask price range .

 Good display
 Letter than average camera
 But lag sometimes when you load with multiple application
 Not at all for gazing
 Must for basic use
 Vice speaker quality
 I would recommend not to buy rather wait for its next version
 I expect then upgrade the processor in next version for smooth experience

 I am writing this review after using this product for 3 months
 I am not a big adduct of games and all I had installed only one game and few other Apps.
 Now my phone works very very slow it hangs most of the time even when i try to make a call its taking least 5 seas to just open my contacts..it will tell you how slow it is very very poor
 Also it gets heated quickly during browsing and playing games
 His is also not a good sign
 Now there are lot of option to buy high confirm phone comparing to this with same budget

 I bought Moto G for my brother and a friend
 The device has a very clean design and the display is good took
 The negative is the hardware punch the phone laws and hangs with day today use
 I would recommend xiaomi red mi os which has better speck at lower price and it doesn hangs in day to day use
 To concluding : Moto G is good but there are tons of new option out there which are value for money this one is lagging here

 I purchased Moto G and Generation on 24-3-15, from then onwards i am facing Issues with Mobile Heating Network conductivity for 1 SIM Hard Media & King Volume reduces automatically Both SIM cards will get x mark & many more problems
 For this Flipkart checked the mobile by installing Smart Check but nothing improved
 The whole process took nearly 2 months but as per the return policy product will be returned with in 1 month only
 But as the complaint is registered with in 1 month & the product delivered is defective Flipkart promised to replace it if is defective & asked me to visit a customer care center
 Customer care center has confirmed that the product delivered was defective & Flipkart on the discussion initially rejected but after talking to their supervisor replaced the product & delivered in 2 days only
 Thanks for the Beams

 I bought MOTO G and generation mobile last week and with in couple of hours I found there was a problem in speaker and i have requested for returning the mobile
 Customer care pp called and try to convince me several times even when speaker was not working
 when I called final time they are telling some excuse and to update the software to check dust could have struck at speaker
 Now could dust will struck for new mobile
 With my experience please ever buy any electronics from this site

Rinu Thomas
 Had high expectations after reading the review
 After two months of usage this is my feedback
 I work in the TELECOM field and use the phone for basic activities like Voice calls Whatsapp etc
 I dont use gaming or download too many other applications
 The phone is very sluggish to move from one menu to another
 Any times my contact complaint that they can reach me while calling
 I observed during such times I can make outdoing calls either .
 The phone gets into some kind of Hung states
 Solution : Start phone or Light mode os / OFF Last 2-3 days new problem is I can answer oncoming calls
 The phone doesn respond when I touch the Answer button
 The screen sensitivity is ok as I tested other apes in the same area of screen it works
 Solution : I can lock the screen and clock this time I can answer .
 Thinking of what next to do !!!!!

Arpit Awasthi
 Well I purchased the phone because of its reputation and my trust on flipkart.
 I had already bought a nexus 7 and a nexus 5 from flipkart those products were great no complains at all
 BUT this one was a completely different story
 His phone was delivered to me in the st week of April I dont exactly remember the date but the problem was sound from its bottom speaker distorted at full volumes
 so no issues i requested for replacement
 i had to be on phone with flipkart support for 46 mind just for them to check the phone when all that purification and testing was done they told me By new device will be shipped only when this will be picked up and will reach them
 I had no other option to wait
 then I received the replacement model on word April and guess what it had the exactly same problems
 But this time I did not have the patience to be on the phone with flipkart customer support and explaining the same thing to the same guy over and over again
 To i kept the phone did not do anything and i am using it its working absolutely fine but the sound distortion problem still persists
 Plus have reduced shopping from flipkart because last 10-12 orders have placed from flipkart either they were defective or not sanctioning at all
 I bought clothes 2 out of 4 t shirts faded in the st wash
 I ordered a tireless mouse the package was torn all the way when i received it and the worst part it did not even turn on i requested a refund that took 16 day
 I sincerely request flipkart to improve the quality if they really want to retain their customers
 I am certainly not happy and so are not many other loyal buyers

 I am very satisfied and happy on purchasing my new Moto Os mobile handset.
 I have gone through the hands and I did not faced any kind of issues whatsoever for which I was very afraid-of basin upon town talks
 Software is brilliant and gives an out of this world experience
 Lollipop Android on this hands is like Facing on the cake
 All the rest features are also very good and quite amazing
 However one upsetting thing about this phone is that it does not have a USB Data cable-cum-Charger which makes user to arrange it from somewhere else also Headset is kind of OK.
 But nevertheless experience is awesome!

 I used more Couple of andros devices and old Moto G as well till now and this Moto G next Men was poorest battery performance under both Os and Os network
 Battery is getting Discharged 5-6 hours after full charge which is very pathetic ... usage was very nominal with few mails and few calls with few sums
 To multimedia/Games play at all
 Of you looking for better andros experience with decent battery back this is not what is suggest
 otherwise Shone is awesome....no doubts...

 Motorola may be one of the bands that has seen better days in the past
 With bands like Sonya HTC and Samsung grafting the andros limelight, and the giant killer from One Plus One Motorola may have a hard time tying to find a clientele.
 You have to get a feel of it to see how well built this unit is
 It surely gives the midrange units from HTC, Bony and Samsung something to think about
 Its well built and its operation is really smooth for B of RAM.
 I had recently purchased it for a friend who wanted to upgrade from the Samsung Note N7000.
 He was shocked when he found out how well the unit performed
 although he was skeptically at first
 By advice is you gutta try it to believe it

 I purchased this one from Flipkart and have been using this mobile for past 1 month and the performance is excellent
 1. DISPLAY- It is crisp and colors are punch
 2. BATTERY- It lasts for a full working day with screen on time of os his approve on WI-FI along with moderate gaming , web surging
 3. CAMERA- Both primary and secondary are decent but not excellent but considering the price its oka 4. CHARGING- It takes around os his from 0-100% with supplied charge 5. OS- Latest Android LOLLIPOP at its best and simply lawless performance .
 6. GAMING- It could many of the games including Shalt os Head Trigger Clash Of Plan etc without any issues at medium graphics .
 7. AUDIO OUTPUT- Both the front facing speakers are adequately loud and call quality is good
 8. HEATING- It gets slightly warm on extensive gazing which is common with all mobile
 OVERALL os EXCELLENT MOBILE os THIS PRICE POINT AND JUST os FOR os

 It first I was addicted with the phone and after using this phone for few months here are my views
 The specification of the phone is good however I can find few dispatches from my expectations
 - The Last Screen feature also available explicitly in the pull down drawer doesn work with miracast or Smart TV.
 You cannot mirror you mobile screen with os (wirelessly) even when it is supported by Lolipop as it seems to be disabled by Motorola at OS level based on my Goggling).
 - The declared Gorilla glass is not of great quality and I have got few scratches on the screen
 I recommend taking good care of the screen
 Of you could not handle screen carefully then buy a good Lip Over
 - For some of the Days the Shone hangs a lot and couldn let you brows through your pp
 Not sure of the pattern and reason but happens once every two-three days
 It is very irritating and not expected from the phone of this specification
 West all is good and not a completely bad choice for buying

 this one was my first andrew phone - I am completely disappointed with this phone comparable to my friends phone very poor battery bacup, heating issue it reaches up to 50 degree centigrate while long phone calls and while doing multitasking ) - except its look and gorilla glass features there in nothing good to say about this phone - Anyway thanks to flipcart for returning my money after age of 40 days

 Great phone for the prices
 Using it for a couple of months and had no issues till date
 The only problem is while calling on Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp, a slight echo is created due to the location of the microphone(near the top speaker use headset for while calling on anything other than the phone pp
 Other than that everything is good
 It would have been better if the battery was removable just in case the phone stopped responding for some reason

Manan Vora
 Thought the product reached on its schedule time it did not tempt me to use as swiftly as much as I was waiting for it
 I was amazed to know that Moto Os does not have file manager on a first place
 thought you might download Further the contact that were since with email account could not be delete on a one go
 Meaning thereby perhaps there is no option of select all or for that matter select multiple Next I was astonished on noticing that one cannot assign a song from the playlist as a ringtone.
 You are forced to use default ringtones.
 In my further discovery I came across text messages where you are definitely allowed to type but there exists no provision to save its as draft The absence of "memo" and alike makes it so obvious for the need of draft messages
 All what I feel is the phone is surely a smart phone without incorporating some basic much needed features

Himansh Mulchandani
 It has been around 3 months using this device
 Its a really good phone for the prices
 Though you can get better phone from chinese and indian manufacturers at half of this prices this is still the best as it has the best ecosystem of all the accessories and ROMS and other than that it has the best user interface STOCK ANDROID.
 To other manufacturer can match this quality at this prices
 Must a little bit disappointed because of the screen quality when compare to moto g(2013) and also the unknown heating issues when using the camera
 And i also feel that motorola has compromised a bit on the quality to cut down the cost
 I hope they fix these issues with the rd gen moto go
 I dont want a full he screen neither an oct core processor i want the same old quality and reliability for which motorola has been known for
 Overall just dont look into chinese products buy motorola, and upgrade or phone every 2 years

 good service of flipcart , moto g 2 nd gen - features is good , i can say without minimum 6 month exit features is good , because i burned my hands with novo with in warranty period I have purchased a LENOVO mobile model S660 ( IMEI / os os -863336021322270 ) on flipcart.com
 on 10.5.2014 for 12899.00
 video their Voice To BLR WFLD 20140500258299 of same date and delivered at address of my office .
 Mobile manufactured by Novo , party not 2 and they said Fourtech computers , ---- party no os , is authorized service in pure .
 After 10 months of date of purchase I found discard not detected in mobile on 04/04/2015 .
 When I deposited mobile in a Fourtech computers four times to solve the same problem on 04/04/2015 , 07/04/2015 , 23/04/2015 and 24 / 04/2015 but they could not repair it permanently
 I have attached service record of each time
 That time mobile was in warranty period .
 Now just warranty period was expired on 10.05.2015 & if that problem comes again they will take money from me
 Now I dont believe on novo company

 But RAM is 1 os only which should be 2GB He have other choice like Novo A6000 which gives you 2 os RAM and 16 os Built memory

 I have been using this phone for few months now and it has not disappointed
 Its UI is great and camera is superb
 Applications runs at ease and 1 os RAM is just sufficient for day to day pp use
 I have loaded my cell lots off apes and still i have 400 os of RAM space free
 All in all its a great phone at its prices
 Initially i faced issues with the battery it used to not calculate remaining battery usage properly
 Now this issue is resolved i believe after dating the OS.
 I also faced some issues with the speakers at times while calling or receiving a call the speakers they wont work
 When i have to start the mobile and then it starts working

 First unit that I got was suffering from no sound output weak network reception
 Flipkart replaced it with a new one which is still suffering from various problems
 Suddenly stops directing the simcard, battery indicator shows 100 percent for a few hours until it suddenly goes dead shutting down the phone
 Huts the phone onto g network even if the g network is available and selected
 weak iii and cellular network reception are just a few problems out of several
 The best thing that I liked about the cell phone is the two camera which when put into HDR render amazing results
 One words disappointed

 From the day one I faced the problem of battery indication showing zero sometimes eventhough its full charge
 There was no problem in the usage
 But from the last 15 days its continuously getting heated up and discharging in 3-4 his
 Showed in service centre but all in vain
 Its still in warranty and no one is taking the responsibility for replacement neither the flipkart nor the service centre people
 Its really disgusting

 I was little skeptically about buying a motorola phone as my first phone bought in 2005 was incidentally motorola.
 The phone was defective and was having network problems.But having bought first moto e and now moto go I am very much happy with its performance
 The display is awesome the sound quality and camera are too good.But I have some issues with the battery
 The battery does not last even 15-18 hrs.I dont expect a smartphone battery to last more than 24 his like the old nikita phones.But still when you are buying a 13000 rubles phone,the battery could have been little bit better
 Hope that when moto go is released,the battery life issue is addressed

 i replaced this phone from flipkart within 10 days of delivery and later after 4 months that replaced Moto G 2 got its Motherboard crashed
 Motorola service center dont give a damn to what problem their customer is facing I lost my precious data once
 and later when they changed the mother board it got crashed again and my phone is still in Motorola service center till date as Motorola service centers are always running short of components
 I would like to say loud nd clear... Worst thirty phone ever and even more thirty services from Motorola and Flipkart I wish there could be an option of giving negative rating

 The which I purchased for 9899/- is getting charged for 6 to 7 hours and the back is up to 9 hours
 Part from that I observed hanging when using apply which I didn expected from Motorola...
 I thought that getting in discount routes users to get a device with refurbished semiconductors assembled...
 Because the power consumption of processors to high compared to a Qualcomm snapdragon processor in another phone....
 I requested for returning my device for replacement with new one... Need to see for good service from retailer...

 I ordered this Moto Os for the second time
 His was bought one month after I purchased my first Moto G2.
 His second phone that I have received is defective
 Of I compare both the honest the recent one has many problems
 os The screen seems to be yellowish in color as compared to my previous Moto G2. os There are many option in my first Moto Os which are missing in the new one
 os By recently purchased Moto Os gets hanged often when I get a call and I am unable to answer it
 Please note I have not installed any apes in the phone so far
 To there is no possibility of it getting hanged due to the phone being loaded with apply
 By plight does not end here
 I requested for a replacement of this phone and it is past 3 weeks but no action has been taken on it
 I have not got an SMS from flipkart stating that my replacement has been rejected by the seller -"We're sorry
 He are unable to process your replacement request
 Reason : The issue has been resolved between you and the seller
 Hence there will be no replacement or refund
 I WOULD AGAIN LIKE os HIGHLIGHT THAT I HAVE ORDERED THE REPLACEMENT os MOTO Os WITHIN 2 WEEKS os PURCHASE.
 I have been given a defective piece and now FLIPKART and os RETAIL refuse to replace it
 PLEASE os NOT TRUST THIS SELLER.
 THEY ARE SELLING DFECTIVE PRODUCTS AND THEN REFUSE os REPLACE os EVEN THOUGH THE PRODUCT os WITHIN THE LIMITS os RETURN POLICY.
 os THIS os NOT REPLACED, I WILL MOVE os THE CONSUMER COURT AGAINST FLIPKART AND os RETAIL.

 One more things

 Occurs quite frequently
 Camera quality is very poor compared to any other phone available for above 10K.
 Nothing in the phone that i can suggest to others to buy
 Made a mistake by believing on bands Moto and Flipkart.
 Us do read reviews before taking a call to buy this worthless phone

 I had my reservations about buying a phone that has just one go of ram but Moto G but my fears to rest
 His phone just never last
 Not while playing games or while slipping between multiple applications
 Both the front and rear camera are good with solid low light imagine
 The phone is a had heavy but it adds to its charm
 It feels sturdy to hold and needless to say the gorilla glass requires no screen cover
 Shone itself is a thing of beauty
 Up till now I have no regrets
 Degraded to 5.0 the moment I started it have WiFi,so).
 Buy it
 You wont regret it even once

 Though It has some improvements in hardware speck and yes bigger screen feels better the phone has some bags since I have opened the package
 os Message Box always gives a false heading recipient name TD-Sulekha..TD-Sulekha even if the message has been sent by Vodafone.. very frustating os Sometimes it hangs while picking up the call os Seems to have some battery issues as well It last I can only say that reduction in Os price is highly corrected with quality of the handset.

 I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this products
 All I was worried about was what if I got a defective product like the reviews on the site described
 teres the things
 People who get a proper working product not necessarily review , they just ignore and move on
 However people who might have received a defective product would probably share their experience because it is not satisfactory
 Hence , this gives an image of the product that may be it is buggy and has lot of issues
 I bought this phone was worried it could be buggy since it came with Lollipop reloaded , but want .
 Its just great !
 Of anyone is thinking of buying one and are reading this review
 Please go ahead and purchase one without any worries

 He are getting excellent sales support from Flipkart for Moto and other Products
 I had a problem in display in my 4 Months Old MOTO G2.
 Given at an Authorized Service Enter It Chennai.
 Even after a Week there is no firm delivery Commitment
 Reason for Delay was told as Waiting for Spares".
 I feel very bad that spare is not readily available with authorized service agents even at Retro like Chennai.
 Since MOTO Bones are sold Exclusively in Flipkart...Flipkart should play role in service also

 I All
 Moto G and Men is a good phone with its specification but I canst say its an awesome phone
 Purchased it from Flipkart and got the phone at price of Dupes 8,999.00 but had an issue with and him sloth
 had to return and got a new one
 The phone has major issue with its heating problem and battery
 Seat - It heat up after 15-20 minutes of internet use or game
 Battery - battery could be better
 Some on for os Screen 2070 Ah battery is not enough.... but it will give u full day with minimal usage
 Else everything is cool like display is awesome and touch also cool.... Front Camera is Very good with 2 M.P.
 Primary Camera is Very Good with outdoor Photos not with indoor photo
 Gaming graphics is Very good with no last
 its stock andros so interface is Very good but for me By previous Bony UI interface was better than this one as it was a customized UI.
 Overall I will give 3 Star to MOTO G and gen with all Gros and cost
 Hope my review will help you guns to chose the best one
 Thanks

 I have been using this phone for 6 months now
 The phone suffices all the requirements of a smartphone.
 Os very competitive prices
 I had To delivery issues from Flipkart.
 The camera music player and all are pretty good
 The camera intact is pretty impressive for a point and shoot and portrait photography
 The other useful features are of course having the latest andros Not too impressed with Android lollipop thought 16GB Internal memory plus the option of extending the memory with a memory stick earlier Moto G lacked this and features like moto assist goose synchronization to display all my calendar entries travel/play/movie booking etc Plus there is no bloatware stuffed by Motorola.
 Battery life is also very decent
 Only thing lacking is a detachable charge
 Also there is no USB cable provided alongwith the phone for data transfer
 Not sure why Motorola has done this
 Otherwise I have no complains
 The screen size display and overall feel of the phone material is very good
 All in all a handy phone and can be bought for the wonderful price that it is offered at

 I purchased 4 moto go phone from flipkart at various times in the last one years
 I am an ardent lover of moto g honest
 I had lot of respect for the professionalism flipkart shows in selling/delivering/addressing problems of the customers
 Now it is not there anymore
 The latest phone which I have received had number of issues
 1.
 To voice clarity The speaker makes crackling noise
 His is the problem seen in 3 out of 4 phone I purchased(only 1 phone is good
 Two are to be replaced by flipkart after lot of struggle/discussion with customer care
 The latest one I received is the worst of all
 The noise is so much that I can listen what the other person is speaking
 2. Top speaker of the phone is not working There are two speaker one on the top and another at the bottom
 Top speaker doesn work at all 3. Camera quality is bad The phone has 8 up camera but it is worse than 5 up camera of any samson phone
 Pixellation is seen in the images
 The worst part is yet to come
 I have given complaint about all these to flipkart, 3 times till now
 There is no proper response
 First time I received a call
 They spoke some thing which I could not listen because of problem in the phone
 I asked them to call back again
 They didn call
 I raised second complaint
 they called me and told that they will send a service person within 2 days
 To body turned up even after 3 days
 Not even anyone called
 Today I raised third complaint
 I dont know whether they will settle the matter or not
 His experience made me to lose my confidence not only on moto phone but also on flipkart.
 I am not a flipkart fan any more
 Thank you flipkart.
 I cannot rate this experience as zero so rate with one start

 Lollipo Design and easy one hand operation Sons Would have been increased to 2390 similar to Moto Os To Preinstalled Mile manager apes all the third party download apes are ad supported , which i hate to use

 His is a ₹11,000 phone that you can enjoy for 4 months
 Of you can afford that go for it
 I heard good things about the Moto G and gen phone and bought two--one for myself and one for my daughter
 Flipkart service was prompt no complaints there
 The phone looks and feels beautiful but within four months of buying it I could not hear well
 I took it to the service centre which was very far from my home
 In Kolkata, Motorola's service centres are far from the city centre
 And the service at the Diamond Harbour Road service centre is horrible
 They couldn care less that you are travelling more than an hour in terrible heat and humidity to get your new phone service
 Once you have bought the phone it is your worry even if this is well within the one-year warranty period of the phone
 Horse within a week of getting it service the phone showed the same problems
 Within a couple of days it developed a new problems the screen started heating up
 Unfortunately for me the second time I sent it to the service centre my husband suddenly fell very ill and went into a coman
 He was in ICU and I had no phone
 An you imagine how distressful that is
 The service centre however was unfazed.
 They still took a week more to repair it
 When it was done I had to go and collect it taking out half a day for this while my husband was still in hospital
 The same day I collected it I realised the problem of not being able to hear still persisted
 Even days later the problem of the heated screen has started again
 I have complained again only I haven had the time to take the phone to the service centre yet
 Not once has Motorola offered to replace the phone
 Even after three rounds of complaints within just 6 months of buying it
 Once you buy their phone its your problems

 Gros : Vice build quality West in this prize 16 os is more that enough also external slot is available It can work if by accident you drop it or put into water for some time and wipe early
 Sons : It hangs if you load so many applications
 Reason is only 1 os Same but once you start it works fine
 Heavy weight if you put cover on it
 Bulky look
 Overall you can not get better mobile than in this prize range

 But replacing the screen was costly so i purchased this mobile
 Os is an average phone who fond of big screen at reasonable prices
 Rose 1. Screen size is big 2. Believe this phone does not get much heat when u play game for long time 3. Camera is good but not much compared with Karl Less lowered windows phone but still photos are good
 4. Android mitka / lollypop is good and rarely gets hangs or jerked
 5. Studio is good especially loudspeaker works like a speaker phone Sons 1.Poor battery life and the charger came with phone is poor it takes so much time to get charge the phone
 battery drains quickly as i used with windows phone (lollipop draws power 2. Headphone came with the mobile worth for 100 Os only no effect i am using JBL to get more pleasant sound 3. i feel lollipop os should be better it should have a single place to see modifications and quick buttons first wipe to see modifications and second wipe to see the quick launch buttons 4. Android os is not good during oncoming calls it displays oncoming call notificaiton at top of screen which is irritating 5. display which should have been better its just lcd not ambled screen need to have more brightness sometimes Its a average phone and its okay for the bucks spent

 System hangs too often forget about multitasking smart phone
 Battery life is good but heat unto uncomfortable levels
 Charger quality is bad

 Looked good before I actually purchased it but I definitely consider it an available option now

 I bought this phone on flipkart in November 2014.
 The phone size and camera quality is good
 However with time the phone gets hanged even after putting (16GB sd cards and the battery also gets drained very fast
 Os the makers said that it has a long battery life however after 6 months its getting hanged battery gets drained easily and the speaker is not so loud as expected
 I wish the screen brightness was better outdoor
 But overall performance for surging and other apes are fine
 Its good for social networking as the screen size is just perfect

 I had been using this phone for last Two Weeks and had never faced any problems
 Earlier I was using a windows phone and bought this phone to experience the latest version of Android.
 The battery back up is bit low compared to my Lumia-720 , but the touch screen and fluidity for usage is excellent
 All the apes run smoothly
 Highly recommended by me...

 I am rating it as co of the features it provides me with the price i got it
 The processor is very good and there is no hidden apes running in the background which might eat battery or slow the process
 The body look and feel is really great

 Once battery is celebrated its nice.But need to mention i dont play games os i just use it for songs , whatsapp, os and general couture browsing
 Overall i very satisfied !!!

 The phone looks good feels good and perform well too ... But the only problem with this is its echo issue os Yeah ... yours callers will be able to hear themselves ... over and over again ... over and over again os Os Not sure if it was this particular piece which was defective or if all the phone have the same issue ... have asked a replacement from Flipkart now
 Of you want your callers to hang up in the first 20-30 seconds of the conversation ... go for this phone os Trust me ... it does wonders that way os

 Product is os but filpkart services are getting worst these days One can only go for COD orders I think as the delivery person sitting 200 m from house find it extremely difficult to move his feet to such a miniscule distance and in the hot weather in has to go to by own vehicle to take the Stem Real shame for such services Only 1 star as the buying experience completely ruined due to such a bad experience .

 I had choice between on HTC 620G and MotoG2 based on the best specification for the best unfordable prices
 By heart was to HTC based on the reviews and came
 Last I was forced to switch to MotoG2 based on the price differences
 I had a very bad experiences seeing the mobile delivered had a screen defect with bright white spot in the screen which was disturbing and had to replace it immediately
 To my disappointment I was put to delayed formalities and I had to wait for 1 week due to online check delay
 Once done I had my Moto Os replaced and found to be a good performer
 Its a good choice for the price , i feel the camera is not to mark with 8 up especially the quality is not very good when its taken with room
 with all the price matters I feel good with these thoughts overall a GOOD choice

 I have used this mobile and ordered in Flipkart where the delivery is good and the mobile with good features at reasonable prices
 After buying this product please register your product at Motorola official webster support and get the information about the security of the mobile as it has the best feature to trace(which other mobile doesn have your mobile in case if you lost it
 Finally I can say that this mobile has good features which you canst get in any other bands
 To I suggest people to go with it
 Were is the mobile(Lenovo A6000 plus which has best features than this mobile but I am not sure about the review on it as it is released at the month end of April
 Its price(Lenovo A6000 plus is also less in Flipkart

 Flipkart service was good and I would rate 4.5 out of 5. Reason I didn rate it 5 because I faced some issues with courier/logistic but at the end it was good
 I used this phone with Mitka for around 1 month and it was awesome but as soon as I upgrade it to Lolipop it became an ordinary phone
 I dont know I should blame goose to launch such a garage IOS especially goose now launched in Lolipop) or I should blame Motorola guns who simply pushed Lolipop to this phone without even testing it with Moto G2.
 It the end of the day I would say Shone is good at this price and if one can compromise with some lag and battery back which comes once phone gets upgrade to Lolipop) then go ahead Also Lolipop 5.0.2 has some bags which I experience while using my phone
 Have a good one os Note Overall rating is not for Flipkart, its for the phone after using it for 6 months

 been months since i got this phone..its quite fast and works smoothly..the only trouble i noticed(which many others have faced took have searched in goose :P)is that sometimes rarely the whole battery drains out,..its like 20% one second and the other second its os and wants to shut down..its quite bothering if i dont have the charger available right at that time...i guess like any smartphone u need to keep closing the apes u dont use..other than that its smooth and works well

 A decent buy within 11K for users who want Motorola Grand and Build Quality Rose - Smooth interface decent speed with less apply and implacable build quality
 - Slo-mo feature in video mode - which I think no other brand offers within this price range - Will get all least 1 more update from Google - Feels nice to hold due to the matter finish rear panel - Support and Service will be better than all other Chinese competitors - Dear snapped click some awesome snap in daylight
 - Recent front snapped Sons - Seats up if you open multiple apes - I installed whatsapp, for instagram, tomato best chromic skype, soundcloud, twitter and a couple of games --> phone started behaving erratic and was freezing
 Starting the phone helped but that not what you want a multi-tasking phone to ask you to do - 1GB RAM is not sufficient for people who like to install many social media apply
 - Right shots are bad even with the flash
 - Using 2 SIM's can just make the phone a did with multiple apes - To Os even Moto E has Os now I would say buy this phone if your purpose in only I/C and O/G with a couple of social media apes like WA, os & Instagram.
 It would be wise to wait for the Moto G rd Men which I guess may boast a much needed 2GB RAM and Os LTE!

 Battery life less than 18 hours when data and wife are on Battery life less than 40 hours when data and wife are off Battery is in built so if and when it has to be changed it may be a problem Gets a little slow at times Contact sometimes take 2 to 3 seas to respond after touch I suggest buying a good power bank on the go

 only drawback i felt is battery backup.
 it does not last a day for low to medium use
 I can say if you are a heavy user u have to charge it twice a day
 one more issue is screen feel hot when you make call and touch phone to your ears
 give it 3.5 start

 got the device thou flipkart offer
 prose * morning gorilla glass - touch and display is good * comes with lollipop installed * camera is excellent * external Memory card option available * dual him option cost 1. the main issue is BATTERY DRAIN - it drains within a day for normal usage without wife and data usage might be due to lollipop os or gorilla glass display 2. can not reduce the resolution of the camera u can take only 5MP and 8 os photos for sending photos thou whatsapp and email it will be better to have some resolution settings
 3. pre installed apes from lollipop dealer and essaying there is no temple storage for messaging, which is available in every keyboard layout u had to install apes from goose play stores its working in sums but not in whatsapp 4. no USB charger cable

 The replacement mobile was old
 The Motorola seal was missing and they had used Sellotape as a seal
 I had to request the replacement request again
 The rd mobile was finally delivered on th May 2015.
 I am not sure whether this time they have delivered new/genuine mobile or not

 His is a really nice product from Motorola.
 After using it for about 6 months I can say that it is amazing for daily usage but has a few minor drawback
 The Gros and Sons are - Gros os Good battery life
 Lasts for about 2 days with normal usage os day if you play a lot of games etc os Great Screen for watching Bodies or YouTube and doesn give a lot of glare
 os Sturdy Build and feels really nice in your hands with the rubberised back
 os Expandable storage os Amazing Android Experience os Good and responsive Touchscreen.
 Doesn't really require a screen guard but I would recommend you to use one
 os Good sound quality
 Its not Amazing but still good speakers
 Prefer to use Earphones os Last Charging
 You can get a full charge in 3 hours or less
 Sons os 1 os RAM isn too great for a lot of heavy games
 Gives lag if you have a lot of apes on multi-tasking.
 But if you have normal usage its pretty good
 os In-the-box Earphones are not so good
 os Screen gets a lot of fingerprints unless you use a screen guards
 os You probably can get a lot of fancy Cases and Covers for it
 All in all its worth its money and a really good products
 Of you want to play A LOT of games and moves and use a lot of apply then you might need a better RAM.
 But for ordinary usage music social medial calling a few moves a few games video etc its good enough

 Never did i imagined that this would be so damn good looking not at all cheap from any angle guns
 Only issue - BATTERY!!! Gaming - its drains like crazy
 Needs twice a charging per day if you are a serious camera
 Network - not quite difference it doesn matters if you are on wife or go draining time is the same
 Entertainment - quite good while listening music but not while watching moves still os while watching a min os series
 Web Browsing/Multitasking - no issue at all
 Takes about couple of hours max to charge it fully
 Overall I would say not at all bad for a 2070mAh battery
 Not Android Lollipop 5.0.2 straight out of the box

 Using Moto G 2 for 2 weeks its battery is the worst one it takes 4 hours to charge it fully
 When takes another 4 hours to hit the zero mark
 Internal Memory is not accessible through the default pp available You have install some other third party pp to access your internal memory and os cards
 Some unnecessary Google Pp is there instead of the useful ones
 Round quality is also not good if you want to watch a movie you have to use a head phone otherwise sound is not audible properly that "FULL STEREO SOUND" is just an eye wash
 While making a phone call the speaker sound is not audible from 0.5 ft distance properly
 And if speaker is enabled proximity senior is not working
 Didn't expect this type of quality from Motorola.
 Camera is good but takes longer time to get the focus
 Front camera angle is not that wide
 Good thing is its vagrant display
 Before this I have used Samsung Y Quos I though it(MOTO) would be better that this but not
 Utterly disappointed

 I bought this phone 10 days back and its rapid battery discharge has taken a toll now...I have just raised a return request
 Its battery only last for max 4 hours after charging it to 100 % ...Today when i got up its battery was just 15 % and when i plugged in for charging it suddenly charged up to 100% after using for an hour , the phone got shut
 Such a defective piece is this...Really sad with such a purchase from flipkart.
 His was my first purchase of an electronic item from flipkart and it resulted into such a disappointment .

 It seems they have sent a used phone to me
 I got phone with lolipop andros but all my friends received it with andros mitka and they updated it by their own
 His has serious battery draining issue
 Not at all satisfied with the purchase
 Feel degraded
 Have five star so that they dont hide the review based on rating
 Please beware
 Flipkart is not genuine as before
 Some news came that moto go is out of stock already and they are selling returned items by refurbishing it
 Please beware flipkart is not as before

 1. GRAPHICS os SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND2 WILL NOT GET ANY CHANCE with compare to MOTO Os GRAPHICS.I think the SAMSUNG GALAXY buyer will be jealous by hearing this.... but its real true have compared these two and found the difference
 Graphics is too good in MOTO G2, after Lollipop upgrade the looks changed Ambient display feature available which will adjust the brightness automatically according to the surrounding
 2.Battery back awesome..at least 24 hours with 4 hours g usage in variable network
 It will take exact 4 hours to charge fully from 0 percent to 100 percent that means 25% charge gain in 1 hours
 3.Camera is of good quality
 4.Speaker quality is also very good
 have mentioned these all features of MOTO G2, and I believe in that price this is the best phone in market
 wont think a lot........just go for it and be happy os

 I will not review the product as there are many reviews here
 I would like to comment on the flipkart support which I felt is pathetic
 I am buying product on flipkart since a few years now first time I had to actually seek the help from support as the phone delivered to me was defective
 The touch screen was not at all working
 First you get a mail from support to download/install some pp for troubleshooting.
 Wonder how can one do it if the phone is not at all working Next you have to wait for the call from their technical people who are given the powers to accept/reject your replacement request
 The worst part is if you happen to miss the call due to any reason its your headache to call support again to schedule the callback.
 The support guns keep on asking to do some useless things which is difficult for a new person new to technology to do fearing hesse may damage the device in the process
 I had to call in support 4 times in 4-5 days before my replacement was accepted
 Think of the pain one goes through especially after paying the full amount for a defective piece
 The worst part about this purchase was that I had gifted it to somebody
 The real test for anything is in times of trouble
 By first experience with the lip part support had been terrible
 By perception about flipkart has changed and I will think 100 times before placing an order again if I decide to every

 i ordered motor in the offer 2000 off more than a month ago but the phone had cost me even more than its actual prize and its just lying like a toy
 From the and day of delivery its software was giving me problems
 its display goes blank automatically
 Flipkart's smartapp check was unable to find the problem and so they rejected my return request every time
 They wasted my 1 month like this and then said that return policy is over so go to the service center where it was told to me that there was a bug in the software so they updated it
 It worked well for 2 days and now again the same problems
 Flipkart is neither replacing the cell not defending my money and i m still with a moto go toy
 It least toy works
 Feeling like i donate ask to flipkart.

 Received a defective piece from flipkart and flipkart is processing it but after using Moto G st Men for a year and Moto G(2nd Men for a weeks I can say that Moto G(2nd Men is no way closer to Moto G(1st Gen)..
 His hands has a serious defect with microphone Moto G(2nd Men is a poor quality product both hardware wise and software wise screen not enough touch sensitive and we need to be press screen to select option - so it is a press screen not touch screen it has many other problems I cannot list on flipkart.. in one line I suggest others not to go for this faulty product from motorola - but flipkart as usual is good at its work giving 1 star only for Flipkart service and no stars for Motorola's Moto G(2nd Gen)..
 I would suggest flipkart not dump these waste motorola handiest and loose your customers for people reading this review - please dont waste your money like me

 Moto G...I bought it on with April 2015.
 Not even a month now and I am facing issues with music player
 Very time you want to listen to music you have to report the phone
 Which as per me is a manufacturing defect but thanks to flipkart they have rejected for replacement of this handset.
 Hence will never recommend anyone to buy anything from Flipkart every
 Genuine Request to all..Don't buy anything dam thing from flipkart.
 And if anyone is facing any issues with them pull them to court....So that they dont fool around with poles hard earned money

 I have been using this product for about a months complained to Flipkart "Twice" that the product was sub-standard ( phone hangs on using multiple apply touch is pathetic battery life 2-3 hours on g etc and was directed to Moto G care centre for the same
 These highly helpful team of "professionals" at the centre told me that the product was liked by millions and I was a fool to think otherwise i shouted and fought for my right and was told that that the best they provide and the problem is pigment of my imagination
 Head Down I returned and am stuck with this phone

 By peri c was stolen that when i planned to buy a phone under ask range

 I want wrong
 The phone is lawless
 Not it with Lolipop version
 I bought it for Rs.12,999/-, days later i saw that the price was reduced to 10,999/- os that was the only sad part
 To doubt this phone stands as one of the best phone under ask range
 Os far as phone for best series is concerned well Peri Os steals the show os Also peri c has better battery back up when compared to moto go

 Not surprisingly for me the stock andros experience is far better than the customized or so called enhanced os that other bands pack their phone with
 Of the accessories were not so expensive and if it had come with a USB cable the Moto G and Men would've been the perfect and smartphone for me
 I am not saying it canst be the first it would've been but for the reasons stated before
 Flipkart delivery was well before their stated date and I was kept informed about the status all along
 Thumbs up to Flipkart for that

 To I got this mobile in March
 I was really impressed with the build quality and features
 Too good at this range
 But on the with day from the date of delivery I saw that the touches were not registered properly
 Enabling the show touches option I noticed that touches were registered in three four places where I didn touch at all
 I immediately tried to file a return but the return products link is gone
 I sent a mail to Flipkart and two days after that (31st day I was told since 30 days are gone they wont replace it and that I should go visit a service center
 May to go FK! Leading the other reviews it seems to me that os just sent me a refurbished products

 I had been using this phone for last 5 months and I am having a great experience with Moto-G and Generation
 Its Android lollypop is very advanced and provides more features in O.S.
 The hardware is much unable and battery life is sufficient to support Os internet browsing for 6-7 hours continuously
 Camera clarity is excellent and the phone comes with a novel feature of continuous flash during video recording
 Flipkart has an amazing delivery and customer service
 To my surprise after 5 days of my purchase I was informed by flipkart that I had been selected as one of the 100 lucky dinners for full cash reward idea my cell phone was absolutely free!!!
 Of you are really looking for a unable and advanced smart phone in a budget of 10-15K then motor is the right option
 Lastly thanks to Flipkart for the Lucky Prize

 I ordered 2 moto gas one is working fine but the other one came with both him shots broken I am still waiting for Flipkart to contact me despite calling their customer service number 3 times
 His is actually pretty bad since motorola is only available via flipkart The rating is not for the phone but for the entire ordering/getting broken item and then having to wait

 I have used this product now over 3 months and it works well just that i noticed a few lag during gameplay that is because of the 1 os ram.Battery back is fine lasts a day with moderate usage & i just dont like the fact that it takes almost 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.
 Overall its a great product from Motorola.

 His is really outrageous that once flipkart delivered me the defeated product which was having too much heating issue and now the piece which have been delivered to me after replacement is a piece of june
 I am trying to download various apes from goose stores
 but this is not being completed
 i have tried this on Wi-fi as well as on Os connectivity.
 this is now really not acceptable
 I dont want this piece of june and i dont want any replacement
 I want the refund of my money
 The Moto G delivered by flipkartis not worth even a single Rupee.

 I ordered Moto G and genu i received 1 but with a faulty charge phone was not getting charged i placed the replacement over the webster i got a message from flipkart stating that they will contact me by May and by 3:00Pm, no one cared to call me i callback they said i have to wait for the call from the technical team
 I called flipkart next day then they said i will get a call within 4 hours again no called then i called them again n fortunately i got to speak to someone in technical team and that guy was giving me grand i told him that i have tried using different charges but the phone is not taking the charge but that stubborn guy kept on saying go to your home call me i will help you bloody i told him it is the hardware issue how can u help me by telling me the settings
 than at last i spoke to his Team leader and thank god that guy had some brains and understood my pain and processes the request for the replacement which will reach me bu May the
 i paid days back and still i do not have the working phone with me
 Pathetic Experience with Flipkart .
 Not at all a customer central company

 It is a good product only for 10000 Rs.Because battery back is not satisfactory at all.Lots of application are thereto battery back facility should be Enhance.Camera(both still & vedio) are superb.Overall
 You can enjoy the products
 Flipcart should not pressure the customer to save there card details.It should be optional

 I ordered MOTO G and gen .
 After 5 days got the phone which was not directing the SIMs .
 After contracting customer care they did all type of trouble shooting by phone..taking all my balance and time
 Old to download a software..when i was unable to load any him to it..it really sucks
 After 10 days when requested to refund if they can replace in time..same recorded message after long phone holds by customer care .." sir we are extremely sorry..and you will get update in 24 his now its 14 days extending the date of delivery and still with the defective peice... will go to consumer forum with this ... it sucks really advice to not to go for flipkart rather go for other sites .

 we just brought the mobile by believing that the flipkart is a good authenticity and genuine seller
 But even it will just escape when we have any trouble with the device and just wait to cross the days replacement period after which they are not responsible
 Anyway its the best mobile ever had

 I bought the phone recently for 9899 os
 Its worth buying
 Everything is awesome except the battery .
 Its taking almost 2.5 to his to full charge which is very bad
 Also the battery will drain out in 6 to 7 hours if you use Internet

 Flipkart service has come down... the charger came along with Moto G was not working
 I raised a complaint to replace it
 It has been two months now still they are replacing the charger.. Shone is a good buy
 But not sure whether Flipkart expects me to use the phone without a charger Eating for Flipkart service phone charger and not for the phone as such

 Everything is great good looking powerful hardware and clear sharp display
 One thing about its that the Security level of the phone is very high which is unable too much
 After all the thing i realized that the battery back should be more
 its simply amazing...
