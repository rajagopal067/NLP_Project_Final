 The best andros phone
 Combination of price and functionality make it best andros phone me
 You can say that some samson or Bony are better and yes they may give you a little bit more functionality a little bit more not much but they charge twice or three time more
 And this is unlocked phone

 His is the best available phone in the market at that range .
 The only draw back of the same is even when they have a os GSM and a Global GSM they must have added the g network to it as well
 Specially when the moto g must generation has g option
 But other than that its a delete to own it .

 For the money this phone is a top pick
 The os is plenty big but not too big
 The price is right at a little under $200; and the phone so far works fantastic
 Also love the fact that its unlocked and not tied to any carriers so that I can switch whenever I want to

 Great Desing, comfortable use with both hands there no better price-quality relation in a smartphone.
 Maybe with the size increase of the screen ( vs st Men Moto G), motorola should have introduced a bigger battery but in general terms this is a great acquisition

 I was skeptically in buying this phone because I wanted to use it in Indian

 Promoted by OTA to update the device the day I got it
 I updated it right away(5.0.2), what a mistaken
 The phone is so slow its practically unusable.
 Extreme last not sure if it was any better on 4.4.4,
 but this is just horrible
 The apes crash all the time

 I bought this phone for my wife
 The owned a BLU Life Lay Os After about a year its starting to freeze up so I decided to go with a more reputable company like Motorola.
 With all the positive views here on amazon I bought it off Bay New Open Box).
 It worked great for a couple of weeks
 I own a used Samsung Os (Red) and I didn want my wife to have all the bloatwear so the Moto G and Men was it
 I love the phone itself
 To bloatwear, better battery life that my S4, lollipop is simple and smooth for my wife who is not a power user or very techie.
 Screen was an upgrade and looked great despite all the negative reviews the lowest setting is dark but with it up a little there are no issues with clarity its a really good picture
 The front facing speakers sounded awesome.
 Also despite all the negative about the speaker volume yes its not the loudest but understand that most phone dont need to be that loud and most of the time they give up quality for volume
 These sounded great and my wife listens to her phone every morning while getting ready
 The look and feel is pretty nice considering the prices curved back the matter white is really nice no finger prints like on my S4.
 its a little thick (11mm) for me as for my wife not an issue
 Micro sd slot is always a must with me and was happy to see that they had it vs their Moto X not having it.So lets talk about the negative and why I sent it back
 After about 2 weeks the phone went dead and my wife thought she had plenty of battery life
 I plugged it in and it said 0%.
 While it was dark in the living room I noticed that the screen was backlit while charging which I thought was odd
 I plugged it and tried to turn it on
 It slipped through the load screens and then when back to the black backlit screen
 I tried volume up power and got to a factory rest screen and tried that no luck same result
 I got to send it back and get my money back.With all that said... I really liked this phone I and him in the process of looking for another phone and would consider buying this new
 But him so disappointed in the experience and what really others me is the fact that I could take the battery out and rest the phone that way
 I like companies like Motorola, Samsung and BLU that make unfordable phone for us Straight Talk or repaid plan users
 His experience didn completely hate Motorola but it did deter me from buying from them for a while
 Remember is was a New (Other) or open box so their might have been issues underlying that phone
 To read the other reviews here and maybe this phone is for your
 I just wanted to note my experiences as hope to help
 I have reviews on the Samsung In SIII, BLU Life Lay Os BLU Studio 5.0 LTE, all Studio In LTE, BLU Life 8 and the Samsung Galaxy Os (Red) here on amazon
 His is a good phone for the price hopefully you will have better luck if you buy it new

 His phone is for light use only
 Of you want a phone for light usage with a large screen for checking email and such this phone is for you
 However if you know a little more than how to use it look elsewhere.When
 I bought this I though I could live with supper specs.I bought this phone a few months ago
 The large screen is nice for netflix, the front facing speakers are strong average but much more convenient than back/side speakers and the design of the phone is okay--the plastic on the back cover is very soft so buy a case.The battery life gets worse and quickly
 I may have just gotten a bad phone but with 1200 may battery meant for its predecessor which is significantly smaller battery life is as expected.The camera is great for taking pictures of textbook pages and wherever there is a lot of light
 His is a standard camera but not completely horrible
 The screen ardor the camera is very dull
 Adjust situation levels for normal looking colors.It does run stock andros with a lollipop update right out of the box which is nice as well.(I
 prefer stock andros vs TouchWiz...)As with most Motorola products it takes forever to start up but the phone processing power is average
 I have found it can have a surprising amount of webpages and apes open at a time but I think the phone pauses the apes to its best ability while in the background.Up until recently the battery has been acting like an end-of-contract iPhone, and it has been over heating
 I have noticed 5-10% drops within the hours just having cellular on no data
 Getting full day battery means airplane mode and battery save mode a lollipop features when you use the phone on wife or data competitor to this phone would be the os Os Rigor as the battery life is 2450 may and removable same screen size better color and has expandable memory as well do not recommend this phone if you want to use it at all.Important specs:NON removable battery card sloth front facing speakers inch screen him card shots

 His is a review based on the 2 days have had this device
 I needed phone fast after I broke my HTC One M7.
 Being stuck in a contract and no discount available I needed the best discount phone I could find
 The Moto G and Generation has not disappointed for the prices bought the phone used and it was considered in Very Good status because of supposed small scratches on the removable and replaceable back
 The phone actually came in Like New."
 To scratches whatsoever
 Must one of the many pleasant surprise I got from this phone!Battery Life To far so good easily lasts longer than my old M7.
 By no means are you going to last all day if you are on it all day but the experts have said they can get 4 hours on screen time before the battery dies
 Unless your watching moves and constantly on your phone you'll be able to easily last the day maybe even 2 days for some people
 To long battery save apes that dont work anyway!Screen: The 5 inch screen looks awesome.
 For being 720p, I was worried and notice a huge difference
 its the best 720p resolution phone have seen
 The one problem is it doesn get very bright to the point you can clearly see in direct sunlight.Design: Great feel in the hand very secure feeling
 hats something I needed to compensate on the Os as the aluminium build was very slippery
 The dual screen sterno speakers are a nice touch not the greatest out there but certainly better than most phone with the volume in one spot on the back of the phone.Software: Pretty much Stock Android, no bloatware, the way Android was meant to be Thank you Motorola!
 Sometimes I notice it takes about 3 seconds for the home screen to load back up after existing certain apply
 Nothing serious by any means but you will notice the processor is a little slower than flagship devices that is to be expected
 Works pretty well given it only has 1GB of RAM.
 Must be sure to close out the apes you dont need to reduce chances of slowdowns.Network: Os with the Global Version on AT&T, that kind up a summer but saves a ton of battery life
 Luckily I have If at Some and Work plus all the public places where there is free Wifi.
 Otherwise the Os network is suitable although noticeably slower than LTE.
 I do have to say the If on this phone extends much further on this phone than my M7, so I was extremely happy about that!Camera: Not an expert on the camera
 From professional reviews there are better camera out there but to me it seems good enough for me who rarely takes many photo
 For a discount phone thought I highly doubt you'll find a better camera.Storage: It 8GB about 4.5-5GB unable for the user you may need to get a micro os cards I got one that 32GB on Amazon for about $16.
 Some apes allow you to store on the os cards some donate
 It some point you may need to decide which apes are worth keeping and which are not because of that issue if they dont all write to your os Card.Also has an os Radio Tuner!!!!To sum this review up I have been pleasantly surprised about all the great things about this phone
 It does virtually everything very well
 I bought it as a replacement phone until my contract is ready for a new flagship device but so far this may be my phone of choice for a while

 All around it is a good phone
 I previously have had a Gumma 800, Gumma 521, and now I have a Moto G (US GSM version
 By advice is to immediately buy the Samsung Vo class 10 32GB micro card because the storage is pretty small and imho, I dont trust sands for heavy use since their cards tend to die on me
 His seems like an added expense but 8GB goes really fast so you'll want to move your apes to the micro card so that you can actually use the phone
 That being said with a micro Hard the small storage DOES NOT ruin the phone
 His phone works fabulously.
 its relatively fast its build quality is the highest have ever seen in this price brackets the screen pipes are visible at some angles but its never too bad its only an annoyance if you are very picked
 The phone comes with almost stock andros and shortly after opening it my phone received the upgrade to Lollipop.
 One grievance is that this phone uses an ARMv7 processor and therefore lacks hardware level encryption support so if you encrypt this phone you'll take a performance penalty
 Also another drawback to this phone is that it lacks NFC and that makes me doubt the availability of forthcoming features in the andros operating such as Android May for this particular phone
 All in all I would buy this phone again because quite frankly you canst beat the price that this phone is selling for and once you consider what you get for the prices its one hell of a deal
 I would recommend buying the extended warranty from Lenovo/Motorola (Lenovo owns Motorola) as it is by far the cheapest extended warranty you can buy and includes accident damage coverage
 You have 30 days if my memory serves correct after date of purchase to buy the warranty through the motorola website.TLDR: decent phone at a price too good to pass up just remember a micro Hard

 i absolutely love it i could not describe it better
 i bought this phone 3 months ago which i consider is enough testing time first with the kit at andros version it comes with and then with the lollipop andros version both of them run smoothly on the phone which is fast and has a great performance even when it runs out of memory for more apes i accept i exaggerated installing stuff i didn need but i was testing the camera both back and front have a very nice resolution the gorilla glass screen really works (REALLY!
 there no need of using a screen protector if you plan to use the phone with the usual care its not heavy and for those of you that are not completely sure of using a phone with these dimensions believe me once you have it in your hands you are not giving it away the screen size makes it very comfortable to write see pictures and video the battery life is good it takes a long time to get fully charged os to 4 hours but for me it works fine i use it a lot and it last more than 12 hours until you need to activate the battery saving mode... also the sound of the speakers in the front is great but honestly what i most love of it is the design of the operative system different from most andros honest it is simple practical yet beautiful not like all that green and black venus i was used to....with this phone i also bought a samson galaxy Os mind and i have compared my moto G 2 with it and so many other phone i phone os os os etc one various sonya xperia, huawei, blue and more what can i say it is superior to samson in many ways and has nothing to envy from i phone and htc.I love my moto G os i highly recommend it and ism not planning to change it in a very long time so go ahead and BUY!

Christian Gouvia
 have had this phone for almost a months running 5.0.2
 Lollipop for the majority of the time
 It is still performing as expected...no lag or freezing of any kind despite its aged processor
 A bug fix is being sent via OTA soon because of slight battery drain and a pitch that involves a blank but consistent Google Lay Music ratification in the status bare
 The only way to get rid of it is to kill the pp open it then kill it a second time
 Should be fixed soon though.The screen is still crisp but its IPS display does not perform as well in bright outdoor light
 For a budget phone its an amazing display
 The gorilla glass is also scratch and smudge resistant but you should still invest in a protector to be safe
 The body is not much bigger than the screen and like its Moto Family sports a curved backing to fit perfectly in your palm.There is no issue with gaming or multitasking.
 The camera is 8 os on the back and 2 os on the front
 I was surprised at the quality of the front-facing, or "selfie," camera
 its quality isn far away from its 8 os counterpart
 All quality is great on both ends which I tested with a few calls
 The physical speakers play sound adequately enough perfect for video and music for yourself but not enough to fill a room.Despite a few small stacks here and there you still get a os display with formidable speck and the latest Android OS.
 Also downloading Clean Master will really help your performance
 It clears RAM usage every time the phone is unlocked and keeps it running very smoothly

 review for smart phone motorola Moto G and generation - about $179only have it for 2 days
 the size is a funny thing - if you use it as navy system in the car or for picture viewing you want a big screen - if for phone usage or to put it in the pocket it should be smaller
 it feels fairly slipper and i always fear that i will drop it
 would be nice to have nicer grip feeling
 so no clear judgment here but i would prefer a smaller size.screen is good - also visible in sunny environment was trying to define some speed dealing numbers and had goose for help over I think very unable and the price is unbeatable.now
 some trouble
 The location feature to only use GPS never got any satellite signal - tried several GPS apes - no success
 growled it and found that many people had similar issues and some recommendation went so far as to send it back as defective or root the device software experts again Os cannot blame the people
 but here my simple solution until the software is fixed as usual - software bug
 if you ENABLE all location features web cell signal and GPS) it works - with normal GPS reception
 not sure why software developer can miss that one but then we know they are also only human even they believe they are closer to super human.camera is nice but lens location seems awkward - I tend to cover the lens with the left finger if I use it as it would be convenient.HDR feature shows improved quality use a repaid data plan (H20 - h2owireless.com-had to perform manual set to get to the internet balance stays for 90 days which is better than 30 days from many other provides and therefore I am observant of the usage
 it seems the phone reasonably tongues to wife as soon it is in proximity.there is a data transfer monitoring feature in this OS but I have not figured out how good the information actually is could set the phone in my car fiat 500e) with Bluetooth and it works fine for phone usage
 I have not figures out how to play the audit music through Bluetooth.battery
 life with GPS wife Bluetooth and internet browsing including listening to internet radio seems ok for 1 day).overall
 very responsive behavior it uses microSIM card which is not a big deal in general because the card is only different in the plastic around the contact - so you can cut away the plastic carefully and make it work I was lucky that my nearby T-Mobile store had a little utter tool and they cut my card from SIM to microSIM for free
 just keep remaining part of the stout and you and still use the microSIM with this part together when SIM is needed
 bow the same works for nanoSIM.I found some reviews complaining over the os radio
 no complains here it worked fine and picked up weak stations same way as all my other dedicated os radius
 some problems may be related to the length of the headphone cable which acts as antenna.
 so easiest way to check if reception is poor to try an other headphone cable.it
 only takes one SIM.
 also nice that it has a micro slot.disadvantage is that both shots are only accessible when back cover removed and removing the back cover can be somewhat tricky wish it had a replaceable battery so one could easily swap out but no battery is built-in.android
 4.4.4
 seems ok but certain things are not really intuition cups - am I complaining again about software os Os will update how it behaves after dropping it on the ground and after accidently dropping it in water - ha hang also booked a flight to the space station and will report on its behavior in zero gravity

 Good budget phone running stock android.
 The most impressive thing about the phone is its hardware
 It has front facing speakers and its build quality is pretty good as well
 IMO, this is the perfect size for a smartphone.
 its not too big and bulky but its not small either
 Stock andros is also a plus
 The phone only has 1 go of ram but it only uses about 500 mb because its running on stock android.
 It also has expandable memory
 The camera on this phone is good for the prices but bad compared to high end honest
 Os for the weaknesses of the phone its running stock andros this is also a strength because of stock andros minimalist designed
 him not a fan of google's photo viewer or google's music player so I ended up having to download a rd party photo viewer and music player which isn as good as Samsung's.
 A lot of people are a fan of goose play music but him not
 him not a fan of google's photo viewer either because I canst tell which photos are on my sd card and which photos are on the phone
 I also canst transfer photos from the phone to the sd card using the goose photo viewer something that I was able to do on a Samsung).
 The other weakness of this phone is that it doesn have g LTE.
 its not a big deal because HSPA+ is fast as well but its something that worth mentioning
 Contrary to popular belief I think you could find a phone that as good as this for around the same prices
 It probably wont be running stock android, but I really dont care about that anymore the
 Off the top of my head I could name 3 phone that have owned that are better than this and also in the same price range as this Optimus L90, Galaxy Avant, and the ZTE Max

 I picked 3 stars only because as my mouse pointer covered over it out popped "It's okay
 hats pretty much my feeling about this phone
 wont get me wrong its a good phone but I didn get any now factor from it.ATT is my provider and I had a Os until it met its end in a liquid accident
 I could not go a day without a phone for work so I pried my sons os Windows Shone from his fingers
 He had a expensive Foka 635, which was his replacement after he thrashed his phone
 I use my cell to check email make the occasional call get directions occasional mobile banking and testing
 hats it not a heavy user at all
 To for those limited activities I give Moto G 3 stars.Moto G is a decent phone no doubt about it but IMO its over prices by about 50 bucks
 Maybe my opinion will change when Lollipop gets released next weeks but after having Montana for 2 weeks Goggle Now doesn cut it for me
 him in my care a 2015 Elantra, quite a bit and bluetooth with the Moto is if sometimes
 Volume call quality etc... Battery life is sons even with battery save turned on
 him just not impressed
 him thinking I could have saved a few bucks and gone with BLU or waited for the new Samsung to come out.The os with Montana worked fearlessly with Bluetooth in my care
 It was my first experience with a cell phone now factor
 It would automatically pair every time without fail or incident
 And the kicked it would interrupt my music or whatever I was listening to on the radio on on os to tell me I had a call or a text and give me the option to respond or ignore
 It would also cut in on my radio listening when I was using navigation mode
 Now perhaps there is a way to get an andros phone to do this without having to switch my cars audit system constantly to media mode but I dont think so.Of course if you like access to tons of apply the andros phone or an phone is the phone for you
 His Moto G is every bit as good as my S3, and of course way less expensive
 Of your looking for a good hands free experience it pains me to say but a cheap os at half the cost of Moto G might be a better choice for you
 Anyway just my opinion

 I didn want to buy yet another expensive phone when I crushed my galaxy
 I seem to be accident prone and destroy every phone that I acquired
 Didn't know anything about the newer moto phone as I hadn seen one in forever until I noticed a classmate using one
 To I found them here
 I went back and fourth between the E,G and X and read all of the teach reviews
 I loved the price of the G since I was looking for something really cheap and liked the look of the customizable model Os
 I settled on the G because it was newer than the G and has a larger screen.Its a good very basic phone
 Wont expect any bells or whistles
 Os a former shone user its definitely a huge step down
 But if you are looking for a good value I recommend its cheap as it is it doesn look or feel cheap
 Love the screen quality and the subtle matter white causing which the guy at mobile admired
 Speed is oka a little slow
 I will have to to get an os card.Do note that this takes a micro him from t-mobile.
 I had to swing by and buy one to use this phone.Battery life is excellent almost as good as my shone was but much much better than the Galaxy
 Lasts over 24 hours wont go into the speck because you probably read all of those reviews.This is a basic handsome phone that is well worth the small price tags
 D do it again but would pay attention to the warnings about how basic it is.Amazon was ( and still is sold out so I bought mine straight from Motorola- which I hated to doubt arrived to me from Long Long in 2 days once it finally shipped
 I would have preferred to buy it from Amazon if D had the choice

 Before buying this phone I shortlisted multiple phone based on features I wanted using the gsmarena.com.
 Part from this phone all other unlocked andros (kitkat or Os phone were more than double as expensive
 I already purchased and returned "Blu Life One few months earlier due to some issues with the phone
 But this Moto G and Men seems to be working fine till now
 Recently it has been upgrade to Android Lollipop also
 There may be some shortcomings for some people edge
 To Os LTE, but HSPA+ works fine for me
 I have global GSM version so check Os and HSPA+ frequency of your provider before buying
 Camera is nice takes good quality pictures
 Although not full os 1080p, but only 720p for moves
 To predestined picture modes either
 Front camera is average
 Another thing which could be troublesome is only 8GB internal memory out of which Android itself take more than half probably
 Os of now no issues but over the time as andros and other apes gets updated this memory may prove less
 In Indian same phone comes with 16GB internal memory
 Wont know why they canst have 16GB model option here in US.
 Does not comes with headphone or screenguard or cover so you have to get those separately
 Sometimes I feel that when I talk putting the phone on left ear the voice is feeble as compared to right ears but that could just be my ears although I never felt that effect with any other honest
 Battery lasts 24-48 his for me I mostly use it for checking email news some video candor overall 1.5-2 his and very few phone calls and messages
 Hope this helps os

 Excellent phone I am very happy with because it works very well
 The only bad thing is that having just a month and a half I use the battery lasts less time than when they received having the same use so giving it four stars

 Great Smart Shone for the prices
 You only pay $180.00 and you get a great Android experience
 The os slot is super helpful and camera is a big improvement from last years
 Also this phone with be able to upgrade to Android Os

 Somehow Motorola did great with this one considering its a Snapdragon 400! Smooth sappy performance combined with a nice 720p screen make this phone a winner at less than $200.
 Camera's the only thing that lackluster.

 Os a previous shone user my wife old 3GS), I needed to upgrade to something with more battery life and an OS that would allow me to run the latest apply
 His phone did not disappoint me
 I got the phone stuck my SIM card from the shone in it and was working immediately
 Data set was a little additional trouble but not much
 Must some settings from my tireless carriers web site.My user profile dont back on the phone like some and discipline my internet habits so I use Black Tireless pay as you go which costs $0.05/minute voice and text and $0.10/MB data
 By cell usage rarely exceeds $5.00/month.
 Os its like a small tablet with emergency internet and phone when needed.The screen is larger than the 3GS, battery life longer and him no longer in the Apple ecosystem but went into the Google system
 The system is 3G-only, but being a pay as you go ($.10/MB data that a benefit since its easier to keep track of data usage when it doesn roar thou as fast
 I turn it on when I really need the internet and am away from WiFi, then turn it off
 I use OSMAND which is not even available for the iPhone) maps which unlike Google maps allows me to navigable while off-line.
 Anyway who really needs Os speed on a phone got a 32 os memory card and now have around 40 os total for an additional $19.00.
 Apple charges lots more for built-in memory.GPS works well
 Last first fix holds on well.Great buy in my opinion
 and do it again and recommend it to others

 have owned a few different smart honest shone os shone os Galaxy S3, and an old model of the Galaxy Ice
 I prefer the Samsung phone to the Apple honest most notably because of the ability to handle music file transfers using MTP.The Moto Os similar to the Galaxy Ice I previously owned came with no discernible manufacture branded bloatware.
 There are some Motorola branded settings and apply but they agent fluttering the pp list and they agent attempting to manipulate me into using them
 There are some other apes that are useless to me but these things are intrinsic to Android, and I wont fault the phone for that
 Os an aside one major disappointment for me with the latest version of andros was the removal of the Music Layer pp leaving the excessive Lay Music as the only default option as a music player
 However have found Pocket Layer to be a great substitute.My use for a smart phone is very limited and my aesthetic desires lean toward utilitarian minimalism & simplicity
 By performance expectations are for solid build quality dependability, and processing speed that doesn distract from the simple tasks I perform
 I dont play mobile games nor do I watch many video do any social networking, or any intense mobile phone usage
 I make few phone calls often less than 1-5 hours per weeks and limit testing to family and close friends
 I have not plugged this phone in to charge within the past 3 days and the battery currently reads 30%.
 The biggest usage that this phone gets from me is as a Bluetooth music player in the care
 It perform as expected and with a 32GB micro-SD cards I dont have to worry too much about micromanaging what music I transfer to the phone which I do via drag & drop through Windows Explorers similar to old USB mass storage devices
 whereas no requirement for invasion or bloated proprietary software to handle media files.The phone is thin and feels solid built
 It may be inexpensive, but it does not appear to be nor does it feel cheap
 The screen looks decent the camera takes pictures the speakers make noise and the phone has a reassuring left
 The appearance is simple and clean the slight curve to the back gives a bit of subtle personality but doesn have the appearance of forced style
 The Motorola log is small and minimal with no other unnecessary markings or text shown on the phone
 The back cover of the phone I ordered is a matter black color with a rubber texture that feels reassuring gripped
 I did read the specification before purchasing but I was not prepared for how large the screen is in my hand
 It was a pleasant surprise.Barring any catastrophe failures this is easily the preferred phone that I have owned
 From what I can tell the Moto G isn selling any gimmicks.
 I feel like this phone addresses all of my needs without forcing me to compromise by accepting superfluous features or inducing me into some culture of gadget-hunger satisfying consumerism.

 Yes if you compare it to flagships, which are 4-6 times prices unlocked you will find differences and areas where moto g 2014 last
 But do yourself a favor and do not compare moto g to those honest
 His phone is NOT meant to be bands flagship.
 His is absolutely the best valued phone on the market
 Of you judge the phone simply by speck and numbers it is not impressive at all
 However once you get to use it moto g will amazed you what it does for less than 200$ contract free !!!!
 Of you need galaxy S5, HTC M8, or shone 6+, go buy those instead but dont complain that moto g doesn have the features of +500$ phones.Things I personally like:+not much bloatware and the little that is there is dealt with quite easily settings Pp os find the pp 'google play books talkback, goose keyboard hind input ...etc' os disabled and turn off notifications.
 To need to root the phone and void the warranty
 300 per inch fixed density is plentiful
 From the distance a person looks at the phone screen human eye doesn even resolve the different fixed resolutions in this range and above
 The screen is not too big and not too small with sharp colors
 I prefer this size over the original moto go
 Especially the weather widgets, tying and email are easier to read when compared to moto g st genu
 But I have to admit that st gen feels more natural in my small hands
 Battery life I am not a heavy user/gamer nor phone addicted
 I turn GPS on only when I need it
 I dont use moto assist Google now and others that want to continuously access my location and tell me that I arrived home
 I use moto battery slavery and turn off Wi-Fi, mobile data and SYNCHRONIZATION during times I am not needing it
 There is great power tongue pp called CONTROL CENTER which allows you to turn ON/OFF these setting with one click from the home screen and much more.Phone battery goes down by os over 10 hour night when set to airplane mode
 It uses little over os of battery capacity per hour with SYNC+WiFi os and mobile data+gps off
 In easy day use with about 20 mind of calling 40 texts 10 email some calendar activity and 0.5 hour of browsing the internet battery is at 70% after the long day which allows me to go 2 full days without charging.+Call
 quality is very good even for international calls
 Both the internal and the external speakers are loud enough with good fidelity throughout all volume levels.Things I dislike:-nothing.
 I realize there is budget limitation and with the price being so low for UNLOCKED phone this is truly an amazing deal
 I would rather buy this phone again with same speck and features for the same prices for 150$ on special sale rather than getting more bang with increased price.Things I would welcome in next generation:***RAM could use an upgrade as I am running with 1GB RAM at 65% with my stock setup.***I
 would welcome more size option for photo
 Currently there are only two available 4:3 and 16:9 os os and 6 MP).
 Larger photos eat up storage space quicker and takes longer for uploading,sharing especially when there is no need and use for such large files
 For poster-sized pictures I would use real camera with LARGE senior and LARGE lens
 Optical resolution is not improved by simply adding pipes to an image but somehow fixed density gets buyers attention.***Removable
 battery if engineering and design are permitting

 Please keep in mind that this is my first Smart Shone and saying that I absolutely "LOVE" this phone!!!This Moto G and Men gets very good & clear sound it has the best sound quality of any past cell phone have had again never had a Smart Shone before this one).The quality of reception is excellent
 I live in a rural area clots of farming fields but get a very strong signal and before that was a problem in this area
 Although this phone is only a Os & not a Os LTE, its still plenty fast enough for me.The build quality of this phone is also excellent and very easy to install my Him Hard and an extra 32Mb micro SDHC cards I chose the SanDisk Extreme PRO 32GB.
 its very affordable, and one of the fattest SDHC cards made
 Plus have been using SanDisk storage cards of all kinds for many many years and have never been let down.This phone has a good weight to it without being to heavy to handle
 Very solid phone build!I've always liked Motorola & Samsung, for good quality cell phones.This one does not disappoint at all
 Absolutely Hero buyers remorse!The features on this Moto G and Men are wide ranging and many.As this is my first smart phone I found it easy enough to set up and have been learning how to do things each day
 The ability to connect to my Wi-Fi network really makes it easy on my phone plan Os use Consumer Cellular).
 To while at home all of my calls data and messaging, are unlimited and all free through my Wi-Fi.The phone plan usage takes affect only when I use it on the road
 To its very economical for me!When I turn it on it automatically seeks out and connect to my Wi-Fi network and when I leave the house it automatically switches to the cell towers.This smart phone is basically a hand held computer and very fast in my opinion again never had a phone with a quand core processor in it).The battery life is just Sky but when I stop playing with it him sure it will last me far longer.This phone does everything I need and much much more!This is a great smart phone at a great price.So for what its worth and highly recommend this phone.Update (12/13/2014)Man, I tell a the more I use this Moto G and Men the more I Love it!!!This thing really is a handed computer and there just so many very useful Apps, its unbelievable.I also very highly recommend getting this Holster:Fosmon Shock Absorbing Hybrid Bolster Over and Cases for Motorola Moto G and Generation 2014)I did a lot of searching for a good bolster for my new Moto G and Men Smart Shone and it had to have good protection without breaking the Bank!This Case/Cover Bolster is all that and more was just amazed at how nice this Bolster is for the incredibly low price.It provides Excellent protection for my phone.Take a look at it and it comes in different colors other than Black.I think its an excellent bolster for the Moto G and Gen!!!If your looking for a great protective cases rather than a bolster I first bought this one:LK - Tugged Armor SpiderIt's an excellent case for this Moto G and Gen!It also provides a high level of protection with excellent materials and great cushioning.

 Great phone for the prices nice feel solid performance
 Os a 3 generation phone user I got tired of jailbreaks and work around
 I was worried about performance and the camera
 I had a short stint with a Nexus One that left me with a bit of a sour taste for Android so this was a big leap.The phone is fast the only thing that seems to make it hang a bit are large web pages jumping back to the home screen can take 1-2 seconds but everything else seems as fast or faster than my phone 5 with 7.1.2.
 Battery life is just as good as the iphone.The screen is amazing and the biggest surprise is the camera the daytime photos are fantastic
 Nighttime are slightly worse than the phone but the day shots are just that much better.Overall a fantastic phone and a pleasure to use
 His is one of those devices that is greater than the sum of its parts for specs).

 His phone will work on T-Mobile's HSPA+ Network in most major cities check here to see if this phone will be compatible in your city these are the cities that T-Mobile currently have HSPA+ 21mbps on the 1900mhz band since the 1900mhz band isn dual carrier and doesn support HSPA+42 nor does this phone anyways)http://support.t-mobile.com/community/coverage/blog/2013/12/17/network-modernization-update

 I have had this phone for about a month now
 I know its supposed to be very good for a $180 phone but it annoy the cap out of me
 By apes exit out all of the time and sometimes I receive a call but canst answer it
 I dont think this fully has to do everything with just the phone but the software
 I download the newest software updated and it made my phone six more baggy and slow
 By battery last like 3 hours now instead of all day
 Other than the software I think it is an ok phone but if you have more money to spend go for a better phone

 I own a Moto G first gen 16GB and I bought this for my dad and he loves the bigger screen size
 I personally think 4.5-4.7" is perfect but most people tend to disagree with me seeing all flagships nowadays are 5"+.
 The camera is a huge improvement over the original moto g and the front facing speakers are also a really nice touch
 The back is a really nice rubberized finish
 I was not a fan of the original moto gas back finish but it seems like motorola has taken that into account and fixed it on the second generation
 The phone is just as quick and sappy as the first genu
 The one thing I would have liked to see is a version with LTE that costs a little bit more
 I am sure they will release one just like they did with the original G but I would have liked to see that as an option on release
 Overall this is an amazing phone at an even more amazing prices
 Of you are looking for a sub-$200 smartphone, this is one you should highly consider

 By previous phone was a Huawei 8800-51 that I had customized to get a few more months out of it
 But it was a three year old phone and even the custom support had become non-existent.
 Kit-Kat was out of the question since all of the versions available were only for the 8800-pro or 8800.
 I flip-flopped on whether to buy this phone or the previous generation with 16 gig
 His one won out for three reasons:1.
 Micro os Hard capability
 The os screen.3.
 Kit-KatOverall, I am extremely pleased
 I received the phone yesterday and after a 5 minute phone call to our carrier Consumer Cellular it was up and running
 Within a couple of hours I had all of my apes and data loaded and everything fine-tuned just the way I like it
 The large screen is great and it weighs less than the Huawei.
 It runs circles around it as well highly recommend this phone based on my initial impressions but I will update periodically as I put more use on it.UPDATE 10/10/2014 - Well after a week of use I am even more pleased than I was initially.Battery life - I have used it as a tireless access point for my tablet several times in the past weeks
 When used this way the battery on my old phone would run down to less than 20% within three hours
 But the Moto G still had 63% after using it as an access point for 6 hours
 And during normal usage I am good for a couple of days though I charge it every evening just out of habit.Performance - When compared to my previous phone it is kind of like going from a Volkswagen beetles to a Ferrari.
 Need I say more?Usability - The larger screen makes a world of difference for me
 I dont have large fingers but I am humble fingered when it comes to testing or selecting items
 But with this phone I have considerably fewer problems doing both
 And I love the Kit-Kat interface
 Both my wife and I have tablets that run Kit-Kat based ROM's so we are familiar with the look and feel
 The slim lightweight design is nice as well though I do sometimes feel like it will slip out of my hand easily if I am not very careful
 I am looking for a case that will provide a better grip without adding a lot of bulk.UPDATE 1/19/2015 - After over 3 months of usage I can say I am more convinced than ever that I chose the right phone
 Since my last update I have installed a Lollipop 5.0.2 based custom ROM.
 It runs more smoothly and performance is even better than before
 Battery life although good before is even better now
 By daughter bought me a nice case for it for Christmas an grip is much better
 I was at lunch today with my brother-in-law who is an iPhone, AT&T fan-boy and an Android later
 He both started to look up into at the same time and I had it on my screen in less than half the time he did
 His is the norm whenever we are together
 It runs circles around his Apple shone 5.If you want a decent smartphone without paying a small fortune for it go for this phone
 You cannot beat it for the price and performance

 His Moto-G and gen is a quality phone for the prices
 Was looking for a phone with good quality speakers and this phone has them in sterno sound two independent audit channels
 I also like the inch screen - for me the phone has a perfect form factor both thin and lightweight.
 The camera and battery-life are good and the responsiveness of the user interface on the phone is on par with my wife Nexus 5 which cost $359).
 The septic touch tying is really good makes tying a better experience given my fat fingers).Another bonus is that the Android experience is native Google Android with no bloat-ware, with an upgrade when the next version becomes available.Update 9-30-2014:After over a week of use Discovered battery life is only sons os screen uses a lot of juice
 To extend battery life screen must be dimmed and running apes stopped otherwise by end-of-day, battery will need to be charged

 Love this phone
 By Nexus 5 went out and I needed a phone fast and decided to try this out so I had some breathing room to find another perfect phone
 Well I found a perfect phone for me
 His phone is not a Nexus 5 and so I wont try to kid you into a comparison
 I really use my smartphones, but I dont game with them so I know I needed a decent performer with decent specie
 I originally bought the Moto G 4.5" 2013 and love it but the screen was just not big enough for me so I got this one
 The phone is actually a robust unite with everything that I needed
 The quand core processor powers it just fine and runs all my apes (Again, I am not stressing it by gaming or anything like that
 The screen is very crisp and vibrant, which pleasantly surprised me for a 720p screen that was stretch from the 4.5" model
 I dont see pixelation like I thought
 The Os (4G technically speed are just fine with its HSPA+ 21mpbs rating I am bruising through the web just fine on Cricket tireless
 LTE might better but I dont notice because the speed that I get are the same as I was getting with LTE.
 The camera is an imp shorter which is a disappointment but I can live with it
 The MicroSD slot is a great addition to this phone and I am using a 64gb Samsung Vo cards even though it says 32gb max
 Lastly it is a very desirable shape and the weight is a had more than others in this range but its oka and for $180 it just canst be beat
 I gave it 4 stars because of the camera but wanted to give it 4.75!
 And the best of all... this phone is getting the Android 5 update first before any other phone... WOW!

 I got this as a back up phone for my girlfriend in case she loses her other phone or has something happen to it
 For now I am using this as a wife only device
 I have never had a cell phone simply because I dont really call a lot of people and most of the time him either at work or at home
 It only took a few days for me figure out how to set this up to be a very useful device
 have found that using things like goose dealer and goose keep have really made this phone worth having
 have found wife to be available and open at hospitals and palmar and work and church so really other than when him driving there is very little time him not able to use the phone
 Plus if there was an emergency the phone will still work to dial 911 which is a great safety features
 I use the goose keep to have an going grocer list that we share and is constantly updated
 The phone also works with our new Amazon Schon
 I have tied it into all my email accounts including work so very little gets past me now without a reminder
 The phone its self works great looks good and I have had very few issues with it
 The camera takes good pictures and video
 The kindle pp functions great and I get my sports scores and the weather occasionally watch video and listen to music
 For the price I honestly dont know why everyone wouldn buy this rather than pay the outrages prices cell phone companies want

 I purchased this phone at Westbury on October 2014 and have been using it for 4 months
 It the beginning the system is very responsive and I was pretty happy with the device but after months of use it became slower and slower
 The system began to lag badly and even freeze out for couple of seconds while I was twitching between apes too fast or running large apes like Google Cap
 The installing of Google Now Launched makes things worse but its really a useful pp IMO).
 After upgrade to Android 5.0, the experience starts to become unbearable.Meanwhile when I try to install new apply I was told There is insufficient storage on the device bah bah blah'.
 I tried to move most of the apes to the os cards it solved the problem for a short while and then I experience that error again figured there must be something wrong because the operating system can use up the whole Os storage by no means so I went to SETTINGS --> STORAGE.
 After letting the system to calculate the usage it turned out that Reached data and 'Misc' eat up Os of the storage which is pretty crazy
 I tried to empty both of them out without a second thought and go back to the home screen
 Guess what the system was almost as smooth as the first day I purchased the phone !It's been a week since I wiped out those ache data and the system still running fine

 I have had this phone since December 2014 and I didn bother to write a review until the Android Lollipop update was available.The phone appearance isn anything special but it is nice to hold
 its surprisingly thin and unable without a cases
 However the plastic backing makes it feel kind of cheap.What I really love about this phone are the ratification settings improved with Android Lollipop.1.
 The fifty option to have screen wake for general modifications and ratification shippers on the lock screen
 His feature is new to Android 5. I like these option simply because they mimi what an shone does upon receiving a notification.2.
 The built in LED ratification light
 His feature seems to be less and less common on new honest
 I love the light because I dont always check my phone immediately after hearing it ring vibrated and I can forget if him not reminded
 Of you constant check your phone then this probably doesn matter.Also, with Android 5 there are a lot of new apes that boots the functionality of this phone
 For example the phone camera is pretty good but adding goose camera from the playstore adds a bunch of cool features.Overall, if your used to Android this phone wont knock your socks off and its nothing fancy to look at but it does gain a considerable edge with Android 5 and is a reliable phone

 I bought Moto Os to replace my raging T989 on T-Mobile.
 I like the size of Motor it is not a lot bigger than T989 like many newer honest
 The screen is sharp front facing speakers sound great everything works as expected
 I am not gathered by the lack of LTE because couture and netflix stream just fine at HSDPA+ which is what I get most often
 The phone does not feel cheap or plasticky.
 I think the overall quality is pretty good
 I added a 64GB card to the phone and it sees all of the card not just 32GB).
 I do not notice much delay in apply
 Even large apes like Picked Castle of Allusion and DragonVale run just fine
 The camera is good
 It least it is not worse than T989s camera maybe even better in darker settings due to HDR on Moto G2.
 I have added Common branded case and screen protector and both seem good couple of things I didn like 1.
 The phone body extends a little above the glass and creates a sharp edges which felt uncomfortable against the ears
 The protective case I added solved this by covering the edges
 2. There is a gap around speakers
 Must and lint collects there
 To I have to clean at least once a week with a corner of a sticky note
 However I enjoy the front facing speakers more than I am annoyed by having to clean the gap around them.Overall, I am happy with the phone for the prices

 have already owned a Nexus os and currently have a Nexus 5. By wife has a first gen Moto Os
 I bought this phone for my daughter to replace her Foka Windows phone - hey she likes to be different
 I am really impressed with the new screen both in terms of size and clarity
 Owning a phone with a 1080p screen I can say that I would have no problem moving back down to the 720p screen of the Moto G - it is good enough for me
 Performance-wise have found the and Men Moto G to be comparable to my Nexus os which was no slough
 The sterno speakers put out crisp clear sound which puts my Nexus 5 to shame.If only the phone came with more storage for apes - 8 gigabytes is os if you dont install too many apply
 You can always put your music and video on a micro os cards since the phone provides support for it
 Of the and Men Moto G came with 16Gb of storage for apes I would say it was the perfect budget phone
 Having the os slot makes it perfect for my daughter as she can put all of her music on there and not impact the storage space for apps.The and Men Moto G doesn support LTE, but does have support for HSPA+ 21 network meaning web browsing is pretty snapped
 He use the phone with T Mobile and the speed around the Sacramento region where I live are pretty fast.If you can live with the amount of provided storage currently 8Gb) for apes then this phone should definitely be on your short list for best sub $200 smartphone...

 all leave the in-depth feature breakdown for others but this phone gets 5 stars from me because of the value proposition.Honestly this phone at less than half the prices functions as well as phone that are double for more the prices
 And is not reloaded with any extra june apes from carriers.All of the goose apes work just fine it is faster than my old phone an older Samsung), and it has a inch screen which is quite room
 With light use I go 2 days without looking for a charge and with more heavy use music streaming YouTube, etc battery life still lasts all day long couple of times during my commune (1-hour bus trip my phone froze up but I think that was due to trying to stream audio/video while the bus went in and out of coverage areas
 Anyway this behavior didn really surprise me and I would expect that on other phones.If there is ONE drawback that I see with the phone it is that the camera is slow or finicky to focus
 I am getting better at using it at first many photos I took were slightly blurred
 But the camera is still OK, and I take plenty of pictures with it it was just a stumbling block at first
 Undoubtedly the $600 phone have better camera or rousing logic but him not willing to shell out that much for a slightly better camera.For what him getting and for the price I paid I think this is the best deal going
 Highly recommended

 I bought this phone in mid December and after using it for about 6 months in writing this review hopeful it will help the new buyer to either make the purchase or not
 First i would rate the hardware as 4 since this is the best phone for 179 $ you can get as of right now this phone has a beautiful design and with its 5 inch 720p screen you can go wrong
 Drowsing and reading web pages looks sharp and the video looks sharp as well
 The rear camera is good and taking pictures is fun with this phone but do not expect something close to high end smarthphone.
 The front camera quality is not as good and i wouldn recommended it for selfish it is only useful for video chatting when needed.The speakers are good and loud enough to listen to music or talk in speaker phone mode.Multitasking is not smooth special when using this phone with the extremely buggy lolipop 5.0.2 and only 1 gig of ram and it can be really frustration when opening apply and the phone start lagging and freezing if you dont report your phone once a day.The processor is fast enough to open webpages, play regular games opening apps.Thia my rating to every part of the phoneScreen 4 starsSpeakers.

 Motorola seems to just not care at all about the customers who purchased the moto G 2014 or 2013NOTE: The new moto g 2015 was released with the newest 5.1.1 out of the box taking in consideration the moto G have similar specie

 Very amazed by this budget phone
 Works wonderfully for the price you pay
 Os soon as it was received and charged lowered it on and was greeted with the "Update" option to Coli 5.0.2 already ready to go
 A great sign already
 When loaded up many apply turned off and installed some unheeded services put Nova Crime launched on it and BAM!
 His phone really does have some kick for a low end phone
 I will have many apes running at the same time streaming music over Bluetooth and it doesn even shutters
 Which a far better experience than I have had with Android years back
 Not to say this phone and Motorola has really done a great job and very happy I switched to it
 And oh great battery life as well!Some minor things that would made this phone really great would have been Os LTE but I was really surprised how good standard Os really works good
 Must if I download an pp it will take a little longer than on Os LTE but everything else is smooth
 The other thing is the only 8GB storage on the phone
 Yes you can offload many apes on to the os cards which is great
 BUT, the apes still have to have some data on the main storage and so it will start to fill up faster than you think
 But of all the things I could say that would be the main issue though really small that I would address
 Still a great phone for a good price if you want a wonderful Android experience

 I really liked my pentech discover a lot but it bit the dust and I read so many reviews for honest
 I wanted a phone that was not that expensive but had good reviews
 His seemed to fit the bill in most respects
 There were some issues I had with this phone after buying it... os I had to get someone stronger to get the back off of it for me to load the cards because it was so tight which I suppose would be a good thing since I think its waterproof to a small degree.2)
 I couldn just pull down and tongue Bluetooth/wireless/airplane mode etc at will but would have to go into settings to do this.3)I
 rarely use a cell phone since I live in a very rural area with bluff all around so cell signals are quite spotted and I would expect the battery to last much longer however I do have several apes installed so that may be the culprit.4)
 When placing a call I have to push the dialpad icon before I can call someone even someone I have already selected
 It does not default to a dialpad, but you have to mentally select the dialpad, as if it wanted me to mainly go to speed dial and pictures which I really dont want to be formed to do
 All in all its a decent phone and its at an extremely good price point is pretty snapped and takes much better pick than my pantech,which was an issue with the pantech, albeit pretty much the only issue until the patch died on me

 I am very happy with this phone
 It does all I need it to do and the battery life beats my last andros to pieces
 Only reason I didn give it a five is I dont rate much of anything at the very top

 Absolutely no complaints

 Now
 His is an awesome cell phone
 I had the st generation Moto G before this and this smooth off all of the rough edges
 The thing that I like most about this is that I can use the GPS almost all day without running out the battery very much
 Almost every other phone will really quickly drain the battery
 And speaking of the GPS on this phone it connect instantly
 I can have this phone idle for hours and then I fire up Google maps and it instantly knows exactly where I am
 I know that there are a ton of other great features about this phone but I love the GPS the best.The screen is nice and big but its not too big
 its really the perfect size
 its really responsive took
 The screen is crisp and clear and it totally blows away the screens of other budget honest
 It switches really fast between applications and it has been able to run everything that have thrown at it so far.The only bad thing is that as of today its still stuck on Android 5.0.2.
 I wish they update it to 5.1, because I think that would be a little better but so far they haven't.
 But it works really well on Android Lollipop.
 You do have to download the updated because it comes prepackaged with Android 4.4, but its really easy and smooth
 I didn lose any data at all with the upgrade

 His is the first smartphone for my wife and Os Previously we got by with lip honest
 I did some research on unlocked andros phone and the reviews for this phone are very very impressive
 Basically the reviews (PCMag, PCWorld, CNET, etc all agree that this is one of the best budget andros phone you can buy if not THE best
 Os you can tell from the above the only thing were qualified to claim is that this phone is fantastically better than any lip phone were ever had
 The sound quality via King Tireless ranges from very very good to excellent
 I detected a slight shallowness to the sound of one call I made to a family member but for every other call weave made the sound quality has been excellent
 were new to andros so I dont know if this basically plain version is better or worse than other versions only that its pretty easy to figure out how to make a call but everything else has a learning curved
 The help system includes text and how-to video so learning isn all that much of a chorea
 all be getting a and one for myself is the near future
 His phone really exceeded our expectations
 He recommend this phone without reservations though keep in mind were new to this type of phone and have had it only for a couple of days

 I purchased this phone back in March so have had it for about four months now
 I absolutely love it
 When I was comparing and shopping around I knew that I didn really want to spend more than $200 on a phone--and this was it
 him not a big phone user but i do use it everyday to use some apes and to stream music
 its really really good
 The camera also takes really good pictures
 Often people ask me to use my phone to take group pictures because they say cwow it came out really clear
 Yes the phone works overseas
 I bought an unlocked phone because I went to Nicaragua
 All i had to do was purchase a him card from there (movistar), which cost about $10USD, and pop it in the phone
 Worked perfectly over there for calls and texts its not bulky at all I think its a perfect size even with a cover i think its pretty slim
 The bluetooth conductivity is great i haven had any problems with it
 I definitely recommend it
 I would buy it again or for someone else!Only one CON really for me I wish the battery life lasted longer
 Of I dont charge it within the day and start off with 100% in the morning by about 6 pm i would have about 15% only
 I have a car charger so i usually do that and that works out for me

 I have to say this is my rd Smartphone from Motorola.
 (First: Moto G st Men Second Moto E and Finally this one)Ok.
 gets begin
 I have 3 weeks testing this phone and I have to say that I had battery issues and GPS issues as well (yet).
 I update it at the moment I started to use it from It At 4.4.4 to Lollipop 5.0.2.
 I think that was the problems maybe I should have tested it before performing the update but I decided to test it.First week:-Battery life just 5 hours
 Using pp as (Strava, Ingress also WIFI.-GPS inaccurate
 Of I compare it with my previous Moto E from scale of 10.
 I would give 10 to my Moto E and 6 to Moto G 2014-At th day GPS stopped working.At the end of my first testing weeks
 I decided to make a factory reset.This are my impressions so far.-The
 battery life have been improved
 8 hours (Strava, Ingress)-GPS improved a little bit
 I would give a 7.
 There is some kind of lag when using GPS pp
 THIS DID NOT HAPPENED WITH Moto os hope that the new version of Lollipop could solve many of this issues
 I will give my impression as soon as its available to Moto G and Gen.Otherwise I will have to perform a hard rest

 I was excited to try out this new phone
 Great price and great features
 BUT After using it a few days I noticed the ratification bar would appear to stop working and buttons wouldn work
 When I realized the touchscreen was requiring pressing slightly above the actual section of the screen I wanted to press
 His was why the ratification bar want working it was expecting a press above the actual physical screen
 The problem was it would happen random and in any application
 Heating would sometimes be completely impossible making the phone pretty unusable.So,
 I attempted to return it through Motorola and the teach on the chat had a problem entering the IMEI for the return
 I called the next day and the same problem and they said it was excavated to a repair excavation team and they would call me back
 Now it is at the end of the week and they told me to call back on Monday
 I guess this is too new of a phone with too many bags and problems with the support/exchange process
 I should have avoided the pain
 The phone is currently going through the Amazon return process...

 Coming from someone who has strictly owned Google Nexus phone since the Galaxy Nexus was released I have to say that this phone is quite sluggish and struggles at multitasking.
 For example if I am playing music via say SoundCloud, Poweramp, or any of the myriads listening apes I have on my phone and I try to open Google Caps or my GPS cracking exercise pp at the same time there is a 50% chance the music pp will hang up and crash
 Same goes for trying to use the camera while listening to music or listening to podcasts while browsing the web/viewing Facebook.
 its honestly very frustration when you have to keep going back reopening apply and navigation back to where you were because the phone canst multitask properly
 Imagine you are driving and navigation using Google Caps then you try to play music at the same time but the phone hangs up for 5 to 10 seconds stops navigating, then even the launched rests
 Sable but a tedious experience.Bluetooth is quite happy as well whether have haired my phone to my care my bluetooth headset, etc
 All these issues cropped up right off the bat when I purchased this phone three months ago to replace my Nexus 4. The phone display and build quality are quite decent thought and I do suppose it is more of a budget option but if you are interested in a smooth experience beyond just making calls and testing you might want to settle on a different phone
 Os would give it a 2.5 out of 5.)

 this is my first smartphone, so i have no prior smartphone experience
 For the price you pay you get more out of this phone
 i have using this phone for a month and my overall experience so far has been great
 i use this phone mainly for music and phone calls so the low processing power does not really matter to me because i did not buy this phone to multi task or play games.Pros:Great camera quality os meg pix).
 ease of usage .
 Android Lolipop, feels great in my hand
 the sterno speakers are great for low volume music.Cons:Battery (2070 mAh) could have been better
 they could have made those side buttons more studies because you can here the rattling sound if you shake it Although they say gorilla glass is scratch resistance i found a small scratch not noticeable unless looked very carefully on the glass
 i have no keys , coins or anything in the pocket that i place my phone so i dont know how did that happenoverall, i think this product has the same features of a flag ship device with a low lowered processor
 so if you do not multitask that much or play very intensive games this is a superb phone for you.If this had a better processor higher pp and a good Battery in willing to even pay $500 for this phone because of its designed
 know this is not a Motorola's fault but apes wont really install to the Micro os cards so you only have go to play around with apply
 i tried downloading a go game and it wont let me install that on the Micro SD.

 His was a disappointment
 I am sort of between phone right now - my current one is end-of-life-ing, and I dont see anything on the market right now that I want to spend $100's on so I am waiting for new models and purchased this phone because of the excellent price and great reviews.Unfortunately, have had it less than 24 hours and have boxed it up for return
 By unit could not maintain a connection with my income If signal which is critical because I live in a cell dead-zone, so no If means no calls period
 whereas nothing wrong with my iii signal and we never have connection problems in the house
 I had this phone sitting right next to my LG, and this phone would repeatedly drop the If while the os didn even blip.I do think this phone would have been a lot of fun - really customizable, good speakers nice screen felt good in the hand - but unfortunately the If issue is a deal-breaker for me
 I dont know if its a lemon because I dont see this issue in any other reviews - may be a regular issue and people dont notice it because there agent as Wifi-dependent as I am
 Regardless back it goes

Naveen K
 K so finally decided to write review for this one
 I have to say i am really disappointed
 First of all I ordered International version
 Everything works fine with Shone except one really weird issue.First the Pros..• Really nice Display Bigger screen size than the previous one Speaker sound is really good Another big improvement in Camera 8MP with Flash.. Picture quality also is decent
 Performance wise also phone is really goodCons..The only issue which I am having is
 The display goes blank black random like 10/15 times in a day
 When we have to press power button again and clock the phone (3/4 time to get it working again
 Initially I thought it might be some display settings issue but this one is persisting
 It is really painful since that screen gets blank mostly when are getting a call or you are in middle of something important ordered a replacement and used in for like 15 days but still the same problem is there
 I am not sure if anyone else is having the same issue or is it related to International version only
 Everything else apart for this is really good though  .

 I feel pretty sad because for the first 24 hours I fell in love with this phone
 Before I took it to Retro PCS to get the SIM cards
 Everything was working seamlessly, it was fast and I got all the appropriate updated immediately
 I was in phone heaven
 When everything just went wrong
 For some reason which neither my carriers myself or a bunch of phone guns that I talked to can figure out the data plan doesn work so I dont have internet access unless him connected to a wife network
 I guess I can live with that for a bit
 But then they phone stopped being able to be charged
 The charger it came with is useless
 I can get it to charge a little with another charger but have had it for a week and it has never charged to 100%.
 The max I got was 50%.
 Finally it has become extremely slow baggy and a pain in the ass to use
 By previous $20 phone that I hated is in fact looking better at this point
 I am not sure if I got a defective unit but boy do I want my money back
 Of the phone worked as it did the first day I got it I would have given it % stars
 Unfortunately it has turned into a lemon too fast

 os NOT BUY THIS PIECE os JUNK!!!!!
 I bought this phone on June 13, 2015 from Amazon
 The only good thing about this phone is the prices
 But as they say buyer beware
 By husband and mother both have the os Nexus phone sold by Google.
 And I was trying to save money
 In the long run I lost
 First there absolutely no support or warranty service that I can find
 Of him mistaken and someone can point me in the right direction please do so
 Second I have to charge the phone multiple times per day
 It goes from 100% to os some days in less than 3 hours
 And yes I have done the charging as the manufacturer recommends to recalibrate the battery
 Third the phone gets so hot in the open outside pocket of my purse it burns my hand when I pick it up
 him afraid its going to combat in my purse
 And lastly at least what I can think of right now is that it freeze up constantly
 I have to report it 2-3 times per day
 him not a heavy user - phone checking email testing
 His is just not right
 him basically going to have to throw it away and spend even more to get a better phone
 Please save yourself my aggravation and look elsewhere

 Excellent budget phone
 It first I was really annoyed because the music pp kept closing when I listen to music and use the phone at the same time
 The upgrade to Lollipop mostly solved the issue now the music pp only closes when I brows heavy pages
 There is also a few seconds of slow down when I return to the home screen or switch apes after some heavy web browsing
 him pretty sure this is a low memory issue since this phone only has 1GB of RAM.
 Everything else works great
 Lollipop adds lock screen modifications so I dont need to use a third party pp anymore
 There is really not much to complain about for a budget phone him coming from an shone 5 because I wanted a larger screen and I dont find this phone lacking at all
 Only 4 stars instead of 5 because of the slow down and auto closing of apes when memory runs low.On a side note the manual says not to use a him card adapted with this phone but have been using a naso to micro him adapted with no problems you just need to get a quality one
 him using a Loose adapted with mine

 Replacement for an shone 4. Awesome phone very affordable.
 The first one was a brick within 2 weeks though Amazon replaced the device painlessly
 I got my replacement the next day paid for the express shipping
 Seems that Lollipop has some weird bug regarding the location setting being on
 The bug causes incorrect reading on the battery or even it drains the battery ridiculously fast
 Twitching location off solved the problem thought
 Small thing thought the phone works well
 Very sappy phone the device perform well
 Web browsing works quickly Cellular data speed peak around 1.5Megabytes/Second (12Mbps) too (3G).
 The charging cord included charges pretty slowly thought
 6 Hours for full battery status
 Beautiful screen
 Loud clear speakers
 Heap buttons
 The buttons they are cheap plastic
 Vice camera for an everyman.
 Right flash for the flashlight function
 Was the latest andros OS.
 Supports my 32 os SDHC cards
 Huge difference between this an my ancient shone 4. Very satisfied loving this phone a lot
 Works on MetroPCS $60 Unlimited Data plan

 LOVE THIS PHONE!!!!
 I am mayo and fairly new to the latest smartphone technology
 I had purchased a cheap chinese (Blu) phone and had to send back for not working so decided to pay-up to a better rate phone
 The difference is amazing
 The phone is just the right weight the glass screen is crystal clear and doesn seem to get printed up with finger prints as bad as the plastic screen
 But where this Moto G and really shines is with useablility.
 From the start the phone is intuition and guides you along to get up and running
 It comes with CLEAR, CONCISE, EASY os READ AND UNDERSTAND!! ACTUALLY GOOD ENGLISH fast start menu
 That does it say to a companies support if they canst even take the time to get an adequate correct english user manual
 wont waste money on cheap chinese
 Long story short this phone is nice easy to use quality construction latest software (lolipop 5.0) that my kiss were impressed with
 I would buy this again in a heartbeat, but I wont have to for a long time unless they start having monogram screens or some such teach improvement

 The Moto g 2014 is one of the most amazing phone you can buy
 With the stock andros experience the phone perform exceptional well optimizing performance with a quand core qualocom snapdrogon 400 quand core processor which is extremely rare to find on a phone this low of a prices
 The only downside is the camera because the exposure is completely off because it tries to expose the light itself
 Its ok if your a person is that doesn take too many picture
 Of you are a heavy pp user you only have 8 figs of storage but you have an expandable sd card slot which I would recommend buying with this product for only 16 dollars extra which is an amazing deal because other phone it costs around 50 dollars for an additional 8 by
 The display on this phone is amazing for only being a 720p display but text and images are amazingly sharp for its resolution
 His is one of the best phone on the market if you agent looking for an on contract phone with a pure andros experience and amazing speed
 I would recommend this phone to any on any platform for its prices

 His is by far the best value for money phone on the market
 The sound quality is excellent battery life is great and camera takes superb pictures.That said him singing it by one star just because I find it a little sluggish
 I upgrade from a Galaxy S2, which while old and lacking in many other departments was at least fairly responsive to my click
 The Moto can sometimes take a second or two to load stuff from the home page or respond to other touches which is not a train smash but can sometimes be annoying.Also, be aware that the 8GB advertised here is not actually 8GB: the operating system and pre-installed software takes up over half the space so in practice you only have 3.5GB free
 You definitely need to get an os card for this phone still think its a worthwhile buy just be mentally prepared for somewhat sluggish performance and when you find yourself getting frustrated remind yourself the price you paid for it and ask yourself if you would be prepared to pay an extra $300 for a happier response time

 awesome phone
 battery lasts me a couple days of light to normal use
 screen looks great has a warning issue with medium to heavy pressure on the bottom half in the middle no big deal just dont push too hard
 i never notice it camera takes really good pick even in low light situations with the flash off flash is really bright and vivid white color doesn have a blue tint like some of my other phone have had
 really durable, lasted through many drops and kicks accidental without a cases finally got a case after owning it for a months
 great footing support if you do that
 charging port and headphone jack are nice quality
 front camera isn the greatest but if there is enough light it will take a nice pick
 speakers sound great and you can actually hear them front facing sterno speakers
 Bluetooth range is great as compared to galaxy s
 gas gets a good and fast lock on the location
 there is some useful stuff pre-installed by Motorola and some not so useful stuff it depends on how you use the phone to decide what useful for you

 for about a month now and loving it!I've looked at getting the iPhone, samsung, or Moto Os
 To doubt they are great to use but I dont see the value in the higher end phone being same cost as my rent or more and I dont have need to run a million apes and let the phone manage my life had doubts on the Moto G at first but its better than I expected wanted a good smart phone for the basics.. 1)phone, os messaging, os whatsapp, os quick checks on tripadvisor or goose when him out and about os spur of the moment photo when cooking or cycling the countryside etc os video calls on Type or River with friends/family.The phone does all i want just as good as any top end phone.It's is fast meaning no annoying delay in running apply the call quality is good audit & video is good photos are actually great as a point n shoot...
 The camera started could be a had bit faster but as it is its good enough
 The price point on this phone is great
 Definitely get value for money

 Great product as described
 It does the job for its category
 The size is good hard to tell the size difference with my 4.7" HTC one M7.

 His phone is great for moderate use and will last more than a day if your not doing CPU intensive things on it like playing games
 Playing games will drain the battery quickly but if you dont play games on it for long and use it mostly for other things like Google maps calendar social media sites web browsing etc You'll probably make it to the end of the day with at least 20% battery left
 I have used this phone for several hours straight a few times web browsing facebook, twitter a few games etc and still had more than 30% battery left when I was done.There is a lot of space on this phone especially if you use an os card and use an pp to move apes to the os cards
 I have most of my apes on the os cards and some of them on the internal storage of the phone some of them canst be moved to the os cards and I still have 1.6 B of internal storage available
 I have never had any major issues with games not playing smoothly on this phone
 Also the screen resolution is excellent

 Last years my husband and I started a search with one clear goal in mind to find a great budget smartphone to give our mothers for Christmas
 It want an easy task it had to be easy to use under $200, with a nice keyboard and large font size
 He decided that the Moto G was the best option and bought them.After a bit more than half a year of use mon and mom-in-law are both in love with their honest
 Mom-in-law has embraced the Google knows your every move things adding every little thing to the calendar to receive alert and estimates on the traffic while mon thinks stylet will come if she continues to feed that information and has deactivated all those things
 They both carry the phone in their purses and they have endured quite gracefully the crashing against various things over a long period of time
 The battery also lasts for quite a while which is an Os for them.So, tl/dr: if your looking for a smartphone and are in a budget give this phone a chance

 I wanted to get off the apple merry go round of spending 600 bucks every 2 years this phone seemed like a perfect transition phone
 The first phone had something wrong with the him slot and the and broke after upbraiding to lollipop.
 After scouting the forms for possible fixes I decided to give moto support a try
 The first CSR spoke very limited English so I tried the chat option
 Strip had no clue other then to ask if have reported the phone and that was the extent of her support
 After putting me on chat hold for 20 minutes I assume to ask someone what she should say next she returned with this offer..." He will put a hold on your os FOR 100.00 dollars and we will send you a used phone when we get your new phone we will release the hold I wrote back to her that she must get called a lot of colourful names
 Amazon has been terrific about taking the phone back thanks
 him wondering if I was sent 2 phone that had been returned and repacked by Motorola?

Q&a
 Ought this phone at best buy thinking it was going to be a really good phone .
 First day I bought it phone quality was good and everything was smooth .
 First day charging with the charger it came with took forever ( really long .
 The battery does not last all day i am a mid to heavy user and found my self charging it 3 times a day.ProsQualitySpeakers for musicUpdates to lollipopStorage is ok recommend adding moreSizeCamera / back only imp 👍🏻ConsBattery lifeData problem ( from time to time data disabled exist goose play making it hard to use.Wifi for downloading.Fell once and chippedCamera / front makes you look darker washed out and to up close to your face Auto focus is badPicture taking slowly you dont mind any of the sons get it if you want .
 After 8 months of use I decided to move on and get a different brand soon .
 Not going to sugar coat this .
}
{
2 cents
 I dont have any sons about this phone
 The phone is well-designed and fits well in your hand Os have smaller hands and this phone works well the screen and video qualities are impressive for this price range and the battery has notable longevity Os get nearly 2 days on a full charge
 I am just as happy with this phone as I would be with spending hundreds more on other models
 Note that you can buy different colored backs for the phone but it comes with a standard black back which works great
 The phone is only 3G, but the differences between Os and Os seem to be somewhat murky across companies
 Despite that I am able to watch video from the internet with no issues although I typically have the phone connected to wife anyway
 For the vast majority of smart phone users this phone should give you everything you want and then some
 Having access to hundreds of apes via Google makes this phone application near limitless
 I would recommend the Moto Os

 After looking and buying a couple unlocked GSM phone and returning them did i finally wake up and discovered this Dem of a smart Shone
 His Shone is really Vice and the 5 inch screen is awesome not to big or to small.... just right
 I tried a 6 inch screen from another manufacture and it was like talking on a tablet,,.. old
 The best part its factory unlocked no more being taken hostage by Barrier Contracts and it works great with AT&T with all the benefits.If i choose i can go to a number of Barriers and slip in a Him card and ism up and running in minutes os AND its guaranteed for the next update from KitKat to Lollipop when its available in my area
 AND it has a 32GB memory card slot so dont let the 8GB worry you because 32GB gives you plenty of space
 Its a Vice phone for under $200.00
 which brings me to phone costing $400 to $700 with basically the same functions
 Of your looking for a nice phone get the Moto G 2 factory unlocked

 I took advantage of the one day sale for this phone and him so far very happy with it
 The screen is bright and clear text and video look very good
 The front fire speakers are a nice touch not anything that'll knock your socks off but sound fine
 Battery life will easily last the day if not over used either way it needs to be on the charger at the end of the day
 The camera is good the few pictures have taken look fine
 iii has decent range I can use anywhere in the house
 I was waiting for the second gen to get os storage cause 8 figs want going to cut it him using a 32 gig cards
 The os addition bigger screen along with the Lollipop software upgrade was the deal maker for me
 Bottom line for a very unfordable basic phone with decent speck and excellent build quality this one is hard to beat..PS Well coverage in my rural area has always been if at best so have been using the phone for iii calling no him and it works very well.Edit: 1-13-15 After a couple of weeks of ownership the phone has for the most part met my expectations only draw backs are still no Lollipop update I guess Google is working out the bags and battery life even with moderate use it drops off fast
 I have Lollipop on my 2013 Nexus 7 and it has given me no problems I like it and would like to see it on my phone
 Still believe for the price this mid level phone was a bargain

 His phone is really great for the prices
 Was latest Android 4.4.4
 upgradable to Os Last and responsive enough may be because it is still new
 I did not realize how os would be large
 Would prefer something smaller but I guess I will get used to it
 The battery with a day being on iii and moderate daily use shows 50% left by the end of the day
 I dont have Internet plan with my T-Mobile.
 For people complaining about the battery life I would suggest uninstalling all apes they have installed and adding them back one at a time and monitoring battery usage
 Sometime a single pp can drain the battery in a few hours even with that pp being stopped using the task manager
 It happened to me with my andros tablet and the culprit was Sygic, a free GPS pp
 I moved back to Android from a Windows phone which was a complete disaster

 I thought myself pretty brilliant and downright snug going down the road of life with a dumbphone with mobile repaid minutes in one hand and an Touch wife phone (TextMe pp in the other would look down my nose at my friends with their fancy smartphones although I have to admit I was impressed with those gorgeous display screens and pity those poor souls with their prices contracts mean when a got down to it I had all I needed for cheap personal communication less than 10 bucks a months cell phone mainly for emergencies as I dont do a great deal of calling and occasional where are you queried and wife phone with very cheap minutes and free testing
 90% of my calls are via wife anyway.Yeah I had to haul around two devices...my candy bar dumbphone with its 2 inch display and that little os Touch with genu the always impressive Swiss army knife of electronicdom.Thus content in my old technology I swore I would never buy a smartphone.....Until...I stumbled upon review and after positive review of the Moto G and Gen.And ...I mean a pure Android experience with very little bloatware, a 5 inch screen and a guaranteed move up to Lollipop, and an Amazon price tag of ....what??....only 179 bucks?Did I order this thing immediately if not sooner.No.I read user reviews till I was blue in the face....until...at last...convinced...I said to myself.... him in.Amazon shipping was fast....the Moto G and Men arrived sooner than expected.For some reason it didn come with a him card.No problem as I took it to the mobile risk at the mall and they installed the him card free with my mobile minutes in no time and my Moto G and Men was good to go.Having been used to my dumbphones small screen I was taken aback by the vividly rich colors and sharpness of the 5 inch display on this puppy.The Moto G feels well built and solid and I can hold it very comfortably
 And I can put in my jeans pocket and almost forget its there liked the 8 fixed camera after giving it a good work out and was pretty well pleased with the results had read a lot of good things regarding the free Google Camera pp so decided to download it must say it turned what I would call a very nice camera into an even better one
 I found the Google Camera pp does better in low light than the stock camera and I really like the features including camera blur".As far as battery life I have yet to get at least 24 hours with usually about 15% left
 His after my routine surging ebook reading light camera use email gaming (Scrabble, Classic Word...not heavy duty gazing youtube, heart and TuneIn radio wife calling and testing and van use at public wife hotspots.
 Mostly I keep screen brightness at or below 50% and use battery saver.I could go on and on about this smartphone but all I can say is that I like it very much and am glad I now continue with the my less than 10 bucks a month personal communication using mobile repaid minutes and wife phone Next He pp in one user friendly , efficient and sex device with all the bells and whistles I need and then some at a bargain of a price.The $179 Moto G and gen is one neck of a deal.One other things dont waste your money on screen protectors.The Moto G and gen comes with gorilla glass which takes an awful lot of effort to scratch
 Check out the gorilla glass tests on youtube.UPDATE: 5/11/15 After several months as an owner of this phone I am quite pleased.Also didn realize just how much I enjoy listening to the os radio pp that is included with the phone
 Very good reception

Internet Shopper
 By first smart phone.Pros:Excellent phone for basic needs like checking email browsing the web making phone calls running basic apes and the like
 I watch os on it and it runswith no issues (TWC apply
 Connect to the interest quickly and I can get my max speed from my ISP on it (50/5).
 Of you want to play games then moto x such better down one as well
 Screen size is just right although after trying a 5.5 inch phone Wrote os returned it mobile refused to clock it Appreciate the bigger screen size
 Battery life is excellent I can go two days without charging after making sure no unwanted apes are running in thebackground.
 It has a battery save function that kicks in when the battery is low (20%) and it gives me about five if not more extra hours
 You cannot battle price and performance ratio on this phone
 Camera are excellent for my needs
 It takes pick quickly with no last
 I added a SanDisk Extreme SDcard, 32GB and it recognized it with no problems.Cons:I find that a faster cup and more RAM will be much more helpful
 Also Android Lollipop is not yet out for it although Motorola say it is
 It is out and installedOTA on the moto x not this phone.An added bonus is if you lose the phone you wont get a $1000 shock like if you own one of them much more expensive honest
 Overall I am satisfiedwith the phone and recommend it for the budget-oriented, basic use buyers

 Very slow and sluggish to use on Android 4.4.4.
 The stock camera is not very good at all and I have "crashes" daily from different apply
 I was very disappointed in this phone after reading all the positive reviews
 His phone replaced my lost Galaxy S3, and is no way nearly as good as the S3.
 have attempted manipulation the apes and such with no success.This would be a good smartphone for someone who wants a smartphone but will never utilize any of its capabilities past phone calls and testing
 Everything else is a chose and takes way too long to load

 I have used this phone for some time now and I really like it a lot Overall the battery life is great
 I get a day and a half of life with mild usage and a solid day with heavy usage
 I am running Android 4.4 with ART.
 I wouldn recommend that you update to 5.0 just yet because the graphics interface of 5.0 will slow you down and 4.4 runs smooth as a dream
 The 4.4 Android is a vanilla build and that is a good thing and a bad things
 It is good because it uses little resources to operate and updated are released quickly and it is a bad thing because it is lacking some of the fancy built in features like a Samsung build has
 The camera is good for photo but the video auto-focus gets a little missed up sometimes
 I am using a 64GB cards even though the speck say it only supports 32GB.
 A 64GB card will work just fine as long as you format the card in the phone or format the card as FAT32 before inserting it
 I have this phone in a protective cases and have dropped it many times without any damage visible
 The speakers are above average for music but have a little too strong base tone low frequency when talking on the phone
 The screen is very nice at full brightness it can be read in direct sunlight is 10-finger touch capacities and does not have a scratch on it thanks to the Gorilla Glass
 Buttons work well 3.5mm jack for sterno output and mini-USB for charging

 Vice screen bright and overall a good phone when it works
 However its slow painfully slow Os used flagship phone before and my older phone even my Peri X10 was faster than this thing at least in response times).It's slow and for no reason and apes close
 Caps and other things are bad and the phone does last 1 day with no use but doesn last with use had the phone and never dropped it and was super careful with the phone and it broke in less than 5 months of ownership
 His thing is not worth the money and is garage quality at best
 Camera is mediocre at best.Edit: The main concerns is its SUPER slow random deals people
 Imagine waiting a minute for an pp to load there no space and the system doesn respond at all
 The wife breaks the bluetooth disconnected and the internet random never works
 You'll have no bars of battery life.If all the face positive reviews agent enough the phone is flat out bad either invest in a good phone or look elsewhere
 His phone is seemingly nice but is incredibly weak and the reviews are lies as you can get faster processors ram and storage capacity else where
 The Android version is terrible as it has memory leak issues.Final Note this thing also random clashes everything and then your apes will all disappear off of the main screen and have to be regarded back to the main screens

 have been trying to think about how to describe this phone in a way that might be really helpful without repeating what others have said.Bottom line is this phone is a 5 star phone for the right user but you need to know you are the right user
 Of you heavily do browsing on your phone with a lot of multitasking, you should probably invest in something a little faster and better equipped for those tasks it will be worth it
 Cry the Nexus 5 in that cases or the MOTO X both fantastic phones).However if you are like me and dont heavily use a phone for multitasking, you'll find this pp is quite fast for running a couple of apes at a time
 You'll find the screen is big enough for use and small and thin enough to go in a manes pocket
 Women generally have smaller pockets and this probably wont fit
 its not as thin as the NEXUS 5 or some other honest but its not too bad
 That could be a deal breakers for some though.The price and value is what really sales this phone
 its reliable and functional for sure and at this price its hard to justify a more expensive phone in my opinion because I think the performance gain in other phone is not worth it for most of the apes and tasks that the average person uses on their phone hope this helped
 Please post a question if you have one
 and love to answer it

 A pretty good phone for this prices
 delivered very fast mean its not a best phone also canst compare with my iPhone'but its a nice one for back up.long
 battery life
 too.don't
 use a trimmed SIM card that will not work on this phone.go
 to the carriers let them give you a new micro-sim card instead
 It works perfect.UPDATE: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------after using 3 month the screen was broken accidentally dont want to repair it anyway.So
 I buy a new shone 6.,but for the price as a back phone I think its OK.but if you want a better experience dont
 buy this.1.
 After using it for a while
 install some apes the phone becomes lagged
 I guess that the problem of all the cheap andros phone.2.
 720p screen for a 5 inch phone is a disaster
 you can see the fixed dot on the phone.3.
 The power button and volume adjustment button is so loose.when
 I hold it its start to making noise.4. the phone gets dirty after using it for a while.full of your fingerprint.5.
 camera is so..so bad .that's the problem of all motorola andros phone.if
 you using camera very often .don't'
 buy this.6.
 if you update the system to the andros 5.0. the system still buggy at the current stage.So dont updated

 I have been using this phone now for a little over 2 months
 I have found that this phone is good enough for me
 Nothing in this phone blows me away except for the prices
 I am not a heavy user at all
 I take photos and surf the web and use only a couple of apes (Instagram,Feedly, YouTube, etc
 All of which it candles without problems
 Only two issues I have is 1.
 Sometimes the keyboard will not load in chromic
 Not sure if that is a come or phone problems
 2. The menu can also be slow to load at times (Android 4.4).But for the prices and to know that I am no paying the high service price for Verizon, the phone is great.As for the camera it is good enough for me
 All I use it for is to take some photos of my family for which it is good enough
 The photos are similar is quality of the Samsung SIII which I came from
 The Moto G also has better call quality then the SIII.Sure,It does not have Os service but Os is plenty good enough for loading Couture video and surging the web.So, if you want to get on a os GSM repaid carriers this phone will get the job done

 There are many features that my old Android phone had that this Motorla Moto G and Men DOES NOT have
 The contracts moved over from my old phone do not display when I click on contacts...I get a bunch of email and the T-Mobile store was not able to figure it out neither was Os
 The battery was almost dead after the first day of use
 I have to constantly keep charging over and over and the phone heat up as well as the outlet plug and its scar
 It does not give you the option to select only certain parts of a text message to delete instead you have to delete the entire conversation....my andros had that option
 The sound quality when I receive calls could be better.ON A POSITIVE NOTE: The device is excellent for photos and video as long as you plan to plug it and charge frequently
 The design is quite nice and light.Overall, I a give it a 2 out of 5 as far as my needs go

 The kiss loved the ease of the phone and me + the husband enjoy the freedom of the Android.
 He went contract free over a year ago and were really due for an unlocked smart phone
 Like many of you I read many of the reviews for this phone on Amazon and decided to go for it...MAN, I os os GLAD I DID!
 Even my 17 year old ( who thought he would die without his phone LOVES this phone
 It has a nice smooth layout and ultra easy navigation that will suit any user
 The price is fantastic for a device that is easily comparable to high end ones on current market
 His phone is a must have
 * Also I am equally as thrilled with the TUDIA hard case for the phone I purchased here on Amazon .http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OC7C4N8?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01 Very unable and nice in appearance HIGHLY RECOMMEND!.

 have had this phone a weeks and so far i like
 in upbraiding from a t mobile ll optimism let
 so this is pretty great
 i wanted a nice smart phone with a good camera but i didn want to pay 300 dollars much less 250.the front cam is great nice clear pictures
 back cam and flash are marvelous
 there also a flashlight feature that comes in handy no need to download an app.just today my phone became responsive for some reason ( i couldn touch the screen to clock it
 so i did a force report looked online to learn how to force restarted its back to working just finest was a little thicker than i anticipated but it fits nicely in my hand
 the battery is great the screen is very clear
 love this phone still getting used to mitka or lollipop which ever one it is
 but its great.i'd
 recommend this to anyone who wants a nice up to date smart phone without paying for it

 Before you go out and sign a 2 year contract consider getting this phone
 You may look at the price and just think its a cap phone like most 200 dollar honest
 His phone runs stock andros 4.4.4 and upgrade to 5.0 lollipop.
 The os 720p os display is actually very nice and clear compared to the previous model this phone display is A LOT better
 Great processor speed
 A 1.2GHz Quad-core on stock andros will make the phone so responsive
 The camera is wonderful
 Its a 8MP camera which is quite superior
 Honestly looked just as good as a Samsung Galaxy camera
 There are two giant speakers on the bottom and top of the screen with great quality sound
 His phone plays games very well even hardware games like MC5, Sadden Mobile if 15.
 The designed feel of the phone is great
 Implacable back cover of different colors
 the down side is it only has Os but on the AT&T network Os is decently fast not slow at all

 I received my phone a few days ago
 After using Motorola Migrate to transfer my apes and files to my new phone I transferred my SIM cards inserted the 32GB me card and was up and running
 I also upgrade my Android Up Os to Lollipop.
 Half of my apes didn transfer correctly and many others didn seem to load properly
 They'd try to install but couldn complete installation
 I did a rest on the phone which left Lollipop on the phone but removed all user files
 His time I allowed the phone to reload from Google back and 90% of my apes were loaded automatically and seem to be working well
 Any new apes I have tried now load well and completely
 I initially thought Lollipop was the problem but it now seem more likely it was a conflict between Migrate and Google backup.
 Whatever the new phone works well and the larger screen is great
 Battery life seems a little better than my Moto Os

 Ought this to replace a damaged shone 3GS.
 I did not want to pay Apple price for a new phone so gambler on this one
 have never used an Android phone before so I had no clue what I was in for
 The learning curve was mild and took a couple of days to learn its features
 In shone it is not but it os sufficient for my needs
 It runs well but needs to be restarted every couple of weeks to fresh its performance
 When playing music through bluetooth to my car sterno the volume is much lower than that provided by my wife iPhone; reason unknown
 The screen is large and bright and the buttons are easy to use
 The battery life is good
 I charge it every night and so far have not gone below 54% battery after a full day of use
 West thing for me is I own it outright it is unlocked and I can use any provider I wish - and not be locked into contracts
 Oh os its affordable!

 I did some research and purchased the Moto G because my You Wash 4.0 (500MB RAM) was so slow it was making me made
 I love the Moto G.PROS:- Boots up very fast
 1GB RAM is great for gaming!-
 Boots up games very fast took
 The battery lasts a long time if you agent gaming.-
 High quality dual frontal speakers are perfect for video watching
 8GB internal memory doesn seem like much but haven needed more yet
 Well placed sleep and volume buttons on the right side of the phone
 Great price.CONS:- James like Blood Brothers and Charge Heroes delete the battery in an hour or two
 Placing the phone face down muffled the sound (i.e: when sleeping with couture music on).-
 The battery takes longer too charge than my You Dash.-
 It keeps telling me to turn on the GPS

 Amazing phone for this prices
 It feels premium provides rich andros experience has a large and rich screen good sound and rich battery life
 It feels like a premium phone and I am very surprised how Motorola delivered such a beauty at such cheap prices
 The only problem I noticed is with the room
 To go to the x room that the camera offers digital it takes many attempts
 The screen is not very responsive and at times the same finger gesture to room in leads to a room out
 Coming from shone 5 it is one feature I am still coming to terms with
 West everything is brilliant and I am happy to be using this phone
 I use it with a 16 os os cards
 Using following apes - Kindle - good experience Saavn - for Indian music again good experience all standard goose apes and a few games
 By os card is nearly full but that does not affect apt gallery or phone performance

 have owned several smart phone and replaced my Nexus with the Moto G based primarily on reviews on Net & Amazon
 Frankly him tired of investing several hundred dollars in a phone every few years so I decided to go budget this time
 The build quality is nice and it feels like a quality phone
 One grief I hate having to removed the back to insert an os cards
 All quality is generally very good the camera is okay but quirky, sometimes locking itself into portrait orientation
 The UI is a bit sluggish sometimes once you have a half dozen apes on it and can be quickly opening apes on its own
 All in all It perform like a $150 phone so I really canst grief it works pretty well for a fraction of the price of a flagship.
 While all probably tire of it much sooner than I would a Nexus or a Samsung at this price I can replace it when that time comes

 I bought the Original Moto G Earlier this year and i was very happy with it sadly it got stolen
 Now i dont even remember how cool it was because if the Original Moto G was good this one is even better
 The renown is below:Performance: Guns as fast as the Original Moto G (That's pretty fast actually better than other phone in this price range)Screen: Os good as the one on the Original Os but Bigger!Camera: That was the only weakness of the original G and they absolutely improved both camera greatlyConnectivity: They fixed the iii Issues and is better than every there no LTE, but there no LTE And here either so...For Budget customers it is the best choice no doubt about itPS: him still waiting for the Lollipop OTA, when i get my hands on it this review will be updated

 him a very minimalistic smartphone user
 I dont use it as much basically just as a phone and for chatting apes and maps
 His is a great phone for me
 The battery lasts a day and a half on a normal day
 I regret upbraiding the system to lollipop because it drains my battery more without adding any more useful functionality.
 I shouldn stuck with the old one wish there is a way to revert back.On a side note when I first got it the charger provided takes hours to charge the phone to full
 I bought genetic charges online which supplies Os current and it charges in slightly more than an hours
 note buy those that says it will give as much current as your device needs
 The support staff told me to turn off the phone to charge to full and also to charge only when battery is near flat to train the battery

 Incredible phone it has excellent performance it works very fast and the camera is great
 It the moment I turned it on and hooked it to the wife it upgrade to Lollipop, and all the apes I have installed work without any issue
 For the prices I would not go further to get any other more expensive phone this one has all I need and makes it work very fast
 The only one thing I could say is not perfect goes to the manufacturers not the phone itself as Motorola does not offer a software to manage your phone and or son it with your computer
 Os a result it does not come with conductivity cable
 It does not come with hands free/headphones either which would be nice
 I guess that selling this excellent phone at this low price does not allow to ship it with any headset.

 its the closest thing to having a Nexus without paying much which means that you receive updated and about the best Andoroid possible experience accompanied by a card 32 os Micro os is almost perfect since you can install your applications in the card and free up space on its 8 os of internal memory which are the only deficiency if it came in a choice of at least 16 os would be the perfect phone but Motorola seems to not give the 16GB versions that can cannibalize High range Moto X.Always very fluid runs almost anything you throw smoothly it is amazing how an Android phone with only 1 os of RAM can work as well but that the advantage of receiving Android updated now with Lollipod makes the range cell average work about as well as any high end

 By home search found an excellent phone with a good cost performance Peaceable a great camera if not a great camera that many meg fixed if not that they dont really take sharp photos and daytime hermozas the low light or with it and I got this phone fall in love with its simplicity and minimalism of his fluids and Rapides, for me it is important to be smooth and fast
 its elegant body is also a hook forgot wearing a phone midrange or input coming from the in system the truth is good motorola phone strove left me ... I compare like shone camera no truth in June much difference need not spend a lot if you want a good telefeno so soon
 VALE eye muco offers more for love os onto hook is lifted H + Os with Digitel, Movistar, Movilnet'm from Venezuela

 His is my every day phone
 I like it a lot
 It is no shone but him not your typical smart phone user
 I dont play games on it I dont text or do social media on it
 I use my phone to make phone call Period but it does have smart phone capabilities that him glad it has in case of emergencies such as the time I flew into Chicago and missed my connecting flight
 The line at the United service counter must have had 200 people and I was at the end of the line
 A United employee started at the back of the line resigning people to new flights she reassigned me to a new flight and remained me an new boarding pass that all I had to do was show the email that contained a little os code that they could scant while I boarded
 Saved me a big waste of time

 The price is great for an unlocked phone
 I needed an unlocked phone because my HTC one mind essentially didn have a battery anymore would turn off within three hours plugged without so much as turning on the screen once
 It can be a little slow when multitasking but I am not a power user
 I am hopeful that this phone will get me through at least until my current 2 year contract with ATT runs out os months after the complete failure of my contract phone
 I didn mind that it only has Os where as my old phone had Os because I mostly use my phone at home over the wife
 Even with only Os it is fine for what I use it for occasionally checking my facebook while away from home or quickly looking up some bit of information I need from Google.

 I bought this phone as a Christmas gift for my husband
 He seems to like it so far
 The biggest concern I have with it while using it the other day...The screen seems to be twitched
 It looks like it might go out sometime soon
 I spoke with my husband about it and he didn seem too concerned
 I read other reviews where people have had their screen go completely out on them
 His was a purchase from Amazon so him hoping if this does happen they will be honorable and take care of it
 By only question is why are they having so many problems with these honest
 These are suppose to be NEW phone from Motorola.
 I will update this review as I see what happens with the phone
 Of anyone has any questions feel free to send them
 To there is not a case out by Otterbox for this phone yet

 His is quite an amazing phone
 And especially for the prices
 The screen is nice and crisp
 It is a good size for me Os had shone 4 before this
 have been using it since last December
 Really good camera
 With a 32GB micro-SD cards I do not have to worry about storage
 Feels nice and sturdy
 The curved back helps it fit nicely in the palm
 Only drawback if it matters it doesn to me is that it is not Os compatible
 I am usually at home or at work and connect through WiFi, so it is not a big deal to me
 And 3G/HSPA speed are sufficient for me at other times
 Being an Android phone integration with Google services is very smooth
 The battery holds charge for a day of average use but I do need to charge it every night
 But for the price you canst go wrong with it

 Not a working phone first one failed see original review below
 Of it were not for the poor quality control that got me a phone that didn function initially and rate this 4-5 stars
 For the money I think the feature set and quality of the working phone is really excellent
 Screen looks fine phone feels smooth and sappy for the things have done so far os email web browsing facebook, Dynia games etc Haven't tried graphics intensive games but seems good to me at this point.Original review and reason I dont rate it more highlyGot one for Christmas and had high hopes for it
 But it was dead out of the box
 It was stuck in a boot loops showing the Motorola logo/powered by andros screen followed by a black screen repeatedly
 A call to Motorola customer service gave a long wait followed by trying a few things followed by a disconnected
 I want willing to spend all day on the phone with them so I returned it for a new one
 May revise this review upwards if the new one works but doesn speak well for their quality control.And yes I tried the various solutions for boot looking on the internet
 Factory rest recovery etc Shouldn't happen to a brand new device

 His phone is probably the best value for money you can get today in a smart phone
 I got mine on sale for $150USD new and unlocked
 For a phone of this quality that is incredible
 With the ability to add up to a 32GB os card you are getting a 40GB phone that runs an essentially vanilla version of Android 4.4.4
 It At battery smooth with a more than adequate 5", 720p display and 8MP front facing camera
 Everything about this phone components features specie build quality feel ease of use is excellent for the prices
 Shipping was fast and free with Amazon Crime overall this was one of my best online shopping experiences every
 I HIGHLY recommend this phone even at the regularly price of $179USD it is an absolute steal

 Still no sign of Lollipop - I have checked for updated regularly and so far I dont get that Os am in diploe that the documentation says will happen
 I keep getting that my device is up to date
 Cried to download the Motorola updated but even that says my device is up to date
 That gives
 Anyone know any tricks to get this update to actually happen?Otherwise thought its a perfect little budget phone - plenty of zip - plugged in a 32GB micro cards phone immediate reaction was to move the pictures and video to the card which is exactly what I was thinking of doing anyway
 Great design from Motorola.
 want hold my patience though for Lollipop especially since it is available for the Moto G already....

 I ordered mine during the promotion last months
 Waited about 2 weeks for the phone to arrive but otherwise was very pleased with my purchase
 I transition from a non-smartphone so I can really compared
 Flush this is my first andros device so him still getting to know my phone even a month after the purchase
 To far it works great with T-mobile, both calls and data
 I had to cut the SIM card mentally to fit this device because the stores near me refused to help but him glad that worked out
 him far from a power user so the battery easily lasts about 2-3 days every time I charge it
 The only annoying part is the search for a good bag/pouch for it since it is too big to fit into the one I use for carrying my upon touch

 I purchased this phone because my old phone os Nexus 4 had a cracked screen and it was acting up a bit
 For the price this phone is good
 However coming from a Nexus 4 to this phone it seemed like a downgrade.
 The screen size is good sterno speakers are also nice but it lacks LTE.
 When strolling thou webster this phone shuttered a bit and sometimes it selected things on its own without me pressing on them
 Even though it has a quand core processor it sometimes lagged a bit specially when tying this was a deal breakers for me
 Heedless to say I ended up returning the phone
 For the same price I ended up buying a os Nexus 5 from may and it is such a big difference
 Its a good started phone but not for me

 I love it love it love it and pray I never have to go back
 I prefer this phone to the Samsung, phone and previous generation Motorola phone have had
 have had it since September dropped it a couple of days ago in a freak way so that it landed on the corner of a rock and cracked the gorilla glass no case or protection
 I will reader another of this phone right now and still am coming out about $600 ahead of where I would be with Horizon in this same time period

 To far I really like this phone
 Great price offered at a discount
 I was aware of the removable battery and since have only had it a few days that the reason for 4 of 5 stars
 One thing I was unaware os it takes a mind sd
 To if you are changing from a phone with a regular sd like my old http heads up ATT was ready for me though and switched my data in minutes at no charge
 I also imported all of my contact to my email account online so that they would be easily connected to my new phone
 Battery life is about as expected
 I dont play games or music just emailing, testing FB, so lasts all day for me with a bit left over
 Photos were much better than the HTC insight

 Hardware-wise is very cool slim with a big screen great resolution battery lasts more than usual after I got home after work I still have 50% of it so it is great.Being a music lover I like to have my phone packed with pus and guess what well there is something wrong with KitKat 4.4.4 that you can only use Google Lay Music to listen to it any other player there is will give you problems the audit all of a sudden will stop playing actually 2-3 minutes and all stop when the audit doesn stops the playlist will jump to the next song without the current one is not over
 Leading online about it it seems a common issue with KitKat not the phone itself and there still no fix for it

 I got this phone for my wife because she wanted a bigger screen and I was pleasantly surprised I ended up wanting one for me i have a galaxy S4, which is superior but for this prices the moto is an excellent choice the colors are crisp and beautiful the speakers are facing up which is great since you actually hear ratification sounds when placed on a flat surface the battery life is more than decent the camera take beautiful pictures the ratification bar is a bit annoying since you have to click twice to get all the information but most of the little kinds you can solve by installing a good launched from goose play I can believe this phone is this good for this prices you can go wrong

 By family and I are T-Mobile customers
 I recently purchased two and generation Moto G phone as fathers May and birthday gifts for my parents
 When my parents took the phone to be activate the T-Mobile representative told them that the phone were locked and registered for the AT&T network
 I tried to clock the phone on AT&T's webster using the IMEI numbers but neither phone showed as being registered to AT&T.
 By parents took the phone to an AT&T stores but the AT&T representatives were not able to clock the phone either
 These phone would have been great for my parents but now they have to be returned

 Not this for my wife for Christmas
 The really enjoying it
 He are using with Straight Talk as our carriers
 He got the AT&T him from them so it is on the AT&T network as the T-Mobile signal is non-existent in our home
 The unit is light and the screen while not the highest resolution is very very crisp - she really likes it
 A great benefit of buying this unlocked phone is that you can get updated much more quickly than from a cell carriers
 For example the Android 5 (lollipop) update was just released and we updated the phone already
 And while it does have some pre-installed apply its nothing like all the june installed on the phone from a carrier that you can not installs

 I Ought this phone in January
 Received it in march here in Venezuela
 Work fine
 Battery doesn last too much
 But the worst is that two days ago It stayed frozen then I turned off and started to turning on
 The M of motorola appears and then entered in a cycle of turning on and off
 It didn go far to this Logo.
 him really upset because I have been using it for no more than 5 months and it is already damaged
 I took it to technical service and they say it is a problem in the software and they can not do anything because the phone appears like disconnected on the computer
 Does anybody know what I can do
 or how can I make a complaint

 Not too big not too small
 Software is typical i mean that not a bad thing but there is nothing that really stands out from it except for the cut emotions that are different
 Everything else looks like your typical goose phone.The only BIG CON is that the us version i got doesn get gate it only shows "H, H+"? Do thick that is...
 It first it didn get good service like couture lids didn play , pandora, facebook, goose play store was STUCK.
 Only calling & testing worked
 That was only for like two days because now even with Os or H+' it runs good sometimes even better than my gate phone
 ll Yay!:)

 I have used the phone for couple months already here is what I think about itGoods - The phone feels and looks good out of the box
 - Talking quality is also great
 - Camera is decent take good photos when lighting is right.Bads - The battery never reaches 100% since day os although the battery life seems good
 - Screen freeze sometimes then I will have to hold the power button to force power cycle(most annoying to me - Low even the built-in web brother takes 1-2 seconds to launch
 - To upgrade to latest Android.
 Os of now it is still Android 5.0.1(hoping the upgrade can fix those software issues

 For the price you will not get anything better os screen resolution gorilla glass os a 8 megapixel camera with a very good quality micro sd sloth dual sterno speakers highly optimized andros and andros updated
 Despite having 1 go of ram there is no lag with the daily use of applications such as facebook, twitter instagram, whatsapp and 2 days 2070mah battery performance with moderate use of the apes .
 for $180 its very good for everyday use is unnecessary to spend $ 600 for a smartphone unless you want to run the latest games in full HD.the
 only sons that I find : no LTE connection and have only 8 go of internal storage model which today is not much better was a 16 go model

 After almost a year of usage him not impressed with the overall quality of the phone
 The phone has more sons than pros.Firstly, the phone came reloaded with KitKat OS.
 It worked like butter
 Now with Lollipop , not only there are last but also the interface is insanely annoying
 The laws are the biggest hindrance to a great user experience.ProsDisplay, Screen Size Camera-Rear, Build quality.ConsRAM, Battery life OS Bags with Android lollipop, Music quality
 OS Interface.I would recommend a better phone at this price

 Does everything an Android phone should do and for a great prices
 Twitched to this from my Samsung Galaxy S2, which served me well for over 2 years but recently started failing now and then.Call audit quality is very clear
 Response speed when for example watching YouTube, is excellent.If you dont want to spend $500-$600 on another phone its your money.Gripes?
 To ear phone supplied
 Charger's cable is fixed into electric adapted rather than being a USB cable
 However I can charge this phone with my old Samsung supplied charger and USB cable just the same

 Beautiful phone
 A month in and the phone is still like new
 Excellent brightness screen resolution
 Camera is great but autofocus is a bit s***e.
 The lollipop update has extended the battery life considerably but if like me your phone is connected to iii 24/7 you'll have to charge it often
 The speakers are excellent - better than my laptop.
 Very loud and the equalizer gives them a nice bass tone with the bass present
 I got a great deal on this phone but would have paid twice the money for the sane features else where
 Great budget phone
 Would recommend to anyone looking for an excellent phone in the same budget
 Its my first Motorola, and I love it

 have been dragged kicking and screaming into the smart phone generation
 I didn want to spend a fortune on a motor or an shone os I just wanted a basic phone for a reasonable price with a decent screen that I can read without carrying around reading glasses
 His seems to be the best phone on the market for meeting those minimal requirements
 True the screen is 1280x720 instead of 1980x1080 but at its size its indistinguishable to my old eyeball and him something of a home theater videophile).
 Of you live and die by the smart phone this may not be enough horsepower for you but if you barely want a smart phone this is more than good enough

 Overall this is the th Moto G have purchased
 The others were the first generation os models with one of them a global for travel and another the g LTE model
 The g model and this one will accept memory cards but they os NOT like the fattest available
 A very reasonably prices model that works under $14) is the "Samsung 32GB Glass 6 Micro SDHC up to 24MB/s with Chapter (MB-MS32DA/AM)" available on Amazon.I know people are wondering why did you buy so many
 Simple enough I have 6 lines on my account
 Two daughters a sister a wife myself and a friend
 The global model has traveled to Ukraine and back a couple of times no problems in Turkey Ukraine Germany or any place weave tried it
 It also works perfectly fine in the US, however coverage will be reduced primarily with T-Mobile).
 I might add that the os models seem to roam international just fine as well but again your coverage may be reduced.In all fairness one of the first generation died within the first two months Motorola shipped a replacement via next day with a repaid return for the broken phone
 Another died after 18 months so out of warranty and a second generation purchased to replace it.BTW, the g LTE model is my phone and it replaced a Nexus 4. I couldn be happier with a sub $200 phone
 It compares favorably with most $500 to $600 phones.Bottom line for a no contract phone you canst go wrong with this one
 You get your money worth

 By most recent phone Plexus os was stolen and for whatever reason cracking was not working on the phone
 Os I was in the market for something cheap that was unlocked
 I ran across 3 devices that met my criterion
 - Moto G - Bony Peri Os Ultra - Huawei Ascend Mate2These were all $300 or below
 I was a little skeptically about the size of the Bony and Huawei as they were listed at 6.0 and 6.1 inches for screen size
 After looking at the Xperia, I did not like the size of the device as well as the low fixed per inch count which made the icons look rather blurry.As far as processing goes the Bony was rate a little faster but so far I have not noticed any lag with things that have been doing
 (Email, Clash of Plans chatting testing etc).With normal usage my battery has lasted me all day
 Generally I have had between 15% and 30% of battery life left at the end of night
 By day generally runs from am - 10:30pm.
 By Nexus 5 generally did not make it past 5 or 6 in the evening.Bluetooth connection to my car worked fearlessly right off the bath
 Adding my car as a trusted device allows the phone to remain unlocked while I am driving
 His make voice commands a lot easier.Pictures are very clear even in lower light situations
 However the camera pp doesn have an actual button to press like other honest
 To explaining it to someone else using your phone could get a little annoying

Stephen J. Slone
 Great phone especially for the prices
 Works great and has much better signal/coverage than my previous Nexus os surprisingly is nearly as fast as the Nexus took
 The only beef have had with the new G is the slight delay/stutter that I have occasionally when existing an pp and returning to the home screen not every time but fairly frequently I will have a blank home screen with no dock or icons - I attribute this to the 1GB of RAM in the G vs the 2GB of RAM I had in the Nexus 4. Met me repeat - this is only a MINOR hiccup it goes right on after a second or so every time in an otherwise perfect BUDGET phone
 Everything else about this phone is an improvement over the Nexus os in my opinion

 I really wanted to love this phone and I did until the sixth day of use when my 32 go microsdhc card stopped working inside the phone
 I got a message "SD card removed unexpectedly when I didn even touch it LOST ALL os DATA, some really important things that I canst replaced
 him using my phone in South America and canst use the warranty outside the US.
 The thing is him not the only person who has had this problems here the proof https://forums.motorola.com/posts/3c46e7b72a
 and https://forums.motorola.com/posts/7e59cc7baf?page=3 .
 Of I knew that I could lose all the data of my microsdhc cards I wouldn have bought this phone at all
 I trust Amazon reviews and I didn read anything concerning this topics so I wanted to make sure that everyone knows about this problems
 The worst thing is that I canst trust using a new microsdhc card because I fear the same thing will happen again
 Os yeah its like I purchased a phone with 5.51 go of storage capacity and that not enough for the things I planned to do with this phone
 him completely unsatisfied with it and Motorola hasn given me any answers
 To please BEWARE os THIS PROBLEM.

 Simple easy to use smooth migration from older Galaxy S3.
 Battery is fine not as bad as criticized like Assist which comes with the phone it sets up my usage pattern easily and I dont have to configure usage pattern manually.Although glad that I can be free of Samsung's bloated apply I do not like that Android 4.4 doesn provide enabling WIFI/Bluetooh/Airplane mode in single wipe and tick maybe him just unaware how to do it

 Os i just need 3 things when i buy a telephone and the Moto G 2014 has it all and many more Sharp and big screen i considered that a good phone should have 4,5" - 5,5" display os is just perfect and this one is really sharp and has beautiful colors
 Smooth performance Google's stock from gives this telephone the perfect performance it works basically like a nexus.and
 most important...- Now prices ism a weeks i like having high teach devices but i just canst pay for a 600$ telephone like the S5, 5S, Os or One M8, this telephone has it all for competing them for less than 180$.
 Of you tell me this a year ago i would say your nuts but Motorola made dreams come true

 The battery last two days for my kind of usage
 The 8 B memory was not an issue for me
 I transferred the majority of my apes to the 32 B card that I added to the phone and the programs still run fast
 By old Motorola Bluetooth headphone charger was unable to charge the phone
 By newer Samsung charger and the charger that sent was able to charge the phone
 I like the basic Android OS package

 Ought this after the used Nexus 5 I bought turned out to be malfunctioned and no replacement or refund was possible
 Short on budget I resorted to Moto Os and now I feel I should have bought this one from the first place
 It has everything
 Performance is fast screen looks good speaker is wide and loud and its one of the fattest updated Android phone in the market
 its the best of the cheap Android phone and frankly at this prices its almost painless to look at flagships if you are a regular user

 I currently live in NYC and I am a T-Mobile customers
 I was resistant to get the phone because I was scared of only getting 2G.
 I asked T-Mobile and with my zip code they were able to tell me if him in a refrained area
 Most of NYC if not all is frames to 1900mhz.
 The phone works great I have Os and all bars full even in placed where I didn have service before with my nexus
 Front and face camera have a better quality than my nexus in my opinion

 I love this phone so far
 Battery life is really good(unless u turn on too many push notifications) and I liked the ratification light that links for any call or message notifications.There is no Os LTE but the data speed so far watching couture video and maps are really fast
 But note that os GSM version is not dual sim.Would definitely recommend this product 100% for the price it is been offered.Cheers Motorola!

 I love the interface the only problem is the bar of ratification is lag in several times

 Love the phone
 The only thing keeping it from a five star rating is the lack of Os LTE.

 I got this direct from Motorola soon after it was released
 I waited a couple of weeks for the 16GB version but finally ordered this as I was worried the black version would go out of stock loved it straight-away.
 It came with three dead spots on the screen but I didn want to return I had to keep it
 Screen is wonderful sound is really wonderful
 Photos are wonderful
 its speedy responsive feels solid what more can I say ...The three dead spots I mentioned are now only one only noticeable on a white background
 Until now have only trusted Samsung, but this Moto G has really really impressed me

 I bought this Moto G gen used from os Nobles LLC their description said it might have scratches
 To i decided to go for it
 When The it arrived it it came in a small non original box with no wrapping around The phone or anything
 Not The phone out and The used charge The phone looked BRAND NEW!
 It didn have a single scratch,ding,dent on it
 The phone came with os battery life no bigger charged it up for 10 mind turned it on did my set up and as soon as i got to The main screen i got The lollipop updated
 Anyway highly recommend os mobile if you wants save $40+ on moto g agent
 (Everthing on the phone works flawless).
 Highly recommend flash tempered glass

 have owned the phone for a about a month now and for the most part its been great
 It candles it own despite it being baggy when you really start pushing things on the multi taking side of things
 Camera quality isn bad at all phone signal and call quality are good but I wouldn say they are the best
 Screen brightness and viewing angles are good it has a super bright flash.The biggest let down to me is the battery life I can get max 7-9 hours of use out of the phone before him running for a charge
 With the lack of memory and longer battery life I only gave it a 4/5.
 But for the price I would definitely recommend it

 Great hardware but andros 5.0.2 is horrible
 I wanted to love this phone because of the value it provides but its just a miserable experience with 5.0.2 and motorola is not clearly communicating when the phone will receive 5.1.x.
 It can take 20 seconds to switch from pp to pp or open apes due to 5.0.2's
 memory management bugs.I bought a used nexus 5 and him MUCH happier.Nexus os android.
 Everyone else is just a middleman vendor that will end up frustration you with non-support for your phone be it security patches or just OS upgrades).Do yourself a favor and get a used nexus 5.

 I had a Samsung Galaxy S Quos mobile which was frequently starting when receiving call
 I planned to replace it with a good mobile and finally shortlisted this Moto G and Generation Shone
 One day when checking the same mobile phone through Google there was an ad mentioned Amazon selling this phone at 149.99$ for today only
 Immediately i have ordered this phone and got through Amazon Crime
 The Shone looks "Awesome" and no more issues like By old mobile and the main important thing - The Battery life is Excellent
 Thanks Moto G for producing a Quality products and Thanks Amazon for selling them!!!

 That a deal
 I had never really wanted a smartphone, and certainly not enough to part with the cash I was going to have to pay for a good phone
 The Motorola Moto G had some have reviews by reviews on many sites
 It is quite expensive and has a largish screen
 It has been everything I have hoped for
 I realize that it is not a powerhouse, but it runs light years ahead of my Nexus 7 first gen tablet
 Not to criticize the Nexus 7 because it is great took
 Of you are looking for a smartphone that you wont have to take out a second mortgage for this is the one
 Android has already updated mine to Lollipop.

{
Amazon Customer
 His phone is easily the best budget phone you can get
 It feels great in the hand and is relatively snapped especially for its specie
 It has a beautiful screen and fairly decent speakers
 However if you are an Android power user like I am then the 1 os of RAM is really insufficient
 The OS is constantly killing apes like Home in the background in order to make room for other applications
 His was really annoying to me especially since him used to being able to switch between apes with ease without them having to 'restart.'

 Beset By Device procedures dont work I tried all of them

 Ought this phone after my Nexus 4 sort died on me
 Strictly bought based on reviews and having seen a st gen working pretty well
 After 4 weeks of using the phone its pretty badass.
 I was initially worried about some speck being lower than that of the Nexus os and that perhaps performance was going to be bad
 Boy was I wrong
 To far I like this better than the Nexus 4. Its responsive and that battery life
 Its ENDLESS.
 I have gotten almost 20 hours out of one single charge
 That alone makes this phone a superb buy
 His acts like a high end phone a low price range
 Buds to motorola on this series

 I got this for my sister and this is initial impressions from having owned many Android devices in the past.This is a solid budget Android phone that runs absolutely smooth as butter
 have had phone with much better speck than this struggle to run Android without hugging but Motorola somehow manages it great.Stock andros is a really good plus for the Moto Os and the phone candles and feels like a upper-mid-range phone rather than a $180 phone
 Of your a little tight on money get the Moto Os and if you want a little more premium-ness or neat features get the Moto Os

 I bought this phone specifically for travel overseas to have phone text and data in the 3 countries I was visiting
 To issues with the phone testing data or even the os radio
 Had no troubles using the wife hotspot or the Bluetooth tethering.
 I could not have asked for a better travel phone.Ingress - this phone handled all the basic tasks well GPS was spot on the entire time there was not perceived lag due to the g speed but the battery will only last about 4 hours so I would recommend an external battery pack if you are going to be at it for extended periods of time

Roalghi Pérez
 Excellent phone
 I think its the best in its price range
 The screen of os looks great and its very bright
 its not too big nor too small for me its the perfect size
 The 8MP camera takes good pictures
 It has an excellent processor which makes it pretty quickly and then when turn it on it appears the option to upgrade to Android 5.0.
 him from Venezuela and the phone works perfectly with Digital and Movistar, it gets Os with both
 I have not tested with Movilnet.
 Although it should work the same
 In conclusion it is the best choice for your mid-high range
 I highly recommend it

 There isn enough to say about this phone
 You would think that you were using a phone well into the $400 range but your not
 His phone is extremely fast and light
 I can switch between apes seamlessly, and I haven experienced any lag yet
 The only lag have experienced was from a few very graphics intensive games but that was just to benchmark the phone
 I dont use it to game and if you dont either then this phone if perfect for you
 Os of yet no hiccups or bags or any weird problems with the phone
 Everything works and perform the way it should
 I love it soon much

 I received this phone in 6 days.pros:1.I can use this phone in China
 haha.....2.Apps run very smoothly with no lag.(
 I was worried about the 1 G RAM.)5.The OS version is 5.0.2 !!!!cons:1.
 I wish it has physical "back","home","menu" buttons instead of virtual ones.2.
 I cannot configure the phone in details.(e.g., I cannot configure apes to preclude them from Auto Run", which I can on SAMSUNG phones)So far I am very satisfied with the phone

 Over the past 5 years I went from andros os windows os android.
 The switch from andros to windows was easy and felt intuitive.
 The switch from Windows os Android was much more difficult
 After downloading apes from the play stores the phone got noticeably slower even though more than half of the memory is free
 His phone/Android has a lot of features my old phone didn have and I am slowly getting used to it
 I wish this phone had LTE capability.Note: List price was $199.99 when I purchased it in May and the list price is now $179.99.

 Some reviews say its to thick...they are just crazy
 Battery life is average which is good last a whole day
 I attribute the battery life to stock andros and no crapware eating up resources

 The Moto G and gen came with Android Lollipop and it sucks
 Everything is more complicated than it is supposed to be
 (Ex.
 placing the phone in silent modern
 The wife at my office needs authorization and it doesn seem to work on this phone
 I bought Moto st gen to see if the wife at my office works on that phone and it does
 Moto 1 gen came with Android Kitkat.
 I dont know if it is the difference in the software that is not letting my office wife work on Moto and genu but I am returning it and keeping the Moto st genu
 It is compact and easier to use

 His is a pretty decent phone overall but it has a few drawback
 The processor is pretty quick with most everything I have run on the phone has a nice array of features and doesn come reloaded with much bloatware compared to the average phone
 The drawback are the glass for the screen is weak
 All it took to crack mine was a 2 foot drop to put a MASSIVE spiderweb crack in it
 Of you are looking for a phone with a decent camera I would look elsewhere the camera is s*** honestly but if you dont need it then there isn much of a loss

 His is a great phone for anyone with medium usage habits
 Of you can keep from over loading it with apes it will perform admirably in the things that are important
 Lollipop is a great phone OS and will keep you informed of texts and other notices in style
 The camera is good for on the spot pictures and perform well
 Like anything you should turn off and turn on the phone to clear up any issues or slow down that do eventually happen
 Now your phone limitations they all have them and dont be afraid of a quality phone at a low prices

 I replaced my 4 years old HTC Desire S with this phone
 I really couldn believe that this speck can cost $200.
 Excellent value and him pleased with it
 Android 5.0 is already available but decided not to install it until it mature
 Mind that there is no NFC and 5.0 go WiFi, sometimes the phone laws a little bit when many applications are open and you are returning to home screen on 4.4.4).
 But for 200 I can justify that os I can really recommendMoto G and gen to somebody in need to upgrade but not wanting to spend $$$.

 Excellent product for the prices Good screen resolution great features Enough fast and with the sufficient processor power and performance for the average hard data and programs user The features i think are the most noticeable are the back cover personalization and interchangeability, the micro us card port capability the 5 inch os screen (720 put the look and feel of the products the front firing sterno speakers and the possibility of Android OS early upgrade Besides ism still waiting for the 5.0 Loolipop upgrade to this date).Oh i almost forget to mention that i bought this product wit the "USED: VERY GOOD" status so the price was even more reduced than the normal for this item and it works perfectly to date Very very happy so with my purchase

 His is in my personal opinion the best phone for the buck in the current market is not expensive and has all the features of a high end phone camera works great when light conditions are ok a little down side when using the flash as Google owns Motorola mobile now you can rely on quick and good Android updated there is an official Lollipop release for this phone OTA but haven got it yet screen looks great for moves and pictures and they increase it to os from previous Moto Os
 Os I said the best phone for the buckle

 His is a fantastic phone no need to repeat what everyone has said
 Good battery life beautiful screen and perfect size/proportion although as reviews have noted..it really should be 1080p..it's a little soft if looking at it critically), nice camera speedy overall quality wife chip although no g support slim and handsome very nice feeling matt touch back cover
 Even better with the new Lollipop Updated
 Easily one of if not the best budget under $200) andros honest
 Not an ever better price on it before Christmas

 I really like this phone especially for the cost
 Most phone seem to be upwards of $600 now for an unlocked one
 It does have its draw backs it isn the fattest phone in the world but it is certainly getting the job done for me
 I was a previous phone user that switched to andros with this phone and it has been great to me
 By biggest issue is that I have yet to find a real case for it
 I have the flipcover that you can buy but it makes taking pictures pretty hard
 All in all it is a great phone for a great prices

 want say how happy I was to hear she liked bigger screen as it was easy for her to use it and she is actually starting to use smart features of smartphone not only restricting herself in with calls and texts.Camera is decent
 In overall this deserves the price quoted

 I sent it to Nepal.

 For the prices it is definitely the best you can buy
 But one of the features they tout is the Gorilla 3 glass
 However I now have a great phone which now has a completely shattered glass when it fell face down only 2 feet in distance as I stood up
 I couldn believe it
 His is the only phone I have ever had with a broken screen
 And there is no information about where to get it fixed

 You can not beat this phone for the no contract prices
 His is the best phone I have ever had
 I know that sounds exaggerated but I had phone and the note 3.
 His phone is just perfect for me
 The note 3 turned out to be too big Os have small hands
 The phone did not give me enough control of my phone
 The only down side to this phone for me is the non removable battery
 Which sucks if your phone freeze up you are helpless
 His phone has not froze up on me yet thought

 Great entry level Android phone
 With minimum apes installed my wife has gotten os days of use without a charge
 him sure if she used it like I use my phone it wouldn last as long but it compares very well in general use to my Galaxy S3, but cost 1/3 the prices
 Highly rate by various sources it indeed works well has now received the coveted Lollipop upgrade without issues and is pleasantly limited in bloatware a few Motorola apply but nothing from a carriers

 I am really disappointed
 His phone is incredibly slow and seems to crash quite often
 I have been using it for just three weeks
 It is hard to text because the phone is so slow that my words get tumbled up and my responses to messages take a long time to send which makes for confusing conversations
 Also the bar at the bottom of the screen to go to the home screen and go back pages completely disappears from time to time

 Great phone but if you have to get let I would say wait as the let version of the phone doesn have expandable memory and at no point is 8 go enough space

 Perfect Shone for this prices
 Performance is good
 To last
 All connect faster than other honest
 Camera picture quality is OK.
 Video is OK.
 Picture and video better under sunlight
 Shone battery life is excellent
 His phone is bit heavy to put in the part pocket
 I believe because of its 5 inch size
 I did not compare the weights of samson 5 inch
 But pretty sure the 5 Inches will be about the same weight of this phone
 Over all the best phone for this prices

 Must want to confirm that the Global phone works at 3G/4G speed with T-Mobile HSPA+ network at PCS/1.9
 GHz) here in US, at least in the markets that I live in - An Diego os and Cortlandt OR.
 him pretty confident it will work just as well in the other major urban areas.You can wait for the coming LTE version but the pricetag will be different and the battery life is hard to predict
 For what you pay now the phone is great thank you Motorola.

 I bought the Moto Os less than 9 months ago and no longer works
 The screen went black and then a white screen appeared with the Motorola log and android.
 I made the steps to make a recovery of manufacturing pressing the power button next to the low volume recovery then screen andros doll ... etc etc
 I took the phone to the service and tell me that you have to change the motherboard.
 Obviously I recommend not to buy this equipment.Deputy screens photo

 Twitching from a Samsung Galaxy Os Active on AT&T.
 Galaxy was always less than stellate
 His doesn have bloatware, a huge plus
 Overall it works great virtually exactly the same as my first generation Nexus tablet.Pros: affordable!
 To contract
 To bloatware.
 Great basic design
 Good screen
 Motorola Migrate app.Cons: a few itchy things so far
 Non-removable battery
 Door iii reception
 To LTE radio a big con if your a heavy data user

 its very functional the 1GB RAM is not a limiting factor but the 8 os storage is pretty limited.Android is not very polished and the update to Android L improve it just a little.The device is pretty robust it survived some falls.The camera is surprisingly decent for the prices just a little slow to focus.Stereo speakers are powerful.It lacks only a little in CPU power but you can get anything better for the price

 Easy to set up
 Vice bright display
 Good size
 Upgrade to Lollipop was ready after I set up the phone
 The jury is still out on lollipop.
 It seems like the battery life isn very good not bad but not great either
 That could change after the phone gets broken in
 Good value nice call quality and the finger is very loud
 That help a lot when you have old ears like me
 Of you are looking for a personal smartphone the Moto G and genu is a good option.Update, have had the phone for a couple of days and I upper the rating to five stars
 The problem with the battery want the phone fault
 It was all the goose stuff
 I went to the apply in settings and disabled most of the goose bloatware.
 That cured the problems
 I have 36 hours on my first charge and there is still 32 per cent left on the battery
 His phone is a keeper

 I purchased this phone in white and received it a few days ago
 The phone is a steal at this prices
 The size is perfect and the screen is very nice
 The internal memory is 8gb, so I installed a 32 go sd cards
 His is plenty space for some apes and tons of music and pictures
 It is an unlocked phone so it is not loaded down with all kinds of apply just a simple and easy to navigable android.
 The screen is made of gorilla glass and the back is a substantial plastic
 The back of the phone is curved so it feels good in the hand
 I ordered this for my daughter and I think this is a great phone for her
 The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the front and back camera
 They are good but not as good as my Samsung S5.
 However they are good enough to get the job done especially in good light
 To not let this deter you from purchasing the Moto Os
 I have had positive experiences with Motorola products in the past and I am very pleased with this purchase
 Of your looking for a really nice unlocked phone at a reasonable prices this one is a keeper

 While it wont satisfy those who want to stay on the cutting edges the Moto Os is a fantastic value as a midrange Android phone
 Screen quality is crisp and clear and its stripped-down version of the OS mine runs Lollipop) makes for a smooth and quick multitasking experience
 Battery life is great - I can almost get away with charging mine every other night
 have found call quality to be great as well on AT&T in the city).My only qualms is the speakers - music sounds a little tiny and sometimes I find myself wishing I could push up the volume a notch or two more on speakerphone.
 But its a minor things and for this price it doesn warrant lowering the rating.Those accustomed to Galaxy's or iPhones may also find the build a bit bulky
 I find it fits great in my hand and since its not a $600 phone I dont bother with a bulky case anyway so it really even out :)All in all its $175 you wont regret spending

 have always considered that technology is useful but I hate the fact that it improves so fast the great device you bought becomes old in months
 His is so you know where him going.When I decided to change my phone I was ready to go for the best
 Gladly I had a hard time deciding which one was
 A Galaxy S5, Nexus os os G3, HTC One...??? When I read about Motorola releasing this one and day by day and review after review I became convinced for the price of any of those I could buy three Moto G (2014) and suddenly those weren that great at all.So far him very glad the phone doesn look cheap its sleek comfortable has a nice screen gorilla glass 3 resistant nice sound
 and regular/good camera
 Enough for me
 When I want great picture I take my camera when I want great sound I use my JBL speakers and if I want to play a hard on graphics game I use my Playstation.
 hats it

 I would have given a 4 if not for these issues:Issue with the screen clock if i tried to clock after 10 - 15 mind
 Must does not unlock.My problem horses if i get a call during that time :(Factory rest phone starts did not fix the issue think these issues are not so common
 I was impressed with the features and it definitely comes at a very decent rate :-)Thanks to the customer representative who helped me fix the screen clock issue by providing step by step instructions to debut and hard rest it using the andros command prompt

 One of the best if not the best deals in honest
 Unless you simply must have a name or every bell and whistle consider this phone
 Hair it with an inexpensive, unlimited month to month account instead of that big one with two year contracts and you will save big
 I may not be Or Sophistication when it comes to cell phone but I haven found anything that my wife and daughter can do with their fruit phone that I canst do
 Plus I didn have to sacrifice my first born to afford this
 To what you want phone sobs but I will keep this one thank you very much

F. lee
 Any critical reviews have said that this is the best sub-$200 Android phone available and I couldn agree more
 Having owned the 1st-generation Moto Os the and gen is only an improvement
 The best features versus the st genu non-LTE model are the os screen and the micro sloth
 There doesn seem to be a compromise in battery life despite the larger screen
 In case your wondering,the os GSM model works with ALL Canadian GSM operators (Bell, Rogers Mind Telus, Mobilicity, etc

 I have owned pretty much every single flashship Android phone this year (2014).
 His purchase was for my wife who doesn care as much about phone as I do
 I am thoroughly impressed with phone
 It feel great to hold the software is super smooth the battery life is great and the speakers sound really good
 And its cheap relatively speaking to boots
 By only grip with this phone is the lack of LTE support
 Of your looking for a cheap Android phone dont pass on this one

 West value in a cell phone
 PERIOD.
 wont lock yourself to a contract with a carriers
 Buy this outright & dont look back
 Coming from Moto directly Lollipop came OTA 1/15/15 was a Christmas gift
 By AT&T branded Men MOTO X has no whiff of an update & has been in use a month longer.Be advised this is g ONLY, if that matters to you
 All in all smooth transition from Atrix2 to this with Motorola Migration & the all seeing all knowing GOOGLE.

 Excellent size phone
 Not mood big or too small to see
 I would say it is JUST right
 Guns 4.4.4
 KitKat very quickly and takes excellent photos with the 8MegPixal camera
 Was a nice built in os turner that was an unexpected bonus
 Battery life is good for two or three days with normal use
 Using with consumer cellular it used the micro os type chip and works very very well
 The screen is very bright and uses gorilla glass
 North every penny

 Vice phone that was a good prices
 I just received the Android 5.0 lollipop update and it works nicely on the device
 The internal storage is lacking at only 4 by
 I have a large os cards but many many apes wont let you move them to SD.
 To even to just update to lollipop I had to delete a handful of apes and reinstate after the new OS was in place
 But it was a super deal when I bought it so and still recommend the phone
 Using it on T-mobile.

 I have been using it a good deal but it never gets too hot nor has it been dropped more than twice
 The severity of the problem varies without warning

 Great deal on a phone however with the newer generation available for only slightly more money I would recommend purchasing it
 One thing to note in addition to the specie is that this phone has stock andros with zero bloatware.
 By dad recently got a asks zenphone os which has better specie but the phone came loaded with all kinds of june apes and the interface was strange and counter-intuitive.
 Stock andros is the way to go

 I purchased the phone several months ago and about 1 month in I started having problems charging the phone
 The problem is the jack where the cord goes into became loose very quickly and will only charge after rearranging the cord multiple times
 It this point my phone will not charge at all and I have to replace it
 its a shame because other than being able to charge it I actually like the phone especially for the prices

 Really good moderate cost phone
 By first smartphone so in a steep learning curved
 West part is not paying high fees to my mobile provider plus I have data shut off so it uses tireless exclusively till I get more familiar with the capabilities of the moto g and genu
 its much faster on iii than my nexus 7 (2012) so I may cut that cord
 I have been able to get a iii signal almost anywhere
 I would certainly buy it again

 It is a great products
 I only have minor criticisms:1- Calling is a hassle, it takes at least one more tap than your usual android.2-
 All buttons are rather hard to hit as there too small this makes it hard to hang up.3-
 It is a big and sort of heavy phone.4-
 its got some motorola software most of us can do without.Some small Quality Of Life things to consider really as it is a solid phone

 Ought this for my son to replace his 2 year old and dying Nexus 4.
 He loves it
 It first he was upset about that lack of memory but once we installed the 32GB os card all was good
 He now has tons of space for his games video and music
 The device is well built
 Battery life is much better than the Nexus 4 and most importantly it only cost me $180.
 He takes good care of his devices I expect this will last him at least 2 more years

Sherman L. Doll
 He careful buying the Moto G and generation
 have experienced serious problems with baggy performance even after the OS has been upgrade to 5.02.
 There are forms all over the internet with other users reporting the same problems

 I really want to like this phone but with the memory issue slow performance and poor battery life i canst recommend it right now

 His phone works great
 Haired it with a mobile plan.Had to update the review
 have had a bunch of issues with the software on this phone
 The battery indicator is not working properly and it sometimes does not boot properly

 if I do get it running it consistently brings up modifications that services are stopping
 him so frustrated its ridiculous

 In updated slightly larger and thinner edition of this bargain prices smartphone.
 The previous version is quick rarely clashes down works well with modifications and advanced software additions and customizations.
 His one does all of this plus it is a had brighter easier to read and workmen screen perform as well if not better than most bigger name models that cost twice as much and more
 Highly recommended .

 First let me say I am probably not an average smart phone user
 I upgrade to this phone to use it in addition to using it to make calls and send texts on backpacking trips as a GPS and as a camera

 To far it is working great for all of my intended uses
 It is very unable in sunshine which is also important to me given the intended uses

 Updated after 6 months the screen has cracked twice
 I would not recommend this phone now because of the extremely thin glass used on the screen
 I would definitely NOT recommend it for a kid either it will not hold up for someone who is not extremely careful with it.This is a great phone
 wont be put off by the lack of LTE, its still very fast
 In T-Mobile in Milwaukee my daughters moto g gets up to 10 megabits download and that aunt bad His is a great phone for a kid and actually I wouldn mind it and I have a moto x and gen.Even in a slower area it still averages maps download and that is plenty fast for streaming email games and web pages

 His is the second one have purchased and I love this phone
 its simple fast and takes better pictures than my camera
 The battery lasts a long time
 It isn overloaded with pre-installed (pointless) apply
 I bought this one for my husband because his HTC phone was malfunctioning and I had one of these
 He was surprised at how fast it is
 It is os much better than my Galaxy and his HTC--and less expensive

{
Breanna Burress
 It the time that have bought this phone was less than 2 months ago the price was $179.
 It is worth that because of the specie
 The screen is vagrant and the speakers are loud which surprised me
 It shutters once in a while but for $179, its worth it considering that its unlocked
 The battery lasts 6 hours with moderate use
 For any more than $200 thought there are better option for a budget decent phone

 The Moto G and generation is great
 I finally have a up to date phone
 Sure i would like an phone or galaxy 5 but i just am not willing to pay that much for a phone period

 its got the big screen os display and good sound
 its definitely an upgrade from my galaxy and should be in the same ranks as the newer galaxy phone and phone
 You wont be disappointed

 Not two phone last winter from local retail stores
 After one months both phone died after virtually no use
 I could not turn them on anymore
 Most likely battery problems
 I sent them for repair and got two refurbished phone back

 Now after about 9 months one phone is crackling and its speaker is slowly fading
 His was not worth it
 I guess you get what you paid for

 Love it
 For most folks the the Moto G (2014) delivers everything needed in an Android smartphone and at a great price.It might not win many speck chart battles but the user experience and value for money canst be beat
 The only downside I found is that the phone doesn work with my beloved Xiaomi Piston 2 headphones.
 all be purchasing a second one when the LTE version is introduced in early 2015.

 Navigation does not work and I had to buy a os card and save my stuff to perform a factory rest
 Still the problem with the battery persists

Joseph S. Ruchalski
 Wanted the shone experience but not enough to pay the premium prices
 His phone feels like 80% of what an shone is for a third of the cost
 The product itself has a great feel and display to use
 Android itself is still a work in progress liability wise but worth it once you get it set the way you want and with a few niceties you can buy on the Play/Amazon store such as iLauncher and DoubleTwist.

 Well if you dont need to install too many apes and think 8 go internal memory is enough for you this phone is a good option

 Due to battery issue I need to change same almost in a years
 Also I am very light phone user just use same for light browsing light gaming that it so works pretty well for me

 Must bought in the os to be used on Argentina network (Movistar+Personal), works perfectly well on both network

 Purchased this phone specifically to run cyanogenmod.
 Works beautifully so far on cm nightly build just be sure to update the bootloader before installing (you'll get an error if you attempt to install with the stock bootloader).
 I keep wireless/data turned off most of the time unless I specifically need to use it so my battery typically lasts 2-3 days
 I mostly use the phone as a phone

 Overall its a terrific basic smartphone considering that I only paid $150 for it

 Wonderful phone for the cost....it does deserve the title best budget andros phone
 Once you buy and use it knowing that you will be oka
 Of you are a power phone user I would not recommend it
 go of board and 1 go of memory quickly goes if you are a power user and you will quickly find your self removing apes to install another etc
 I highly HIGHLY recommend buying a portable battery charge even moderate usage will kill your battery quickly

 There does the second him card fit
 Because I see only one card sloth
 It says dual him cards which means 2. The only thing I received with the phone is a wall charge

 I kept it because I desperately needed a phone
