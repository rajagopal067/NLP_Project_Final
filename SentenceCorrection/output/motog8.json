 Rose Firstly Thanks to flipkart for delivering the product much before than its delivery date... Secondly,The Build quality of MOTO G is excellent,it looks like a premium quality phone when you see the initial impression Thirdly,It is a stock andros phone which you would expect to get upgrade Android L(lollipop) Finally,Adding os card slot which is a major upgrade observed in moto Os Sons 1.During the peak volume,the speakers produce a distorted noise 2.Slow charging & not happy with moto charger & ave head phone 3.Fast discharging(After Android L updated need to keep overnight charging & battery back would be hardly from 22 his to 24 his
 over usage of Pp esp Asphault 8 & other bloatware apps)causes too much heat at the back side of the phone
 Considering overall aspects I would strongly suggest moto G if you are looking for a mid range budget andros honest

 The battery back up of this mobile is just useless it drains fast... the next minus point is screen glass this mobile slips down from my part pocket and totally broken and i went to service center they told that it costs 6750/- ( i just shocked and told that screen glass not covered in warranty...
 Any Any times my old smartphone os optimism Sub slips down but never broken till know thus the quality of Gorilla glass which given by LG...

 His product was delivered quickly and in mint condition
 But then this is to be expected as it was from os Details
 The phone itself holds up pretty well
 Its robust and seems durable.
 Have already dropped it a few times and have only noticed a slight stuff in the middle
 His was the result of the phone falling face down on to the floor of an auto rickshaw.
 Met the phone behaves as expected
 It was slightly responsive from day one thought but this I attribute to the phone designs flaws and not an actual efficiency with the product sold

Sushant Rawal
 I was very pleased with the hands that I have received
 I have been using it for quite a while now and I am very satisfied with it
 The only issue is the persistent lag in the phone over a period of time but that is the Android 5.0.2 issue which will be fixed once the 5.1 update comes out
 Overall the battery life and the camera picture quality is quite good for a phone at this price range

 hey guns moto g is water resistant
 the meaning of water resistant by motorola people is it can resist only 1 or 2 drops of water
 not more than that
 if it is more that 2 drops they are not responsible
 my mobile accidentally fell in water and within 3 seconds i took it out
 and now it is not working
 screen is k but touch is not working
 moto service centre guy said both touch and mother board damaged
 need to replace those 2. it means except cover everything will be new in mobile
 and it costs 6000 os for changing those
 so guns ply beware against water

Libith Whitley Lazar
 His is first andros phone for me and is very userfrienly and fast in response
 But one thing found was the battery which drains faster when use
 For egg if it is 60% and when we brows or see something in phone its battery reduces per minute 45 os 40% slowly slowly reduces
 Battery life still to be improved in MOTO G2.

 I have purchased moto G and Men on 17/03/2015 and am facing an issue in mobile data connection which is getting switched on automatically
 I have complaint regarding same on 29/03/2015 and have followed all the steps instructed and still my concern is not resolved
 Now Lip part expects me to visit a service centre which is not near by and they have clearly DENEID to take the product back or do a exchange or pay back when there is a issue in my mobile
 To friends my question is why should i take a brand new mobile to a service centre to get the confirmation
 Video posted is the proof
 Still they are least gathered to resolve my concern where i never wanted a exchange but only to get my concern resolve and they have completely failed in doing so
 Lip part has made my days worse and disgusting and the customer support OMG they know only one line Please contact service centre
 Os the produced delivered by Lip Part to me is a face one and that the reason i guess they are denying
 It can happen with you make your choice wisely

 The device worked quite well initially as expected
 Installing lollipop, however has brought a lot of pains
 Battery consumption has gone up drastically.
 The phone hangs at times
 Display goes off while twitching between apes for a moment
 There are some andros specific bags took like the alert dont open the pp when the phone is being used
 To you have to mentally open the pp
 Same way when you get a call while using the phone you get the ratification on the top but tapping on it doesn do anything
 I have to lock the screen wait for the normal call reception view to come up and then receive the call
 Also the phone hangs in the middle of continued usage
 In the good side battery consumption while talking to someone is very less speakers are very loud and still clear display quality is good and although the screen is broad the phone is still very handy

 him hardware phone user I used to play os James 3G/Wifi Connectivity 24x7, Pp West etc...I purchased MOTO Os during APP Pale luckily I got it in INR 9899/- os and product delivered to me before time...Flipkart Service is awesome 5/5...now about the phone him using phone from last 10 days without any lag playing games like Shalt os Airbone, Modern Combat os Real Facing os Overkill os Subways Turf Temple Run Oz(on high graphics os Facing etc and believe me game performance is AWESOME on GPU Adreno 305, 450 z Single More games running smoothly but in Modern Combat 5 there is bit lag very low that you canst even notice...I had installed 50+ Pp most of the pp are battery draining pp like KIK, MESSENGER, WECHAT etc then too am getting battery back of 16-18hours using 3G/Wifi Service...TILL NOW os LAG, os BATTERY ISSUES.
 Moto Os camera is doing decent job video quality is perfect no one can get better in this price range
 The only reason him giving 4 star is that cheap accessories Charger(Piece of shit take 4 hours to completely charge 2070mAH battery and worst thing is that if your using phone while charging your phone wont get charged if your using box charger WTF :x), Headphone worst quality I can better headphone is just INR200, and last there is no USB Cable in the BOX.
 NOTE (MUST READ): It the starting i was having battery issue like battery percentage was not accurate like battery percentage get stuck at 80% and remains to 80% for 2-3hours then suddenly drops to 51% ...also battery was draining quickly so i performed some tears to get better battery life ... 1.
 I cleared Ache Partition on my device 2. Calibrated Battery 3. Disabled Google Pp which are of no use
 Now am getting 16-18hours battery backup.
 Sons 1.
 Now Battery only 2070mAh for inch screen 2. 1GB RAM os i need more 3.

 Giving my review after 15 days of use
 Shone specification/look is good - I can give 5 star rating for this
 The problem is battery - I can give 2 star for battery life
 I hope Motorola will give a better battery in future phone
 The worst thing is they are not providing micro USB charging cable to charge it from lawton USB port and they do not have any recommendation to buy any rd party charger also
 Os if you are normal user you may go for it
 But if you are heavy user wife + dual him + 2g/3g), never ever go for it if they are giving free also do not go for it
 By over all rating would be 3 start
 Hello Motorola, please grow up....

 Not my phone in March the phone looked really great with the looks and performance wise but just in 8 days my phone had some 3 weird lines on the display which appears to be the new issue for the phone complained about it as soon as possible and requested for a replacement..as it was a faulty phone from the seller
 To wonder Moto has good features but its always a risk to try it Would have given 5 stars if I didn had to go through this

 Received in time
 worked very fast much faster than my S3.
 however touch screen was not working properly
 Flip-cart had provided me replacement
 New phone works fine with battery touch response
 But touch sensitivity is not consistence in all screen areas / all time
 while strolling long list some time it senses click
 and gives unexpected response
 I never have faced this type of touch problem in my S3.
 otherwise it works great....

 phone hangs twice every day
 you can do anything since you can detach battery
 you just have to keep it aside
 it will take 10 to 15 minutes to get back to normal
 UNTILL THEN YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR CAR os BIKE OUT AND FIND ONE RUPEE COIN PHONE BOOTH. to call if there is anything important
 - That more are you expecting
 Of you were to take my word os NOT BUY IT.
 I was tempted because on couture they compared it with phone 6.
 I thought it has got something
 trust me it does not worth your money
 older seems good

 Great phone
 Using it for almost 3 months
 To problem so far
 Gros : - Fully features phone in 11300 after discount
 - To begging so far - Updated to andros L - Very similar to stock android.
 To bloatware.
 Sons : - I still wish the screen size having 4.5 or 4.7 It would have been perfect phone
 Now a days all good phone having larger screen size
 It took me long time to decide and finally go with os after compromise
 All VFM mobile are more than os or have to go for flagship's mind variant which are too costly

 Only thing it felt out of hand and glass broken
 it say - GORILLA GLASS but actually its not
 It just fell from 4 feet
 And now the moto customer care say the price is around 8000 for display
 It would better to buy a new phone with some more bucks

 I brought new one

 I have used this phone since two months its battery is perfect for 1 day use if u have moderate usage of games
 After loading about about 1.5 go of apes and games still the phone runs smoothly nd perfect
 but some heavy d games the phone heat up
 its charger is really bad one
 it takes 4 hours to charge fully and if u r using simultaneously then it will charge at the same rate that u r using it
 that means practically the battery will remain at constant level
 Next compared to red note go its better in only one way that is its dual-sim, but its the most wanted thing in nowadays honest
 the result of main camera is awsm.
 the do of 15 min will be of 1 by u can imagine the clarity
 front camera of 2 up is satisfactory
 the main advent is u can use multiple users and u get 8 go internal memory for usage
 sound in headphone is moderate
 when its internal memory is below 100 mb it will become slow which happens in all honest
 finally for my usage moto g 2 is better then red note g

 purchased it for Os 10K and after using this for last two days I must say that the stock andros experience is simply great.Comparing Hardware speck it easily beats the similar prices phone hands down.No lag what so ever even though the benchmark is shifting to higher specie least on paper.The build quality is great and the curved back design is superb.Battery lasts a full day on single charge with data on.The only thing lacking is possibly Os conductivity which for me is a non issues as still it is quite far into the future least in my city ,Jammu.This phone has superb Os data rates and for most most of our needs Os is sufficient All in all it is a robust smartphone capable of delivering most of our expectations

 I bought this phone really with lots of expectation about the quality brand value and service provide by motorola.
 OS update is good , display is good no lagging , god sound etc etc but what the use of these features with a drained battery
 Of u switch or gas on and try to find a location it will automatically switch off within 1.5 he even if the battery is 99%.
 and the main part is i kept my phone in front pocket of tight jeans the glasses left cracks wen i tried to lean on a wall i didn expect this quality den was the use of giving gorilla glass 3 which can even handle little pressure on nit.Never thought i will go through this after buying a branded and known companies phone dont want to pay 6000 rubles anymore for it
 which could cost half of my phone..Otherwise they can keep this pathetic service with themselves dont want it anymore.already
 regretting my decision to buy moto g with which so many expectations were bound
 Good bye to Motorola for providing a low quality cheap plastic phone n Flipkart for putting exclusive offers on moto g and shatter or customer dreams by

 Their agents are not unto date and I tried availing discount using VISA debit card but couldn get one
 The reason behind that I should have used mobile pp and their associate have not communicated this to me that means no 10% discount
 The product received has some hardware issues as follows os Distorted speakers os Upon connecting MOTO G 2 to USB 2.0 or 3.0 on a laptop, the screen flicked and becomes too sensitive to access any application on the cell phone
 When registered a replacement request they called me asking to download and install self test pp
 Informed them that I dont have internet or a iii connection on this phone so they denied support and denied replacement of this products
 Everytime they call and ask for internet connection and I keep saying flipcart teach team that I dont have one and they keep schelling a call back for later day
 When I checked today the status of replacement found that "We're sorry
 He are unable to process your replacement request
 Reason : The issue has been resolved between you and the seller
 Hence there will be no replacement or refund ISSUE WAS NOT RESOLVED AND HOW CAN THEY WRITE A COMMENT os ISSUE RESOLVED BETWEEN SELLER AND ME......I HATE FLIPCART and I have told all my friends not to buy any product from flipcart as the return policy is a biggest lie ever.....Bye bye FLOPCART

 First version of review after few hours of purchase
 I gave only 4 stars
 The missing star is for the battery
 West all are perfect
 Motorola should have adjusted the battery rating for bigger display
 they retained the same battery from Moto G (gen1).
 Review updated to 2 stars on 10/April/2015 Sons : (1) Touch Utter : I think I received a faulty device
 The touch is stuttering
 I noticed this when I was strolling down on a webpage that has links
 The stroll movement is often interpreted as a click by moto G2.
 I have moto E must genet
 His never happens on moto Os moto E touch screen always works as per my request
 moto Os does so only half of the time
 I wanted to return the phone but someone pointed that the replacement phone are refurbished ones
 (2) Whipped with ollipop : The speck mentioned the phone to have mitka and will be upgradable to lollipop.
 Line had lollipop out of the box
 I doubt that I got a refurbished one

 I ordered 2 pieces of Moto G and Gen), both received before a weeks
 Thanks for quick delivery to Flipkart, as always
 actually the problems with one piece is it was having yellowish screen & this affecting overall quality of the screen
 if we put both piece together it clearly shows the difference in quality of LCD. because of above issue i have to raise replacement request
 got replacement but unfortunately having same yellowish screen in replacement piece took
 Never expected such scenario from Flipkart or os Details
 His time i have not requested for replacement but little bit disappointed as i have given this to my elder brother & he was very excited for the phone

 I will give five star for this phone if the battery stay for least 12 hours
 Father it stays only for 6-8hrs for normal use itself like emailing, whatsapp, very few calls and without gazing browsing totally useless for people who travelling lot
 whenever i am travelling in the train for just five hours i have to turn off the data reduce the brightness but still battery draining faster
 now 5 months over my charger not working suddenly and i have to find service centre for replacement

 The phone was delivered before time but problems started from the second day itself
 in
 There was a lot of cracking in the audit device and the voice from the other side came with a scratching sound
 iii
 There was some component which was loose inside the phone so much that it used to make a very distinct sound everytime i used the keypad.
 iii
 The network would go off every 30 - 40 seconds into a call
 I called up flipkart and they have replaced it within a week now
 I received the phone today and till now it seems to be working fine except for a little scratching sound every now and then
 I ill write another review after having used it for a weeks

 I received a defect product of Moto G from Flipkart and I am following with them for return or replacement since last 7 days
 I am following on daily basis with them giving false promises that will give you call in next 1-2 business days but still issue is unresolved.
 I have not expected this from Flipkart.
 Very much disappointed

 him not satisfied with the quality of this phone.On the first day itself the battery got dried up and it took 5 hours to get fully charged.My and problem was with the power off button when we click to the power off/on button it gets tilted to one side think in today comparative world if Moto is asking ask phone than it should have least 1.5GB RAM and 13 os primary camera and 5 os secondary...

 I bought this phone and it was delivered within 2 days
 Awesome Shipping Timeline by Flipkart os Stars Coming to the phone Rose Shone is awesome and has all the advanced features that usually any High end phone must have
 To Bags Awesome 16 os Memory Shone is very fast
 Battery lasts 1 and a half Days on a normal usage (Wifi/Whatsapp/Calls) Screen and Camera Clarity is awesome and also has Video SlowMo features
 I am using my Galaxy Os in War handsfree with this phone for music as the one provided with the phone is not great
 A little Equalizer Speaking and the Original Samsung In ear phone can give awesome clarity
 Case VLC Layer from store which is free Sons To USB Cable provided Reduced 1/2 star for this Earphones are not at all great(Reduced 1/2 star for this - I used this after using Samsung Os and the beats and Pass is no way comparable
 Overall a very good phone for the prices

 Motorola has re-launched after being not in market for few years
 They've introduced some new smartphones which are unfordable and competitor to other mobile companies in the market
 I purchased Moto G(2nd Generation for Rs.13000/-.
 It is a great phone with a good price and the touch is really very good
 The phone looks stunning with matt finish cover at the back
 Camera quality is good but rousing takes some time
 Processor is also good snapdragon which is also used by samsung.
 The battery is good but when using the internet the battery drains out quickly
 Normally with data usage on and off the battery remains well
 It is upgrade to android's latest version of lollipop.
 His phone is only available on flipkat.
 A good phone to buy and experience motorola once again other than other bands which are nowadays getting bored

 You canst expect more from Grand than this at such prices
 However I like Samsung phone more
 You have to rely on touch screen only as there not a single physical button except volume up down & lock-power ON/OFF which is not able to wake your screen up incise the phone is hanged
 Not much customization as samson phones.Poor screen brightness
 The good thing is you can clean the screen & body easily

 if i say that this phone is undisputed champion of his league it will be nothing new at it because i think it has left his mark in the market already
 so i would just like to add another recommendation to the kitty of ''Moto G and gen''.
 all the newbie's out there if u are looking for a superb phone with great performance and decent looks @ such a great prices dont give it a second thought and just buy it
 it is more than value for money...!!!! os MOTO....!!!

 Had to return the first unit which was delivered as the battery used to drain within less than 1 he
 Not a replacement from FLIPKART, happy with FLIPKART service
 Again feeling let down the battery need to be charged less than 12 hours if using without any Data usage
 Of connecting to Internet you need to carry a battery back or the phone would be just a paper weight as it drain out in few hours
 To add to the woes network issue had surface network drops and not connecting to WIFI.
 Already confirmed that the network issue is not related to the SIM cards Os is terrible experience...

Anshul Mendhir...
 I have ordered Moto Os from Flipkart on with March got delivery by with March
 Well I think the motorola quality has definitely been deteriorated
 I went ahead to buy this phone despite of recent bad reviews and reviews about the new phone being the refurbished ones
 The first this I checked was the manufacturing date which was March 2015 Os was satisfied with that
 Also it has Android Lollipop as stock ROM installed
 However what follows is the true colors of this device in my first hand experience
 Anyway below are the details of my usage and problems have been facing with this phone - I am using this phone with dual him (that's why they have dual him capability right 1. 100 to os battery drainage in less than 8-9 hours
 By samson s advance with a swollen battery gives me at least 3-4 hours of backup) 2. Shone heat a lot whenever an pp is running
 3. Charger burns metal hot whenever I am charging my phone
 4. A lot of apes keep crashing
 5. Speaker sound cracks on high volumes (shouldn't really be the case for a brand new phone
 Everything is clear now why flipkart is offering a huge discount of 3100Rs on a great in market device
 Other than the above problems I haven faced any issue yet
 Right after posting this review I am going to contact flipkart and ask for a replacement
 Most that if I am not satisfied with the device I am definitely asking for a refund
 I hope it will help you in making a better buying decision
 Based on my current and past experience I definitely would ask users to buy new models and not go for stale models in the market
 His is definitely a bad customer experience flipkart.

 The problem began after I updated it to Android Lollipop.

 His phone has such wonderful specie but I really dont recommend this with Lollipop!

 * Battery draining out too quickly even after disabling most of the Google Pp services
 Even the Battery Waver mode is not helping
 * Sometimes battery charges shows up completed within 15-20 mind
 And while talking the phone immediately dies out
 His creates problems while him travelling
 * Mobile overall performance seems to be affecting as occasional hanging problem or immediate shut-down, causes unwanted shocks
 When at work I tend to lower the sound to Silent & Vibrated
 Once off-work, Turn it back up to High volume
 Still it doesn RING, only vibrated for all the future calls
 Cried twitching it off & back on multiple times
 Didn't help
 Cried setting in-built Ringtones as well
 Same Results

 By experience of moto g and is just dandy
 You must have read phone speck so I am not going to elaborate .
 phone performance is lag free .
 but yes sometimes screen doesn response on phone calls and it is difficult to attend the phone I dont know if the problem is only in my phone
 U wont believe I dropped the phone from and floor and its still alive in good condition just a micro crack on the corner of the screen .
 I am satisfied

 I have bought this product with 2 good offers which saves me 3300 os from MRP.. Yes I bought this product for 9900 rs...
 After using this for a weeks Were is my review about the mobile 1. Good build quality Feels good and premium in hands but little slippery
 You might need some good back cases
 2. Latest Lollipop update and stock andros experience
 I am loving it
 In fact everyone will love this experience
 3. os screen has more situation than any other phone in this price segment
 You wont get disappointed , Touchscreen has good response and battery smooth 'THE BEST' 4. Battery back - os type... you can expect a full day battery back with only calls essaying and some time of whatsapp or other messenger...
 Of you are a core-user, then you definitely need a second time of charging in a day 5. RAM - 1GB is enough for average user but you will feel some laws then and there while playing high end games and using many apps(more than 6 or os at a time due to less clock speed of the processor (1.2 GHz) 6. Speakers - Good Charging takes time to get full
 7. Overall experience : For average users and users looking for clarity of screen and andros experience - "BEST in this price segment For core users like users need a mobile for gaming - Please look for a mobile which has more than 1.5 os of RAM... egg U Yureka, Xiaomi etc 8.
 I am satisfied ... North for 10K according to my expectation Still it needs some improvement

 I called flipkart for a replacement but they REFUSED and asked me to visit service center According to Flifkart 30 days replacement policy my product should have been replaced but they refused to do so am extremely unhappy with the customer support provided to me by flipkart if they continue to do so i would strongly discourage shopping from flipkart.

 Moto G and generation is almost close to perfection with all the shortcomings of Moto G st generation addressed.However the few things I dont like about the phone is 1.The Pathetic Battery life The battery should be at least 2500mAH.
 2.Unable to set photos from facebook to contact list
 3.The drop down menu has got lesser keys
 4.You have to press at least three keys to activate or activate the data connection
 5.The bells could have been minimize a bit
 For the rest as I have said close to perfection think the price should now come down from the original Os 12990/

 I am very much excited before purchasing this device
 After 3-4 usage i found that the battery does not last even half a day
 I have charged 100% in morning and by the evening at 5-6pm , the battery drains out completely
 Motorola is a trusted Grand Everything is perfect in this phone except for the battery
 I am very disappointed with the battery life
 I give 5 star to the andros Lollipop.
 It is very user friendly and easy to go through
 To battery i give 0 start even Chinese phone have better battery
 Of you need better battery simply go for a Micromax into or Foka Gumma 730.

 Well the phone offers 16GB internal storage which is fantastic
 The phone lacks in good quality front camera
 When I bought this phone it was lowered by Andriod 4.4.4
 however after dating to Android 5.0 it sort of sucks
 I mean the phone gets hanged quite frequently the apes dont work smoothly the pattern lock refuse to recognize your pattern and few other minor bags occur
 The reason I rate it 4 stars is that I dont think that there are any hardware issues
 Probably it is an issue with Android 5 only

 i used moto go last 4 months.here
 in explaining why we buy and dont buy os y we buy camera quality is best at day time
 up is gave good quality pick
 screen resolution is good.touch is very smooth and sexy.we
 can play games with out suck in middle level graphics settings.mobile
 design is unique and good quality
 pure andros give a different experience processor and graphics processor is very good performance Why dont buy.... dont had 1080p video recording.taking
 3 hours for charging and cheap quality head phones,charger,battery drying very fast every 10 mint 1 percent battery increasing in standby.
 Officially it was moto g2.But we can say it as room heater,iron box,water heater,suicide weapon..if we use 10 mints for call , camera , net , games etc it become a burned irons
 we should use tireless headset.
 not suitable for series in night.price is also high because of moto brand os we can get min 5 to 15 percent discount on any smart phone in outside markets
 commerce seller r selling on MRP prices
 great battery capacity 2070.for
 extend battery life one trick is just select power off by understanding of Motorola suggestions thank to flipkart for fast delivery

 i am impressed with the device at many printers like Display Size , Clarity , Easy To use system , All Quality , Camera , Os etc the things that i am not liking are Display is a bit yellowish not completely white , Battery runs out to 40 % by evening she is back from office just with normal usage of the phone a window 8.1 or 10 os in the same device would definitely let me buy 1 for self i am not a fan of Android any given day

Mohanakrishnan...
 I am writing this review after 1 month of using the device
 Am not going to detail the specification it is given in the product description on the webster
 His is a very impressive mid range smartphone and it comes with andros version lollipop 5.0.2 on the box.This is one of the few phone with the lollipop on the box
 Packaging is very nice and accessories given in the box are also very handy
 Performance of the phone is very good with battery life lasting a little more than a whole day with complete services such as location wife data etc being used os
 The interface is so fluid and is a delight to use the phone
 Camera quality is very good for daylight photography however low light and night photos have a lot of noise and doesn come out very great because of the flash not being bright enough
 Also disappointed with the fact that there is no mode selection in the camera such as portrait sports etc
 All quality and video playback quality is very good
 The battery does take a slightly longer than usual time to be fully charged but as I said earlier battery life is very good
 USB OTG works very well however with the support of a third party file manager pp
 Shone occasionally does hang when trying to retrieve old files etc and sometimes has a problem to receive 3G/ Edge data signal
 Display and sound quality is also amazing with the dual speakers
 Packaging was excellent by Flipkart and delivered before time by seller os Details
 Oats off to you guys!!
 Only wish there were more colours available other than just black and white
 Moto however does sell back panel and lip covers in various colours
 Highly recommend this phone to a mid range user and buds to Motorola Nobility

 Not the mobile delivered on December
 The delivery was prompt and was delivered in 1 day
 But the product is NOT good
 I am facing issues with the phone within 1.5 months of buying
 It was not getting charged and was not twitching on
 The Moto service center people told me that there is a very minute edge in the charging pin that has been cut and needs to be replaced
 But Moto does not replace the charging In alone and the entire Motherboard needs to be replaced
 the Most is Rs.8000.
 His is not covered in warranty because this issue is being considered as a physical damaged
 ( Not sure why this is so
 8000Rs for issue with the charging In alone
 and the phone itself cost 12999.
 Totally Unhappy and the Flipkart is also non cooperative as the time has crossed 30 days from purchase
 its been more than 30 days since this issue started and have also called up Moto support , but no one seems to be assisting in resolving this
 Totally unhappy with this product and service of Both Moto and flipkart.

 But of all the phone I saw online I regret buying this one
 I believe its FAKE.
 There is NOTHING good about this phone except that fact that it has a wide screen and a swift OS. 1.
 The charger is a 2 pin charger which HEATS os EACH TIME I charge it
 It gets so hot that you canst even touch it
 2. The phone within 2 days of buying STARTED GETTING HOT when on calls
 I fail to understand how 3. os USB PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE PHONE.
 Now am I supposed to connect my phone to the computer
 4. Untidy packing
 Really bad
 Please os NOT buy this phone
 I had clot of expectations with this phone but what real is real
 Thanks

 its pretty smooth and faster and Keyboard sensitivity is amazing
 Love its high definition image capturing by 8 os rear end camera with LED Clash
 And love the fact that it had got Android 5.0.2 pre installed during the replacement
 The vibration mode is damn good even when phone sound is in silence mode
 It even heavily vibrated in my pocket when kept in silent mode
 Thanks Flipkart, W.S. Detail & part logistics for such a great product and for timely replacing the old Moto G and Men with this new one

 I bought this phone when flipkart gave a discount through their pp of Os 2000.
 The phone was available for Os 10999, and I bought a 6600 may power bank along with it
 I have been using the phone for two days
 I got this product one day before the expected date but the package through which flipkart sent it was not impressive
 There was only sash of bubble wrap inside and that too was running everywhere except being attached to the packet of the phone
 Thankfully the phone turned out to be okay so I guess I can deal with it
 Body Its very simple yet has a premium look
 The been around the screen is not the thinness Especially in the top mainly to give room to the sterno speakers yet the phone is surprisingly unable by one hand despite having a 5 inch screen
 The back isn glossy so no need to worry about fingerprints.
 However sometimes the phone felt a little slippery and the volume rocket and the power button nobles a bit
 Its not like its going to come out daytime but it does
 Motorola should have done better here
 Screen I have no idea how they managed to put such a good display inside a low budget phone like this
 Yes its not full os (720p, not 1080) but believe me I have seen full os screened phone giving a worse display performance
 Ambient light senior works like a charm
 To matter where you go it adjust the brightness for you perfectly
 It has wide view angles and the screen is very much view-able at bright sunlight so no issues there
 The touch responsiveness is good enough to be satisfied
 I have no intention for a scratch test of the Gorilla Glass 3 that they provided but the feel was quite good
 Unfortunately the day I got it there was a heavy rain while I was outside with the phone It was in my pocket but the whole trouser got soaked yet nothing happened with the phone so I would say the water resistant claim is valid took
 Software and Performance The phone comes with a Mitka but for the very first time you switch it on it will give you a prompt if you want to upgrade
 Of you select yes you can use lollipop from the very beginning
 The overall operation is quite smooth but the phone does face a little lag while playing the transition animation from the apes menu while returning to the home screen
 Though I think this is a problem of the software and can be fixed with an updated
 Loading of the casual games were really fast
 Although while multitasking maybe keeping 3 or 4 apes open at the same I did face a little lag here and there for a short moment
 I was playing Subways Suffers so it was not expected
 Haven't played any heavy games yet when I do all update the review
 Camera Motorola has a reputation that their phone camera are not good
 Well the camera of moto G and genu is an exception
 Its snapshots are very nice even the front camera which is only 2MP can surprise you sometimes
 It does struggle when the light is low but which camera doesn't, right
 I thought it was good enough there took
 Connectivity- The wife and bluetooth had no problem and the performance was seamless.
 But While connecting through the USB I did face some issues
 First of all THE PACKAGE DOESN'T HAVE A USB CABLE INSIDE That bad thing would have happened if they provided a charger with a removable data cable I wonder so be ready to buy one along with the phone
 Next All of the data cable dont work on this phone
 While buying choose a wired data cable in stead of a two wired one (Can't write details here space is limited
 Battery The battery back is indeed low
 It wont last a full day with moderate/heavy usage
 Although to compensate that I bought a small 6600 may power bank so dont have that problem anymore
 To summarize the pro and Sons Rose Value for money Excellent Looks Beautiful Display Recent performance Unless you load it up with 5-6 apes running simultaneously Lollipop Upgrade Very good camera Sons Video call not available An be done through third party apes like type but not possible directly To USB cable sometimes data cable might dispatch and although charging internal storage wont be shown in os Headphone provided isn good Speaker volume is not very high sound quality good enough though Volume rocket and power button nobles a bit could have done better Battery Lockup not decent Will increase fairly once upgrade to lollipop) Takes long time to charge (Don't use your phone while charging that will lessen it The sons do have a way of compensation so to me overall a fantastic phone considering the budget
 Going to give it 4 stars and would definitely recommend others to buy this when someone wants a brand with decent performance but has a problem with budget

 give been using it from 3 days and i can say the phone is good for its price there is some heating while using wife and some intense gaming but not too much games are running good back camera which is 8 megapixel satisfies but i have little disappointment with the front facing camera built quality is great for its price display is too good which i did not expected battery back is not too good but satisfies a normal user by conclusion i would say the buyer will be satisfied by the overall performance of the phone

 Rose The phone has very easy and convenient User Interface and is very fast
 There are no laws whatsoever
 Its just three days old so it may be too early to say
 The camera quality is great and display is very good
 Sons Terrible battery life
 The phone is hardly three days old but I have to charge it twice a day
 Plus the touch pad is of very poor quality
 While tying some of the keys on the touch keyboard doesn respond

 Delivered 2 days earlier in good condition
 Pretty fast browsing
 By findings os Plug the charging pin to mobile and plug the charger to mains
 Once the mobile hung by showing battery fully charged but when you switch off the charger its only 58%.
 I need to restarted
 os Battery condition is 82%, while video recording in HDR mode at about 5 mind recording the mobile went hot and video on capture was jerking for every 2 seconds
 os With It kate favorite calls killed instantaneously
 After toll pop updated favorite calls dial-up a bit later
 Part from the above its quite a good mobile worth for the money

Karthik Rajagopal
 Initially was happy with this phone
 Os soon as I updated to Lollypop the phone was as slow as sea turtle on And
 It wont even handle multiple apes properly
 I guess its the Lollypop which has a huge memory leak issue
 After using it for 2.5 months I sold it for sky
 Of I had realized it earlier I would give given it back to flipkart and would not have suffered losses
 For a smartphone, its not about the processor the RAM or any speck on paper
 Its how fluid the phone feels while using it
 4 years old shone os feels better
 I guess , i will go for a Oneplus One or shone os

 Must go for it
 I experienced the service of Motorola.
 Its very nice
 West product in range
 I bought Moto G st generation 6-7 months back and now on 31/03/2015 I bought Moto G and Generation
 I am always overwhelmed for Motorola Grand
 And I am now planning to buy coming Moto G g version
 And I am also waiting for Motorola Cab with Os or Os facility if they launch
 Never Doubt about the product Moto G as well as Motorola.

 Sorry to edit this review as early there was an issue of the RAM but now phone Touch pad and screen stopped working so facing problem with the service center and leaving with no phone to use now a days also an availability of the spares is also a problems
 I hope this problem is regarding this specific hands only
 phone hangs a bit while playing high graphics games like Real racing os the suspect may be a RAM with capacity of 1GB, a 1.5GB or 2GB RAM would have done justice to this

 I bought it by looking at some good reviews in market,but really telling you dont even think to buy this phone st of all as the phone is available only on flipkart so its a kind of monopoly kind of thing due which you will not get good service with so much discussions I replaced my phone with flipkart and the and set was also having multiple issues I think flipkart is just selling low quality products now a days built battery is another bad features battery charges very slowly and dip down suddenly
 Voice quality of phone is so bad even on normal calling pp around you can clearly listen your call
 overall its a very low quality phone ultimately I had to sell it at very low prices

 Its a good buy keeping in mind its price and the brand value of Motorola.
 However one should buy this mobile only if your sure that you have a service centre anywhere near your place
 You may not have to make regular trips to the service centre except if your facing issues with battery and charging in general
 6 months after buying this mobile it showed problems with charging
 It want getting charged
 The flipkart people made it their responsibility to get the phone to work properly and deliver it to me again after servicing.
 Great job flipkart.
 The causes of my charging issues not using motorola charge draining the entire battery before putting in charge overnight charging
 Please avoid these mistakes if you wish any of your mobile to work normally
 His motorola model is great otherwise
 Its a device for keeps

 His phone is a total beast
 After 24 his of usage Touch-Super Sensitive Camera-Average UI- West (Stock){{Lollipop!}} James Awesome os Battery-Ok The battery is the part which concerns me a lot
 His phone can only last for 3-4 his when gazing
 U for an average user(casual gazing 2-3 his of calling 3G) it can last for more than a day
 The phone does not heat while doing any work or gazing
 The power save can be helpful when in emergency
 Of you are an andros lover go for it
 THIS os THE BEST PHONE AVAILABLE os THE MARKET FOR THIS PRICE RANGE

 First of all I want to thank Flipkart for 2000 flat discount during Web 23 to 25.
 It was best deal in 11k.
 I would have never gone for it paying 13K as I could get more or less similar features under 10K.
 But I could still not get Lollypop with any other brandy
 Rose Camera Round OS, Sure Andriod Sons Battery is big turn off
 Other issue is is the 1GB Os data offered by Airtel.
 Bier Flipkart nor Hittel let me connect their customer service and provide the details.This is why I would give 4 starts out of 5.

 Once i got the mobile i had updated to Lollipop version OS.
 Once after dating the OS mobile starts to hang
 The apes start to close while working
 It had been for Two days this problem persists and mobile is too slowly
 To i request the replacement of mobile
 They had replaced the mobile but the replaced mobile is too bad then the old mobile
 The mobile has power issues Once the power is switched off it canst be switched on and the battery back up is too bad When i service my mobile from service center and now it is working fine...
 All Features in this mobile are good Battery back is too pathetic

 I ordered Moto G on the with of September
 I was pleasantly surprised to receive it on the with of September with normal shipping
 Full marks for the buying experience
 The performance was acceptable and all was well for 4-5 months
 Accidently my charging slot happens to get damaged by me
 That normal people will think its charging slot not a big issue
 Easy replacement
 To chance
 The Motorola service Centre said that as charging slot is directly connected to the motherboard need to change whole motherboard.
 I was shocked!!!!
 And as charging slot damage is considered as Physical damage replacement of motherboard do not get counted in warranty period
 The price they said to replace is k for ask mobile More than half of original
 And I think most of the people dont know that charging slot damage affects that much amount
 In Mind its like Rhode (Horse) i nail horse shoes karay ho gay to pure good hi basal replaced daalo”.
 Other customers I suggest you to think before purchase
 wont make a mistake that I made
 I have decided to throw the phone and get another one Not Moto).
 Why Oz I know at least other phone charging shots does not charge this much amount
 To here me saying I and Goodby to the only Moto product I will ever own

 His review is meant for flipkart delivery not for Motorola G features
 I had ordered Moto G (G2) on 24 March on flipkart pp which had one offer as particular discount that day and I got 27 March as expected date of product arrival .
 After purchasing phone , status of order moved to your product has been confirmed In with march I received a call from flipkart customer care asking about confirmation of product it was a COD!) and he assured me , I will be mostly getting my phone by today and worse at tomorrow
 In with (27 is expected date promised by flipkart) still status was same so I called its customer care services and escalated.
 Today (30 March ) finally i received my phone
 I wanted to ask the reason behind this poor delivery .
 Of any product is out of stock please dont promise us and that too in case of phone(one week i was without any communication with outer world
 Of u promise , value your words
 Wont force us to search for a substitute for u .
 Hope flipkart team will understand and improvised on it

 I am someone who is the user of Motorola-G2 .
 Recently in month of January 2015 I had ordered moto-g2 online from flipkart.
 I received the telephone on must of An 2015.
 In the must day from date of receipt my cell was facing touch screen issues
 The touch screen started getting hanged automatically and i had to wait for around 10 odd minutes for it to work in the normal condition
 Sometimes it used to get hanged in such a way that i just could not use my cell phone for couple of hours.Since it was the must day hence i approached flipkart and asked for a replacement but they told we cannot replace it since it was the must day as per their Policy
 May 1 : .
 Finally was per flipkart , on rd March as my telephone was in warranty period and as I trusted after sales services of Motorola I thought to give it to authorized service center near to my location
 To I approached service center of Motorola in Lumbar Address : B2X Service Centre , Dadar, Mumbai).
 I gave my phone to the counter and they said that " the touch screen and display will be changed and it will take 10 days
 May 18 : I tried calling the service centre several times but no one picked up the call the email sent to the service centre went unanswered.Hence finally i called up motorola customer care and i was being told that the cell phone is ready for pick up.Hence i went all the way to the service centre and to my surprise i was being told that the cell phone has not being repaired and will take 3 more days
 May 20 : Finally i called up motorola , marked a mail to the customer care id on word March 2015 regarding the delay
 You can check or email records in the system was being told to wait for one week Today May 25 : I am really disappointed its just been 2 months i have taken a motorola phone out of which one month its i could not use it and it is with the service centre
 I have just wasted one full month due to motorola's bad customer sales service
 By question is what is the use of writing in big word "12 MONTHS WARRANTY".
 That if I say that Motorola cell phone are losing their quality and using cheap equipment and finally Flipkart losing out their brand and their policy
 Seems like I am stupid and visited the authorized service center
 Does it take 20 days or more just to replace a part ????
 I expect Flipkart to keep up their reputation and trust by replacing the defective piece as it comes fully under 100% warranty
 Flipkart...plzz wake up ???

 Awesome phone
 All goose apes are integrated so seamlessly!! Not of advantages on apes like Caps and Drive integrated into stock as compared to the same download for my pre Samsung S2.
 Not lollipop took Initially had problems with him card and memory card getting disconnected frequently
 Service center guns said sim-memory-card-tray was faulty and replaced within warranty
 Works fearlessly since then
 Highly recommended phone Was some apes that I think are bloatware icon I dont use them but I feel the bloatware is less compared to Samsung! Thanks Moto!!

 I guess I have to go long with this co am so in love with this device
 1. Excellent package and fast delivery from flipkart.
 Ordered it on saturday night and got it on monday morning
 wonderful work guns
 2. Everyone has been complaining about battery issues I dont find any issues with mine
 It does give around 9-10 hours of usage using wife
 I guess that is enough for me
 3. Smooth fast and clean UI.
 To additional tags or apply
 Moved it
 4. Good camera quality
 I loved the camera quality especially the back cam which gives outstanding picture quality in absent light conditions
 5.
 The dual front speakers are really a gift
 I could now play songs and not worry to keep the phone screen facing the table
 Sons 1. Would have had a better headphone with the device as the default one doesn have much effect
 2. Charging using the default charger is something that I wish I wouldn have to do as it takes unto his to charge from os to 100%

 Dear Flipkart, I have ordered Moto g on flipkart on 24 March 2015.
 first i have notified that my order will receive on with march
 but after 2 days they told me there is a delay in order
 on 29 march i received sums that your product is out for delivery...and it will be delivered before 7 pmb
 To i was waiting for it
 but it doesn come
 so i traced it on site this time they are showing delivery unsuccessful
 this is totally ridicule
 Of you are not able to deliver it then why you send sms??? Flipkart has lost all its credibility as fast delivery
 They are overlooking on orders without taking care of deliveries.

 Excellent phone
 To heating issues
 Stock Android has a few issues here and there but manageable.
 However one issue is that when the mobile is being used continuously with a single hand the weight of the mobile grows on you
 By hands start gaining after 10 or 15 mind
 Other than that no worries
 Have purchased the PNY 10400mAH power bank for this mobile
 Charges my mobile least 4 times and that too very fast
 Also got the sands 32GB class 10 micro cards
 Have not loaded anything to it yet but seems to be working fine
 Satisfied with the flipkart delivery as well
 Received in 2 days

 i have used these phone for 2 months or so and found the following things Gros 1. Lollipop 2. Camera Sons 1. Elastic finish feels very bad like a toy in hand....don't go with it for looks 2. Hangs even in playing average games
 3. Worst battery drops down to empty with below average use in 8 his 4. Round clarity is worse like hell......can't play in front of friends 5. War better phone available at these price

 To have been using this phone for roughly 6 months now and it has been a great phone
 I have come from a Nexus 4 and it is and upgrade in some aspects while a slight downgrade in others
 To starting my review PROS Usual Speakers Superb lovely heavenly sounds compared to the Nexus os -Camera: In par with the Nexus os Great screen size It didn take me long to get used to it and once I did him now a fan High build quality Really coming from a Os and definitely pick this quality sturdy feels great in the hand
 Battery life Gives me approximately an hour more of screen on time as compared to the nexus os overall and say a 20% improvement(lasts a day easily with medium to heavy use -SDCard: HUGE prominent for buying the Moto G2. After market support Several ROMs available
 -OTG Support Plug in USBs, houses keyboard gamepads.
 CONS 1. RAM: Felt that the ram(1GB) was a bit low for a new device however there is no compromise on the performance.(There
 is however memory leak which is to be supposedly fixed in the 5.1 updated 2. Non-removable battery and always like the option to pop a new battery in Os 4 and a half stars
 To I guess that it the pro to con ratio is in favor of buying the Moto G(2nd genu Os Hoped this review helped

Anshuman Deshp...
 First of all hats off to flipkart's delivery service I placed order and got within couple of days
 The smartphone sports a large display which enhanced the experience to watch video
 Also you get free Lollipop update for moto go
 The only thing I feel is it should have at least 2 os RAM.
 Currently supported RAM is fabulous while using a couple of apes at a time however if you wish to use multiple heavy apply this device under performed
 Sometimes due to overloaded the apes are forceful closed automatically which is annoying

{
Shakthidar H B
 Was confused between this and Xiaomi Honest
 But the build quality reliability and the bloatware free product made me choose this
 The product is very good
 Earphone is very cheap and of poor quality
 But there are much better phone at lower price than this
 like U Yureka, Novo etc To your research before buying

 First of all pp I we share my experience with you about buying an electronic device from Flipkart.
 Of the seller is os retail than products are 100% genuine but if you are buying from any other retainers you may need to he in touch with the service center to confirm whether its a registered product with the company or notes there are too many fraudulent activities happening in the market of smart phone these daya..
 I had been using Moto e for last 8 months recently upgrade to Moto G2...I love this phone as it has got almost everything you need 1 thing I would like to mention here what I experienced with this phone is
 When you upgrade it to 5.0 you may feel a leg in opening apes and may feel that device is running slowly
 All u need to do is to back up your phone and than do factory data reset... Now when your phone is up you ll notice that the processing speed is just doubled up
 And it will work absolutely fine Other thing the moto should upgrade in this phone is to provide battery and charger of higher rating as the charger takes hell lot of time to finish chagrin and 2070 may battery is insufficient for a smart phone like this
 Shone has good audit quality but headphones are pathetic
 It gives a feeling of headphones in 2001-2005.

SANDEEP ATHILI
 I have Purchased the Shone on dated 5-02-2015, but unfortunately phone slipped into the water on dated 9-03-2015, Due the built battery of the phone we are unable to dry it immediately and service center in very far from my place we are unable to take to os on same day on next day I have taken to os of MOTO, he has take 300 os to check the phone and told it will not work and waste to invest the money on the phone to repair as I have purchased it for 12999 RS. it is very painful situation for me as phone is not working within the month only
 (MY ADVICE os NOT PURCHASE MOTO PHONES os ALL ARE INBUILT BATTERY ONLY) and no local service centers cannot help the phone as it is unique design

 **8MP camera takes amazing pictures
 **Screen is bright and vivid
 bones os There were no bones in the device whatsoever but the charger shipped with this phone heat up like a often rocky
 ****The wall charging unit provided by Moto is heating like anything
 **And battery performance is average
 **Requires too much time for charging

 I bought this phone in december 2014.
 till now it has not shown any problems and running fine but the battery life is a had wearisome if you are using internet continuously and playing average graphics games
 Camera is just awesome and the audit quality is also very good
 Sometimes it hangs but i think that is boy of installation of too many apply
 Os in short go for this and it is a best budget phone under 15k.

 Opens are good in this price band
 Battery draining is a major issue which can be fixed by Motorola, if they want

 There are so many defects with this phone..I recommend Front purchase this bull shit phone phone is hanging each and every time..(2/10) battery back is worst.(2/10)

 finally my bill is not a valid one
 went to service center,They told that your bill also not a valid one os feeling helpless (0/10) Regarding this i gave many complaints to Flipkart..They did not solve my complaints and they blocked me and they are not responding for any complaints recommend every one not to purchase from bullshit Flipkart.Worst support from flipkart..I dont want to purchase any thing from flipkart..

 MOTO Os rocks in every hemisphere
 Performance of Snapdragon processor so smooth that you wouldn feel it has a 1GB RAM.
 Almost all the games are promising good.Build is also quite solid.And the best part is that you can use this phone single handedly.
 His phone give me a very firm hold on it even though it is a os inches

 I have bought a moto go on exchange during the recent offer....I seriously feel the product delivered to me is Defective one after comparing it with it with people having the same phone
 os the back cover is defective one because it lacks finishing & it blocks my finger from the clock button
 2)The new phone had Mitka 4.4.4
 installed in it which gave me a lot of force close issues.....specially the contact book dint open many a times.After upbraiding the phone to Lollipop the phone was something worth using but still had force close issues
 3)The battery takes so long to charge up....i have handled many top model phone with large battery life,but none took such long hours to charge up the entire phone
 Hence,i am going for a quick replacement as soon as possible

 Great display good call sound quality loud ringtone, but he menu is not as sick or user friendly like samsung.
 The camera quality is poor forget about indoor photo
 Even outside it is very very average compared to Apple / Samsung.
 Moto better improve this else it will soon lose out to the bigger with better camera
 Prices at 12k, Semi is definitely a better bet

 I wont get into the in depth review of this phone everyone knows the speck and the technology on it.Moto have managed to keep the OS as close to stock Android as they can which is something is love about the phone
 Motorola's build quality is the best as ever , have been using this phone for a long time now and it hasn troubled me yet
 Everything on this phone right from the screen to the camera to the sound quality to the battery smooth OS to the build quality claims itself the KING of its price segment for me

 he said my phone board has gone and he is telling different amount for the mother board at different time
 contracted motorola.they
 were not ready to say its board price..that made me really in a difficult situation..i buyer moto go 4 months back from flipkart.com..even though i felt the phone was good in the beginning...battery life of the phone was very poor and sometimes when someone calls its sound stop suddenly..when phone start the problem will be solved..fro my experience i am saying not to buy this phone..when it get damaged accidently..you have to forget that mobile for ever

 I bought this phone last December and it left me with great impact
 But unfortunately last week my mobile was pick-pocketed in the market
 Now him back to square again
 I started to search online again and thought to try my hands on a similar kind of product but not this again
 But every time I compare this phone to name a few HTC 620G DS, Samsung Galaxy Os Leo even Grand 2 etc
 I was surprised to notice that this phone has got far superior quality in all aspect
 It has got Cornila glass 3 Os hate plastic covered screen Pictures are good video is outstanding sound quality is perfect with dual speaker body cover is unique and not slippery battery is decent it works through out a day
 Most impressive part is it does not get heat when you video call over Skype, I do that for more than an hour and it is as cool as it looks which also surpassed all the expensive features honest
 All games are suitable no lagging
 And lets not forget it has got a latest Android L which gives you a feeling of being a step ahead than the rest
 The only problem is that it takes longer time to get charged in original charger but that negotiable... Guess what have already ordered this phone again and it should be delivered within a few days

 Door battery performance , but Flipkart rejected the request for refund
 I got the replacement earlier and experienced the battery issue again
 His time they rejected the request to refund replacement second time since their technical executive concluded that phone is working fine as per their troubleshooting.
 You will be left disappointed as these days flipkart customer care services have become pathetic
 They will play around with you for sometime and have their customer care call you back with same responses all over
 You write all kinds of mails complaining about the product and they write same non sense all over
 They are really turning to be unreliable.
 Please be careful while purchasing products like these if luck is never on your side
 I have decided to not pursue any other product on their webster post the blunt responses they have given
 Wish you good luck os =========================================================== Battery issue within 3 days of use ( First review All other reviews suggest this phone is good
 the look and feel is great and so many features look nice
 SAR value can be of concern but for me the Battery has caused problems
 Must bought the phone last week and its not been a week since use the battery begins to drain at faster pace
 The battery indication shows 100% on full charge in morning 70 % post 3 hours with the phone used just for calls .
 When the phone is kept completely idle with no application running no 3G-Wi-Fi, GPS os etc the battery still drains at the rate of os every 1-2 minutes
 But for a moment it suddenly drained 5 % in one short
 this is really puzzling and on direct communication with Motorola assist team they say to do cache-wipe and factory rest to see if battery is resolved
 that not advisable since there is data loss
 I can anticipate this issue to be there in future and guidance given by Motorola customer care is also funny
 I am in attempt to see if there is any service center who can help yet with past experiences I can say they will come up with same response as what Motorola did
 Honestly the phone looks good but battery is really a turn-off.
 I hope the Flipkart authorities inspect their inventor correctly to see all products are tried and tested before selling off
 I hope a replacement fetched a good piece

 the hands get heated if you use petit heat like you can hole on your hand

 Rose Assured Lollipop update over mitka made phone more smoother
 Real feel on hand
 Speakers are very good with crystal clear sound
 Battery is decent and runs for nearly 12-14 hours with average use
 Automatic brightness adjustment indoor and outdoor
 West camera at day light condition
 Real protection by morning Gorilla Glass
 Happy playing Subways suffers Temple Run 2 and Will climb racing
 Good customer care service
 Sons Am is 1 go which sometimes may give feeling of last
 Earphones provided are too bad as no sound proof
 Full charging takes a bit long time
 Pain camera does not click good pictures at night
 Price is bit too high as competitors with same specification is available in market within 10k.
 Os a customers I am happy and satisfied with my phone

 you need to leave your phone to service center @ 15- 20 days

 To far I have used Nokia, BB, Samsung, Micromax, HTC, Bony phone and now its motor and Men 16 GB... Nothing better than this
 its a worth purchase in 12999 Good luck in your search for a smart phone

{
Prakash KP
 I dont understand why people called it as Smart phone
 Unfortunately I brought this in a hurry as my phone was crashing
 You need to carry a charger along with you as you see in the ad CHARGING... CHARGING... Battery reduces by os per minute on 3G.
 It takes more than his to charge 100% using box piece charge around 6-8hrs to charge using USB.
 It times it gets extremely hot by itself even in stand by mode
 Sometime I feel scared to go near fearing a burst anytime.
 You can use it for a hot massage

 hello flipkart, i am satisfied by the product and its quality i will be glad to refer to my friends who are looking for online purchase fast and easy
 But i saw the specification and studied hard enough and made the decision on buying this product moto g ( second generation os
 I bought this mobile by my first salary and as i received the set i realize it had only 11.48GB left for me to use as i had ordered for 16 os moto G ( All software installed takes only 1 os Space os
 I am a office person with lots of download and had to buy another 8 os memory card Also its front camera is os at day time at night time pipes of self gets scattered ( just as of 0.2 up camera so front camera sucks
 Dear is good for 8 may

 Dear reviewers, All Android mobile having below 3000 may are having below average battery life
 He have to be content with only showing and messaging.
 Playing games and surging net using blue tooth and hearing/viewing songs/movies swallow most of the battery power and one will have to charge twice per day;For nominal users this mobile is a boon and for voracious net and game users I recommend Pioneer Os which has 5000 may lowered battery

 In initial phase after purchase I was surprised by the quality and performance of the products
 It never gets handed while playing games online video or any other applications
 There are some reviews that Moto and Men is being hot while playing games or online video but in my case it is not happened
 I recommended same mobile to many of friends
 Full Marks to Moto G and Gen).

 I bought this phone 4 months back immediately after buying within 2 - 3 days having issues with phone on voice quality and not getting sounds on phone reported the issue to flipkart.
 They wanted me to do some checks it fixed the issue for time being again after a month i am having continuous issues with phone had issues with display similar issue with ratification and sounds started Now the device is not getting charged and completely the phone is dead
 When i contracted Flipkart they wants me to contact Motorola Service Centre day after delivering me a faulty product they want me to roam around the service centre which is not at all fair From day one after buying this phone i am having hell a lot of issues
 Request you not to buy this phone
 It is not worth for money and not worth to buy online a faulty products

 The mobile is worth its price especially with dating to Lollipop (eventhough there was a considerable waiting period whereas other phone are yet to update their versions.This is pretty good value for money at ask from Flipkart).
 It has a decent processor good display and an average camera
 But battery life leaves much to be desired gets drained a little early than you would expect
 Still can stand one day with pretty good use
 Anyway Buds to Moto and Flipkart for making this moto boy budget friendly in Indian

 Impressive smartphone The MOTO G improves on what its OLD MOTO G lacked micro os card slot,beautiful os inch display and 8MP camera .
 Gros -5" display front speakers are loud n clear no network or call drops -8MP camera takes amazing pictures when HDR mode is on micro os slot up to 32gb bones Battery performance is average
 -Charger is not us type u have to buy pp connection to connect with put
 there were no bones in the device whatsoever with this phone
 I THINK MOTO MUST GIVE 1.7GHZ INSTEAD os 1.2 The Qualcomm Had More Processor

 I got the product for a price of 11,700/- and after a months use these are my findings - Excellent front speakers and display
 - Front cam is doing a really great job
 - Dear cam is good and the pick look great when seen on phone but when you transfer it to a os the pick dont look that good
 - Touch response is very good
 - The phone seems to be water and "SNOW" resistant to a great extent
 Such like my good old Moto Defy :-) - 1GB RAM is actually not sufficient while playing high-end games
 Otherwise its doing a great job
 To lag whatsoever
 - The backcover is pretty cool and the overall product design and feel is very good
 The Build quality is great took
 To other than the go ram and the not so good rear cam this phone wins hands down
 Moving the MOTO Os !

 Thanks to FLIPKART, they delivered this product within the specified time
 Neatly packed without any damage done to the piece
 I was One of the first few customers to receive this handset.
 Thank you so much Flipkart.
 I am using this phone for around 4 months here is what i found after usage Pros:- Superb screen size Camera quality is far good compared to many phone in this budget
 >Android 5.0 runs smoothly without any last
 Speaker is good no cranks noise even if u increase the volume
 It candles 720p and slow 720p shots extremely well
 > Expandable memory and built memory are a charm
 Cons:- Battery back is the main issue P.S- get or self a portable charger if or a aid music listeners game etc battery back is only for 7-8 his wid heavy usage Os little heating on the back while running too many applications
 > Oats up quite a lot of ram sometimes
 Conclusion A very good descent phone with good specie
 I dont have too much of a problem only if the battery thing would be solved the phone would be the best
 Running 5.0 lollipop smoothly in it without any issues
 Memory bug which was present has been taken care of
 Pp can be moved to os cards
 Supports OTG.
 Overall Experience with the phone is amazing
 To be honest every phone does have some pro as well as flaws but compared to other honest this is one o the best i feel
 P.S- Wont hurry to update to lollipop as still its developing and has a quite few bursa
 Use mitka 4.4 till a good stable version is released

 His was my second moto go
 But it doesn perform like the one I got before
 The phone hangs even while making a call or opening gaily
 I requested for a return but the flipkart perform some online performance test via smartchk pp on my moto go
 And told me that everything is fine
 Now again I am facing the same issues and when I requested for return again FLIPKART REJECTED os RETURN REQUEST by saying that everything is ok and u should go to customer care center
 its not more that 10 days idea still 30 days replacement guarantee is there under FLIPKART ADVANTAGE things
 Why to go to service centre within 30 days when flipkart is shouting out lout about their advantage
 I hope they will replace it soon

 Guys... this review is not based on frustration
 From a third man point of view
 I am a moto g 2 user and giving a genuine feedback
 To not invest 12999 for three months... this wont last more than that... you can check with anyone after dating to lollypop the mother board is not capable of surviving due to the old in capable chipsets... and the service centers are pathetic in response... within 20 mind i was there in service center almost i could see 80 to 90 moto g 2 users waiting in queue for giving their phone for service... Google treats our nation like third rate users by dumping their products... pus go for windows which i did and next month it would be upgrade from 8.1 to windows 10. the best OS is windows...

 I have been using this phone from almost launch date
 I was extremely happy with this phone till I identified some serious shortcomings around a week back
 I went to a trip and did not carried a camera as I was satisfied with picture quality of this camera
 Before this trip I have used camera occasionally that too for not more than couple of pictures at a time
 In my trip as I was using phone camera just after 3-5 minutes of continuous usage especially in bright sunlight it stopped responding and my phone went to hung state even power button was not responding
 I left it as is for couple of minutes after which it camera did not worked but phone became sluggish
 During this time phone battery started draining at a faster rate
 I was able to use it again after about 5-10 minutes but faced same problem after couple of minutes
 After coming home I did a factory rest and hoped that this problem will be solved
 New days later I needed to record a live events
 Before starting recording phone battery was at 60%.
 After about 15-20 minutes of recording again the sluggishness and unresponsiveness appeared soon after which complete battery drained
 Other than above no major issues

 Its been six months since him using the Moto G and Men and him extremely satisfied with the phone
 The Positives: 1. Excellent form structure makes it easy to hold and operate
 2. Build quality is pretty impressive and even after six months the device feels like new 3. Absolutely To Heating Issue even after extensive usage like playing games watching video etc 4. Battery Life With Normal usage the battery easily last a complete day 5. Lollipop update has simply transformed the user experience
 6. Speaker Quality along with call quality is very good
 The Neutrals 1. Camera quality is pretty decent and captures good pick during daylight however there are not many functions to play around with the built camera pp 2. Screen brightness and Colour reproduction are satisfactory but definitely not the best
 The Negatives: 1. Evident Most Putting thankful with accessories only Pathetic Headphones along with pathetic charger To USB data cable provided
 Summary Overall him pretty happy with my Moto G and Men and even after six months thanks to the Lollipop update the device still can hold its own front of newer phone from Xiaomi, Lenovo, Micromax and all

 1. Excellent Cadet for people on the go 2. Old Black look 3. Easy to use and type 4. Great display and protection from Morning Gorilla Glass 3 BUT HORRIBLE DELIVERY SERVICES.
 my product reached vadodara hubs and was not delivered for 3 days as the delivery hut mentioned they could not deliver to my specified address
 I had to provide them a new address for which the vadodara hut returned my cells and had to place an order for a new cells
 These guns simply could not deliver the cell to the new address
 this whole ordeal delayed the delivery by another 5 days
 clearly unacceptable by Flipkart Logistics.

 I have purchased this product from Flipkart.
 I appreciate flipkart for very fast delivery
 I got this device with andros 4.4.4(Kitkat).
 It was working good till I did not updated it in new andros Lollipop(5.0.2).
 After update I started facing the issue of audit not coming from the call speaker during calls but my voice is going perfectly to other side
 When I report the phone it started working fine but the same thing was happening again and again
 To I request a return from flipkart.
 They asked me to do some trouble-shooting and rest the phone to factory setting (OS did not rest during this os
 But after trouble-shooting I kept facing the same issue and need to report the device again and again
 I requested a return again
 His time flipkart guns installed Smart-Check application to it to find the issue if it is real and I am not making it up
 That subdue application was unable find that issue as I have reported the device already and this issue of voice not coming was not happening every time
 FLIPKART AGAIN REFUSED THE RETURN.
 Os they replied that their application was unable to detect any issue although I keep telling them that this issue does not happened every time and your this application is not able to detect this issue at this point of time
 They replied The cannot sure about this kind of issue as we are not the manufacturers
 but we are sure about the thing that smart check did not show anything but we cannot assure that smart check are perfectly designed to detect the issue
 I again requested the return as I was facing the same problems
 His time somehow they were persuaded by fear or courtesy I cannot say they accepted my return and delivered a new Handset with ANDROID 5.0.2 well before the given time frame
 Now I am again facing the same issue and again need to request the return
 I have done all the troubleshooting which flipkart earlier stated me
 Even I have done the troubleshooting which Motorola told me but still facing the same issue and there is no fix for the problems
 I am still wondering what to do with this handset.
 I am not going to buy any motorola product in future
 Latest Updated I requested a return on with War 2015.
 I got a call the next day with War at 2:30 pm from a lady from isolation department stating that THEY WILL REPLACE THIS PRODUCT WITH A NEW ONE AND os THAT PRODUCT WILL HAVE PROBLEM THEY WILL REFUND IT.
 I CONFIRMED THE SAME FROM HER THRICE But here is the height of the cheating from flipkart, They call me up the same day at 5:23 pm telling me that they cannot replace it
 the max they can do that is to arrange a technician.
 I tried to explain the entire issue to that guy but that guy was not even ready to understand and told me the earlier information that given to you about replacement is WRONG INFORMATION DELIBERATELY PROVIDED os YOU AND THEY CHANGED THEIR POLICY FOR THIS PHONE os REPLACE os ONCE WITH A FAULTY PRODUCT.
 NOW YOU ARE YOU OWN AND FLIPKART DON'T BEAR ANY RESPONSIBILITY.
 I requested that guy to let me talk with any other more senior guy and he replied he is the most senior person in flipkart and no other senior are there
 They forceful arranged a Motorola technical and refused to believe me that phone is faulty
 In with March The technical visited and declared that problem is unsolvable.
 and this is a true fail case and recommended replacement but FLIPKART DON'T BLINK YET.
 Now I really canst say what at my money which I paid flipkart and what at their commitment for customer satisfaction and 30 days haste free replacement and That to do with this phone
 I am even not able to perform basic function that is calling
 Finally on with March Defended me my money
 Thank you Flipkart for your services

 I purchased this phone on January 26, 2014.
 It got delivered on time - within 3 days after I had purchased it
 The touch was satisfactory and overall it was all fine until ten days back - I realized that I couldn switch on the phone after trying several times
 That was the beginning of my misery with this phone
 I called up the flipkart helping to know about motorola service centers
 I was wrongly guided with an address that doesn exist
 A day after I managed to find the correct address
 I approached the center - 25 km away from my place of residence
 That lay in store for me was a terrifying reality - I had to pay 80 percent of the total cost to get my battery jack fixed
 Motorola is an ethical manufacturer apparently
 its flipkart's responsibility too to settle consumer grievances - this is a case of counterfeiting on part of both the manufacturer and retailer

KAMLESH MISTRY
 I got the phone but no satisfied as i think
 In Indian if Indian language will not support than its useless for Indian people and Motorola Support team also confirm that it will not support on this phone and Flipkart canst refund or replace it
 They also not describe this thing in their Product Pale / Technical Page... Too Bad...

 In 72 hours of delivery the him 2 port has stopped working and the authorized service center is asking for more than 10% of the cost of phone for such a minor repair.On not getting proper response within a month I will put the mobile on railway track,let it crushed make a movie of that and will up load on U tube.Flipkart should not sell products of such irresponsible companies
 Dear friends beware of such worst products

 I thought that morning gorilla glass is scratch resistant but i was wrong because there is a sign of scratch within three month of use
 By friend use etc one my with morning gorilla glass 2 for one year now and there is not even a single scratch
 I think Moto g and generation morning gorilla glass is same as ordinary glass
 2. battery drain too fast it does not last even for a half day when in use and it take too much time to charge

 After using for couple of months i am not happy with the mobile
 Initially i have problem with the speakers but not sure it got fixed after couple of months
 The phone is very slow
 when you launch 3 or 4 apes the phone is gone it will become unresponsive.
 when using apes like type for more than half an hours the phone heat up
 To red eye correction with the camera
 when the phone is idle that your wife also sleeps and you wont receive any messages
 once u try to wake up the phone all the messages will try to rush at that time and phone hangs
 To positive customer support from motorola.
 That they will tell when contracted is clear all data os Flipkart service 5 stars

 Now coming to the product it was initially a great product with good battery back as in my profession has to be present in the Nail 24hrs.

 I am not sure flipkart selling fault pieces or MOTO designed this way I am totally disappointed with this products
 lot of heat generation while attempting phone calls more than 5mins.
 battery back is bad the product is os for using 20-25 apply
 with Os the battery charge is worst
 I wont recommend this product to pp who are more dependent of Os and who attempt lengthy calls frequently

 I am very sorry to say that as moto g (1st) the new moto go is not at all a good phone now
 I bought the phone from flipkart 24 January and m using it
 I got a bad experience for this phone
 To without going to the merits i will directly come to the demerits:- 1. Shone charge about 3 to 4(maximum) with data ON... 2.Its getting hot but not much
 3.Simple games like temple run Ze subways suffer are stuck most of the time
 To guns think twice before choosing this phone
 there are other bands also out there which u can opt with low price better than this one
 DON'T UPGRADE os os Lollipop 5.0.2 until they lunch newer versions
 He Happy Always Eye

 The Mobile is good one and very simple the speed is good and does not hang
 His mobile does not have Note Had and does not share the screen to TV, but those are very rarely used also
 You can instal the noted from play stores
 and ms office is by default this is good mobile and worth money

 I bought Motorola moto g and genet 3 months back but the piece i got has many problems such as touch insensitiveness battery getting discharged , speaker noise phone getting switched off in between the calls etc but the worst problem is after sales service.Motorola has horrible after sales service
 They tend to make you wait about more than a month and then also do not resolve your problem completely.As u can see in my case , i reported these issues to the Motorola service center(SAI COMMUNICATIONS , GHAZIABAD) and then i submitted my phone there with these problems that i mentioned before.They took my phone for more than a month and then only replaced the display and leave out the other problems
 In addition to this they damaged my phone physically and want to charge me for that as physical damage dont count in warranty
 To as a reviewed i will suggest you not to buy Motorola phone as they have horrible after sales service but if this does not matter to you then you can do whatever you want

 Restored my faith in Motorola!
 Although To multicolored LED only simple plain white LED,also To os blister that makes this phone feel like incomplete but compared to the price it is set this is a very great phone so as to with all the best features Rose #OTG support Sure Lollipop with multiusers!! It least a white LED.
 Sons To Or blaster!!! Not sensory like GALAXY Os or Os but acceptable considering cost
 To multicolored LED.
 Not much RAM minimum B is basic now

 The sole reason for buying this phone was Lollypop and brand Motorola.
 To doubt phone is sturdy and have a solid built but the lollypop update has made this phone too lagged
 RAM usage goes too high frequently leading too crashing of applications
 I own a micromax andros one can Os and I can say it perform much better and faster that this
 May be due to Mitka but it is much better than this
 Motorola's claim of 1 day battery is also not true
 By the end of evening you have to reach the the switch board to get it charge
 Also the retailer os retail is not good
 They have sent me a substandard products
 It has got some visible damage marks on the screen
 By only recommendations is not to go for this product better buy another one
 May be much cheaper than this

 I bought Moto Os in Act 2014.
 Flipkart delivered in time
 The phone was good enough for its prices
 Towards end of January I started getting popes for andros OS upgrade to lollipop.
 I ignored for a while but bit the bullet on Web 12th.
 Upgrade was easy
 HOWEVER, the battery wouldn charge after the upgrade
 I tried couple of steps the Motorola Give Enter advised but those didn work
 When I was advised to take it to the nearest service center
 The service diagnosed the device and told me that the mother board of the phone was fried
 The phone is under warranty but they didn have parts in stock
 Apparently they have to "indent" for the part from the company
 Last forward to March 17th, after repeated calls and an email to both Motorola help line and also the service center I have yet to hear if the phone is repaired
 Apparently Motorola doesn have any parts in stock in Indian and they have to arrive from China
 Terrible

 thought all speck are good enough on the paper the screen is too dull it dont give out colors well and it takes a long time for charging
 the interface and performance is smooth for now but have to see if this will continue after using for some time since in all the andros phone this is the major issue that is after using for some time the phone starts to lag badly even for basic operations

 Yes I bought one for my mother after her Samsung Galaxy quos started dying
 His was a very refreshing change for her
 hers liking it every bit
 its much faster the screen size and resolution is good
 Easy to get used to and transferring all data using the Motorola Assist is an absolutely fantastic option
 The camera is reasonable and is a little cumbersome to use
 All in all a good phone for your mother

 The screen is good
 I have had the cell placed in very questionable corners of my Active for an hour ride multiple times in the first week , and no scratches or anything
 One the less I have put a scratch guards
 The gorilla glass felt better whatsoever
 Same (1GB) Suffices Most of the time its 50 % used
 That disheartens me is any time it reaches around 70-75% usage the cell slow down
 wont know if it is to be expected out of a Quadcore Processor
 I didn expect that to happen before 90%.
 You need to have Clean master to keep the cell smooth
 Os do use Clash of Plans and Brain Wars quite frequently but still no pp > 100 os ] Battery is really good so far
 Its been only a months use but 90% battery lasts me for more than a day
 Case involves frequent Clash of Plans and Brain Wars use once every 2 hours for 16 hours of the day I had a Micromax A116 which I bought 2 years back for ask and the only advantage I feel is the additional 16 os internal for k lesser value
 Os am very performance of Well tormented person and dont focus much on camera 1 os Am and quadcore snappdragon, have not been as good as I thought them to be before purchase
 The back cover seems a little fragile
 I am planning to get a rigid back cover over the existing one
 Though I would say it is a quite trustworthy Well in this price range and at these specie
