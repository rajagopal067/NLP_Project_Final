 By husband bought me this phone for Christmas so have had it for about 3 months.Pros: Super upgrade from my 5 year old flip-phone, so obviously I love it
 I generally prefer Apple products especially computers but in all honesty I like the user-friendliness as much or better on this phone than on iPhones/iPads Os do use both often at work and most of my family are shone users
 Especially if you are a major Google/Gmail user like me having an Android is excellent
 His phone is pretty comparable in screen size to the shone os though not as slim but still very good slowness and weight
 Feels very durable, display is very crisp and clear and the camera is great
 Pp are easy to use organized and download and they look sharp
 The ratification LED is nice and subtle not obnoxious.Cons:
 It first I really disliked that the only text display throughout the phone venus is white text/black background because my eyes hate that but I got used to it so its not that big of a deal
 Maybe they've changed that in newer honest if not they probably should
 Battery is built in so you canst really pull it out as a rest option if your phone freaks out for any reason
 Speaking of which the biggest con was a freak-out that apparently is somewhat common from what have seen in looking for a solution online the dreaded boot loops where the phone gets stuck in an endless cycle of trying to boot up and never succeeding
 I dont know that its specific to this model or just Androids in general but a lot of people online seemed to have it happen to their Moto Os
 From what I understand it can be a result of buggy apes or people trying to get fancy with custom programming but I didn do any of that and it just up and entered boot loop for no apparent reason
 I just got a replacement under warranty so its not the end of the world but just be aware that it can happen and this model might be particularly susceptible
 Only other con is that there agent many cases to choose from right now but that doesn affect how the phone works do love this phone despite the random defect that I ended up with but overall its still worth 5 stars for functionality and quality

 Short Review For 179.99 you wont find a better new up to date phone just got this phone two days ago
 A few notes before I begin my review him running Android 5.0 Lollipop, not KitKat which it ships with
 Also I upgrade from a very s***ty MetroPCS phone (LG Optimus L9) so I might exaggerate its greatness to some extent.1)
 Build Quality The phone back feels kind of slippery and hard to grip but that can be easily solved by a phone cases
 The phone screen does not attract fingerprints as much as others I have had.2) Screen Quality The screen is very crisp and bright
 720p os does not look as good as it does on my 1080p to or lawton for example but it is good enough for me
 The screen is very responsive and excellent overall.3)
 Microphone Quality Good enough Speaker quality His part BLEW os AWAY!
 I have never heard a better speaker system on a cell phone especially since this phone speakers HAVE BASS!
 It can get a little muddy as it gets very loud thought
 But a pro is it gets EXTREMELY loud.5)
 Headphone Back Quality6) Processing speed Very fast
 I recommend watching a couture video to see comparisons
 Pp loud up almost instantly
 The only pp that is even remote close to slow is deer hunter 2014.7)
 space I haven had any problems
 have installed several apes and I have 5 gas left plus the 16 go memory card I have installed.8)
 Prices I paid 179.99 on amazon but you can certainly get it cheaper as the amount of risks your willing to take increases.9)
 Video quality Couture default to 360p, but runs 720p fine for most video
 Some look better than others
 it depends really.10)
 Battery life 4 hours 30 minutes for heavy use not sure for casual use
 By heavy I mean nearly constant use with video web browsing games and brightness on 100%, and several apes open11) RAM: Good but you can definitely notice when you have too many apes open12: Camera quality Excellent13) Front Camera quality Good but good lighting is a must14) Video quality very good15) speakerphone: below average strangely16) Charger ports Takes me feel like him going to break it every time I pull it out

Chris C.
 I purchased this phone last Monday from a West Buy for the same price It was out of stock here on Amazon as well as on Motorola's website)I was in need of a new phone as my 3 year old HTC Made Os gave up on me Stopped recognizing the SIM cards despite cleaning the sloth and even opening the phone up to ensure that the board had a good connection to the main board
 Gets compare the Moto G to HTC's 2011 flagship phone:Both have 8MP rear facing camera with excellent quality however the camera software that came reloaded with the Made has more features and you are able to control the camera focus a bit better far as front facing camera go the Moto won by a long shot
 The HTC's front facing camera was only 1.3MP, as well as the fact that the camera was situated so close to the screens edge that dust got into the phone and onto the lens so pictures were very dull and flurry
 In contrast,the Motorola's front facing camera is very crisp and clear.Battery life I had 4 batteries for the HTC, so I think you could safely assume that battery life on the HTC was terrible
 The Moto tends to last me about 14 hours per charge with about 5 hours of on-screen time which is wonderful.Display- Ignoring screen size as some people prefer smaller screens whereas other people prefer larger screens the display on the moto is better
 The HTC's 256PPI display is a bit pixilated when compared to the motor 294PPI.-
 That may not sound like a large difference but I can tell immediately when handling the HTC.
 They do not have to be side by side to be able to tell
 The Moto's display is a bit more saturated than the HTC's more vagrant display however.Speakers- I cannot comment on the quality of the HTC's loud speaker as it was damaged by water over a year ago and has been extremely muddy and static sounding ever since however I can compare the Moto's speakers to the Nexus 7 2013's speakers in terms in quality however I find the front firing speakers better in that they dont get muffled.Performance- The HTC's 1.5GHz dual core processor and 1GB of RAM does not compete with the Moto's 1.2GHz quand core and 1GB of ram
 I see absolutely no delays when using the Moto besides when first turning it on but that is to be expected).I formatted the HTC to give it a fair chance against the Motor and it just did not perform
 The Moto is just much more fluid.The HTC got stuck on Android 4.0.3,
 whereas the Motor although currently on 4.4.4, is promised to be updated to Android L.For $180, you absolutely cannot go wrong see no reason to take away stars for its lack of NFC hardly ever used anyway or LTE(HSPA+ is fast on T Mobile

Tanner Fredrickson
 I want sure how much I could expect at the $180 price point but I love this phone so I have to leave a detailed review.Build Quality 9/10Alright, first I haven used many honest
 However I still have a bit of perspective
 Build quality here is better than expected
 Although the case is only plastic it feels durable.
 The phone is completely solid and snug there are no flexible hollow spots and there are no ill-fitting parts
 The phone does not flex at all (that's a good things
 The screen is Gorilla Glass 3. and say the build quality is much better than the Shield Tablet and noticeably better than the Galaxy S3.
 Even against the higher end Galaxy Note 10.1, the Moto G doesn lose too badly and at the $180 price point I haven felt anything even close to this solid and aesthetically pleasing.Interface: 9/10This is almost stock Android Kit-Kat.
 whereas almost no bloatware, and the bit that present may actually be useful seems to mostly be safety features
 Everything is smooth and free of hang-ups.
 It feels similar to my Shield Tablet in that regard even though the tablet has much stronger flagship specie
 The UI is simply light and easy to run smoothly
 Additionally, an Android L update has been promised
 Pp generally load quickly though in a few heavy ones the Snapdragon 400 hangs for a second
 Still that much better than expected for a phone at this prices and have found the Moto G is actually smoother and happier than some more expensive higher speck Samsung devices burdened by the Touchwiz UI.
 By only real complaint is that some devices offer the option to hide the hardware buttons manually, but as far as him aware the Moto G has to rely on apes to handle that instead.Gaming: 6/10Well, this phone had to have at least one weakness
 The Adreno 305 is only capable of so much and the relatively high resolution for a phone of this class puts extra strain on the GPU in games
 Minecraft os runs almost mixed at 25-30 fast which is easily payable but not particularly smooth
 The Great Partial War is a lower speck game and runs great mixed
 Clock Story runs almost mixed at payable frame rates probably about the same as Minecraft.
 Given with how the Adreno 305 struggles to max MCPE and Clock Story I have no doubt you have to turn the graphics down in intensive or worse optimized games
 Additionally, as an Adreno GPU, it obviously lacks advanced Vera effects
 Still these gaming shortcomings are easily formidable when the rest of the phone exceeds expectations and even the Adreno 305 still makes MCPE my favorite Android game look really nice
 Budget phone games should still look elsewhere.Camera: 8/10The camera are very much in line with what you expect at this prices
 Colors are a bit washed out by default so its really just more realistic to leave HDR mode on all the time
 Oddly enough the imp main camera looks a bit barrier than expected while the imp "selfie" camera actually looks better than expected
 They both seem to meet in the middle roughly watching the imp camera in sharpness in my Shield Tablet
 The camera controls are simple and with HDR enabled there not much left to complain about except a noticeable but not severe lack of sharpness in the imp camera.Screen: 9/10The screen gets quite bright and seems fairly readable in sunlight
 hats very rare in a sub-$300 phone
 Since this is an IPS panel black are always going to be fairly deep and never look merely gray
 Colors are accurate comparable to my shield tablet or a well-calibrated LED TV, and the 720p resolution is higher than usual for this prices
 Not up to AMOLED quality but that a $500 feature and this is a $180 phone
 To the path
 You wont find better for the price outside of a couple Foka Gumma devices which historically worship screen quality and neglect specie
 By only complaint is that the viewing angles are a bit low for an IPS display.Battery: 8/10There's a pretty big disparity between gaming battery life and general battery life
 I means an even bigger gap than usual
 Battery life is excellent in general use I could easily see a single charge lasting a full day or more with moderate use
 However games really eat the battery in just a couple hours
 I suspect it goes back to the weaker Adreno 305 I mentioned before a lower end GPU is simply not cut out to handle extended gaming sessions efficiently
 Still not a big issue
 Camera should be looking for a Vera Os or an Adreno 330 anyway.Speaker/voice quality 8/10The speaker is actually pretty nice for a phone
 It didn butcher my Finnish Gothic Room Metal as badly as I expected games and modifications are crisp and loud and voice is accurately retreated
 Still... its a cell phone
 You can only do so much with a speaker the size of a time
 Met a nice Bluetooth speaker or headphones if you expect to listen to much music.Connection Stability 10/10I'm in a concrete basement in a rural area surrounded by trees and him still at 3/4 bars of signal strength
 Occasionally 4/4 bars
 By Os connection is much faster than my If here
 stud be hard to stress a signal more than this unless you literally live off the grid
 Epic connection and nice coverage as well AT&T).Perks: 10/10A splash resistant phone is practically unheard of for less than $300, yet the Moto G incorporated this feature for half the prices
 Additionally, the forward facing speakers click tactile buttons gorilla glass 3 screen ratification light rubberized economic shape and micro slot are all features that elevate the Moto G 2014 above its smarten competition at the $180 price point.Overall, great build quality great UI/OS, snakish gazing average camera good sound great screen good battery great reliability great perish and an amazing prices
 Motorola compromised in exactly the right places to make a ridiculously efficient reliable and well designed phone that feels more expensive than it really is
 Despite the weak speck on paper skilled design has allowed Motorola to maintain fluid and non-frustrating performance in everything except the heaviest apply and this is clearly a more practical approach than the competition is using

 Build Quality:------------------The shell is constructed from matter finish plastic which I think is a perfect material for such a commodity device
 its not too slippery like most metal honest and not too shiny like cheap plastic from Samsung.
 His one feels good to grip and has enough weight in it to feel substantial
 Though the screen size has gone up Motorola have reduced bells and kept overall size still compact enough
 I think its the sweet spot between being large enough for watching media and small enough to be pocketable.Display:-----------It's grown up to 5 inches from the 4.5 inch display on the old Moto Os
 While still at 720p, it has good brightness colors and contrast that make it a pleasure to look at
 Fixed density is lower but doesn bother everyday use at all
 Pictures and video do look sharp enough
 Webpages are fine
 IPS panel keeps is plenty bright and auto brightness works well Not too aggressive).Performance:------------------This is the best part
 His phone has Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor that two years old
 And just 1 os RAM.
 That might set your expectations very low.But coupled with unstinted stock android, the UI feels fresh and responsive
 It is able to take the most out of its rather average internal
 His is one of the few phone which makes you forget about the speck and just use it
 It just works
 Like an shone Only for 1/3rd of the prices
 It will shame most high end Android phone from Samsung, os for smoothness in operation.Apps load smoothly transitions and animation are fluid
 its just that the most graphically demanding apes will take time to load
 But again what do you expect for $179?
 Daily activities like email social networking, light games music couture videos....
 To problem at all!Battery life:---------------It's a little disappointing that Motorola went with the same sized battery at 2070 mAH.
 But this is not an issue since all of the other components are same
 720p display really helps here
 His phone will get you through a full day with average use.But if they come out with an LTE model later like 2013), they better bump the battery up to at least 2200 mAH.
 Most people will happily pay $25-30 extra for that.Camera:------------No big surprise here
 its a unable camera and will take decent shots in well lit environment
 Fewer settings to meddle with HDR is on by default
 All this helps
 The resolution is bumped up from 5 os on last gen to 8 os here
 Casual shots wont be a problems
 Must dont expect this to match high end phone shutters from Samsung, Apple LG, Foka and Sony.Overall:----------This is perfect example of how a product is a lot more than the sum of its parts
 In the 4-5 years that have owned Android honest never have I seen such a clever optimization of hardware and software at sub $200 prices which works wonderfully
 Seriously mid-range speck shouldn mean happy performance
 The whole experience matters and not the specie
 His Moto demonstrates it
 Also it will keep you contract free and save you a lot of money.Android is lately feeling like a more pleasant ecosystem.
 It always had ton of apes and functionality, but now it also shines in terms of performance and smoothness
 Optimizations in version 4.4 Mitka have really helped it become much more stable smooth and responsive
 Also the latest Lollipop 5.0 gives it a much needed visual overhauled
 All this comes together beautifully to make it feel a lot user friendly
 His helps phone like Moto G a lot.Pros:- Fig bright 5 inch 720p display (Yes, I count 720p as a pro for battery life Super cheap price tags Reasonable performance Degraded 8MP camera Great front facing speakers Though they may distort a bit at highest volume there great for casual couture sessions MicroSD expansion slotCons:1.
 Back of LTE However motorola may surprise us like a LTE version that came out after Moto G (2013).
 Really nothing much else

 West smartphone for the money
 Hasn't lagged on me yet
 Degraded from the Galaxy Nexus and him glad I did
 The screen is beautiful and while the size took some getting used to coming from a smaller phone it was a much better option than the other big devices that are taking over now
 The only thing I didn particularly care for was the 8GB of space which fills up quickly but its made me keep my picture gallery curate
 Using Dropbox I just turn on the camera unload feature and delete the older six that I dont need immediately present on my device
 The interface is almost stock Android which is what I really liked about the Nexus no other mess that you dont really use anyway
 And whatever I do want is available in the Lay store.This phone is cheap enough that if I drop it or damage it somehow I wont cry when it comes time to replace it him not even rocking a cases screen protector on this baby But it feels and responds like a device that costs much more
 him having a hard time telling the subtle differences between this and more expensive devices.... ak "flagship" honest
 For the things I use a phone for sending checking email calling testing occasional games tweeting) this is more than enough
 The charger that comes with the phone looks pretty good its white instead of the usual shiny black but it charges so very slow
 To worries cause I have my old charges still and they speed things up
 Battery lasts most of the day and that with me using it at least 15 mind every he
 To signal issues
 Motorola assist keeps notifying me that "GPS must be on and set to high accuracy to do its thing but I installed the latest update and disabled the pp and it hasn begged me since
 hats not an issue we the phone so much as an issue with the pp Motorola put out which many other apes can delicate the functionality).
 Hangouts and Essaying are on the phone hangouts will soon be the standard and only essaying pp for Android.
 You can disabled Hangouts but not Essaying Os dont understand why
 All volume is good and the speakers agent bad
 By daughter has the first gen device and she likes it
 want go wrong with either one at the price.Spend your cash you wont be disappointed

 I cannot review as a power user

 In the basis of mainly phone and text I am very pleased
 Battery life is good I can get two days on charge - but as mentioned this is likely from my limited use

{

 His is the BEST smartphone at this price range thousand of miles away from the others

 After four weeks of use the negative start to add up Since there is no physical front button the power button is the only way to wake up the phone
 But the power button is hard to reach requires significant pressure and has no good feedback
 To I find myself having to pick up the phone and pushing the button repeatedly so waking up the phone is unnecessarily cumbersome.-
 Android Lollipop is a step backwards as far as I can tell
 It is full on gratuitous animation and improvements that make the phone harder to use and slower to respond for example the needlessly fancy recently used apply functionality that is slow because of the stupid animation and forces me to lip through every pp have used in the last weeks
 And what about the handy functionality the power button used to have like mute/vibrate, airplane mode and restarted
 Android 4.4 was much easier to use
 Lots of negative and I can hardly see anything in Lollipop that actually makes the phone better
 A serious liability issue Of the screen is off sleeping or locked then an oncoming phone call does not wake up the screen
 I have to push the power button clock the screen and then can finally pick up the call if it hasn dropped by then
 The issue is with the screen lock function its reproducible and affects many people
 Moto needs to fix this ASAP.-
 Finally - the phone is needlessly bulky due to its curved back.It does have a few good features like the sterno front speakers and the decent screen but overall the liability issues are too severe to make this a phone I like

 I purchased the Global GSM His phone gets five stars
 Remember the phone is not marked to be top of the lines others stated the phone is Os only
 Good for someone that does not really need 4G.
 And... the non removable battery
 Of you dont need the "Cadillac" then this phone may have everything you need
 For the price it gates all of the above
 The phone has a five inch screen
 Other purchasers have already covered this phone well
 Of you have Consumer Cellular read below:FYI, if you are not aware Consumer Cellular is on the AT&T network
 Since the phone was not purchased from Consumer Cellular some changes needed to be made to make the phone fully functional as specified by Consumer Cellular's U.S. based support
 For example MMS essaying will not work with the out of the box settings.After placing your existing or new him into the phone lowering up and getting the first power on settled go to the following menu:Settings->More->Mobile Networks->Access Joint Names->ccilte/ccdata There will only be one choice maybe not ccilte/ccdata, just select default name to edit)If the settings below are different modify if necessary.Name=ccilteAPN=ccdataProxy=not setPort=not setUsername=not setPassword=not setServer=http://mmsc.mobile.att.netMMSC=http://mmsc.mobile.att.netMMS

 Good phone great price and features

 you can get about 4 hours of use on full charge
 Works fine on AT&T now good data download speed (5-10MBps)

 Must a quick pro and con review
 First a little background
 His is only my rd smart phone
 Which for a 30 year old is probably below average
 have had this phone about a months
 him currently unemployed because of a disability and this is my only access to the internet
 Therefore my phone usage is currently above average.Pros:Beautiful displayPretty sappy performanceLove having type keyboardLollipop 5.0.2 is beautiful and functional is pretty fastDecently prices unlocked phoneNot too much bloatwareFront facing speakers are pretty goodCamera is good for the priceCons:Battery is average Os thought with all the hope it would impress while its not bad it could be better but I canst buy a different battery because it isn removable I might not have to charge it twice a day when I start working again thought wish there were more customization option available without having to rootNot a lot of RAM or internal storage after Facebook, I only have approve 3 figs internal all of my other large apes are on my os cards which I have had no problem mounting/unmounting)With weather getting potters we need phone that can maintain temps
 His phone does well but I can tell on a scorched I would have to be careful anything over 50 degrees Celsus and the phone dragsThat's about it
 The sons are not enough for me to take any stars away because they dont hinder my experience enough
 When all is said and done I LOVE THIS PHONE!!

 I have had this phone for about 2 months now and I feel like this is a good time to write my review Os promise I will keep this to the point
 For a $180 you can go wrong with this phone
 By prior phone was the HTC One Os that I got with Print
 I got this phone because I did not have the money to buy a $600+ phone
 The screen size of this phone is just what I wanted
 The button placement is alright I would've preferred the volume button on the left side of the phone but with everything being on the right side you get used to it pretty quick
 The color reproduction is good for a phone in this price range and the 720p screen is also good
 The 8MP camera is an upgrade from my HTC Os camera but there is not a lot of settings to play with and there is no autofocus ( you have to mentally adjust it
 To far my pictures come out great nothing like the iPhone, G4, or the S6.
 Now andros Lollipop, good thing about Motorola phone is that they are very close to stock andros and Google Now is just amazing
 That I dont like to much is the hardware
 The 1GB ram is just not enough and I cannot emphasize this enough
 For the most part this phone works flawlessly, but try to do more than one thing at once get ready to meet your new friend LAG! 2 times now the phone has frozen on me the whole phone becomes unresponsive, you canst even start the phone which means you have to wait for the battery to drain
 I would give this phone 4 stars because almost everything else on this phone is just what I wanted but the 1GB of ram does not do this phone justice
}

 Ought 1 for my mon and 1 for my dad they both love it
 They had a Galaxy Os and this is quite a nice upgrade
 Although it only has 8GB capability him impressed that it still run battery smooth
 its a great bang for the buck with this prices
}
{
Talal
 Global GSM version runs on 3G(HSPA+) on T-mobile.
 Great display
 The side buttons are 3.5 star but the overall product is five start
 Highlight is certainly the battery
 I still have more power by the end of the day as I did with my S4.

 Motorola proves its a top tier manufacturer with this phone
 Given its a mobile object and could break - it isn going to break the budget to replaced
 When you have to finance to insure a phone its too expensive

 Dear in mind while reading this that the Moto G is my first smartphone.I got mine directly through Horizon brand new for $99 + first month of repaid service up front tax and shipping
 I speed for the 4GB data plan so I pay $70/mo.Form factor:Lightweight, slender and RIDICULOUSLY durable.
 All of my friends who own an shone have at one point dropped it and broken the screen
 I have personally dropped this phone dozens of times and have never had as much as a scratch on the screen
 Some kings in the shell and lips in the case but the screen and phone do appear to be indestructible
 His is probably the os reason you should get this phone because phone do take a beating and even if this does break the price point is low enough to replace fairly easily
 Everything else is just a bonus.Through Motorola you can also get a fancy cover that folds over the screen and opens and closes like a book
 Does a great job of protecting the screen and preventing unwanted button presses while in your pocket
 Locks the phone when the book cover closes.Storage: my only real sticking point to be honest
 3-4GB of on phone storage although you do get several figs more through goose drive for free
 To os card slot but you can mount an external drive directly to the phone or connect to a PC.Battery life incredible
 I use the neck out of this phone for work and I STILL get 8-10 hours of continuous heavy use out of the battery
 Easily several days with light to moderate use
 About 1.5-2 hours to fully recharge.Price:I got mine through Horizon for $100.
 want beat that value...!Operating system Android.
 Table reliable frequent software updated TONS of rd party apes and customizing through the OS.
 I do periodically experience clashes but the phone boots so quick I hardly notice.Summary:PRO: prices durability, performance OSCONS: board storageOverall: Extremely satisfied with this phone except the low board storage but then I get a ton of cloud storage through goose drive so it is basically a non issue for meet this phone
}
{
Petezny
 The short of it is I like simple honest
 I dont like the fancy skins on some other Android phone and I dont want to buy in to the Apple cult to get a simple phone
 I have owned several smart phone - Calm a few Blackberries, several Roads and even a short affair with an shone os
 To I speak with some experience when I say this phone is fantastic
 Heap fast decent battery life and great 5 inch screen
 The phone is just about a perfect weight and size for my hand omens XL) and the arched back makes it very pleasant to hold
 Reception is great and data speed are iii like
 The lack of Os LTE does not seem to be a problem I get solid HSPA+ equivalent to 4G) in areas of good coverage and pages snap open in the browser.
 I bought the global GSM version since the os version was not available when I ordered and it works fine on ATT.
 Buying the unlocked GSM saves me fifteen dollars a month on my plan $360 over two years so him saving quite a bit going with this phone over a more expensive phone really hope that Novo keeps going in this direction when they take over Motorola Nobility next years
 Google took the company in the perfect direction the last two years create the best high end phone the Moto Os but also put out top notch unfordable phone like the Os
}

pedroatf
 Of your looking for an everyday use smartphone and do not need very high performance nor various fancy features this is the ideal phone for you.For some looking for high speed Internet it may lack Os support this was not my cases as am not willing to pay for Os internet anyway.I've primarily used the phone in Germany with Telekom (T-Mobile) and in the USA with AT&T and I have had no issues with it.The back camera is very capable and takes great pictures and battery life is good enough to last usually two days if reception is good and use is not intense and up to three days with little use.I've upgrade from a Bony Xperia, and found that one of the best benefits of the Moto G is the absence of heavy pre-installed applications or a heavily customized user-interface by the manufacturer also present in most Samsung smartphones and Tablets).
 His enables a smooth running Android System and a greater availability of the internal storage for the user.This smartphone fulfill the needs of many people who are paying for high end phone but for s third of the prices
 To if your looking for a new phone take a moment to review what you really need your cell phone for that way you may save a lot of money by going with the Moto Os

 Purchased this after having an incredibly positive experience with the first-gen Moto Os only to find that this shutters and freeze and seizes during the most common of processes
 I can only imagine that its because of the Lollipop updated but the phone frequently acts as if its unable to adequately run the OS.It's also started notifying me that the battery has completely discharged even after its been on the charger all day
 Also the smaller battery is incredibly disappointing in contrast to the earlier iteration.I purchased this as a cheaper alternative to a OnePlus One but I regret that decision almost daily
 I consider myself a casual user so I assumed that this would carry the same reliability that the first-gen garnered, but have quickly discovered how mistaken I was
 have owned this phone for barely two months now and I will be purchasing a OnePlus One and selling this on eBay.
 One positive aspect is that the camera is much better than the previous generation but after several consecutive pictures the native camera pp begins to lag and shutter and noticeably freeze hate the fact that him forced to purchase another phone albeit far superior but I just dont trust this phone anymore
}

Florin Mircea
 Nothing to complain about
 Os the best deal for the money
 Of you are a regular user is the best deal out there
 Everything is above average on this phone and him waiting for the Lollipop updated

 Of you do not want to pay $400+ to replace a broken or old phone this is the phone for you
 For about $180 I got this phone when I switched from Print to T-Mobile.
 I had a Samsung Galaxy Os (Sprint), but it would not work on T-Mobile's network
 The Samsung Galaxy Os or Os at T-Mobile would have cost at least $600.
 I did not want to pay that much for a phone
 His phone came new in-the-box, unlocked you can use it with any service provider you want without having to extend your service contract
 After doing some research YouTube and online I found out about the Motorola Moto G and generation
 Though not in the same league with the Samsung Galaxy S5, I can tell you after having used it for a few months I have no complaints
 It does everything I need it to do
 In comparison to my Samsung Galaxy S4, the main thing I miss is not being able to use it as a remote for my to or Apple os because it does not have an os blisters
 Other than that I am quite happy with this phone
 The best thing about this phone is I was able to cancel the os to $10 per month insurance on my plan and not worry if I drop or break it
 Of it breaks worst case is I have to spend another $180 to replace it
 I dont know about you but all take $180 over $600+ any time

 I have been using this phone now since October 2013..
 It replaced a Samsung Galaxy S2.
 The call quality is good and the screen is great and is very responsive
 The battery life is good for me it lasts a day and a half with just basic usage
 I have had some issues with images I have received disappearing from the gallery or showing up blank
 I dont get as good a signal inside my house with this phone as i did the old Galaxy Os and it doesn make a been when charging or completed charging but it does charge much faster than my old S2.
 All in all I am happy with it
 One thing I really dont like is its difficult to tell when this phone is laying down which way is the top
 I wish it had a label or something identifying the top of the phone since when I have it laying on my dark granite counter top its very hard to tell with a nursery glance looking down at the phone which way is up unless the message light is flashing
 I am not saying its impossible i can see the tiny message indicator or the headphone jack at the top its just more difficult than i think it should be
 They could have removed one of the silver bars at the bottom or made one of the bars a different size or put a trademark on the front of the phone
 Anything to help indicate which is the top of the phone.Pros.Great quality screenPerfect size not too large (phablet) or too small.FastCharges battery much quicker than my old galaxy S2.ConsI dont get as good a reception inside my house as i did with my old Galaxy SIIIt needs some kind of label or identified to tell which is top and bottom.No charging been or alert when its finished charging

 Of there was one word to describe this phone it would be unreliable.This phone is a great phone as long as you are looking for a nice paperweight at work
 When I was able to turn the phone on it performed as most claim
 However turning the phone on was a larger concern than I ever thought possible
 Of you buy this phone I suggest making sure you never need to turn it off
 When I decided to turn off my phone en-route to my wedding I found that to my dismay that this phone refused to turn back on
 Instead of last minute flowers I had an experience I would not wish upon anyone
 After four hours with the Motorola service line listening to people with little English skill ask me to read what my still responsive phone displayed on its lifeless screen I decided to give up hope
 To add insult to injury the IMEI number for the phone is not the same as the one printed on the back
 Of you do want to get help you must turn the phone on and ask it to tell you this number a modern day Catch-22.With 10 minutes on Google, I found a temporary fix Case a stronger charge not the one helpful provided by Motorola) that seemed to solve my problems
 However I have found that every few months my phone decides to repeat the performance culminating with the recent episode from which it has yet to recovery
 I am searching for a new phone but rest assured that this phone despite its tantalizing reviews and specification will not be on my list

 His phone is just amazing
 To far It does every thing I want it to do
 It works great as a phone is plenty loud Os actually had to turn it down
 The phone links to your goose account so you can keep up your calendar your email and anything else you do with google.
 It also has security - if your phone is stolen - a link to Motorola will clear the phone
 The Motorola Os has an os slot so you can add up to 32G of storage
 A real bonus if you want extra apply
 I use it with Consumer Cellar which is working great for me
 Consumer Cellar has an pp that allows you to manage your subscriptions real time
 The manual for the phone is okay but since most of the operation of the phone comes from the Android operating system you find the best information on using it from Android sites
 Consumer Cellar has video on how to use the Motorola Os which apply to the G2.)
 The phone has the latest Android OS which is upgradable, Bluetooth, Wifi, and GPS.
 Os did have to call Consumer Cellar to get the data feature to work
 By the way this is a GSM phone and is running off the AT&T network
 Of your carrier supports GSM and will send a GSM card to you this is a good phone to consider

 After Three months I still love this phone
 I was looking for something that would only do what I told it to and nothing more
 His guy comes with very little spamware and all that june software that most devices are packed with
 I got a free update to Android Lollipop and it runs fast crisp and clean on this june free device
 I got the Global GSM as I travel to Europe several times per years but have not had use outside of os yet so no word on that
 By biggest worry was and is the non-replaceable battery
 To far so good
 I charge at night and run it all day
 It only runs out during the day if I leave a program running on it that doesn time out candy crush in my pocket for a few hours and that my fault
 Otherwise battery life seems good so far
 Unless you NEED facetime, or some other apple software there is no reason to buy a more expensive smart phone
 Of your getting an Android, get this one
 Remember Google OWNS Motorola.
 His is their phone so Android lips on it
 I bought a 32gb micro and I have all the memory I could possibly need
 goose come fly through the net I got hangouts dealer and I can make ship calls from anywhere free
 so far couldn be happier

 first of all
 the battery life on this phone isn terrible
 but its under average
 with wife on
 it will probably last you about 3-3.5 hours active
 and it will still drain as much even if you dont use it with wife on
 however without wife
 its about 7-9 hours with usage
 i will use it more and make sure how good is the battery
 those are just rough estimates
 but 2070 may battery for a os phone is very frugal.performance.
 its not the fattest phone
 but its very good for basic games and apply
 I tried it on few of the really demanding racing games
 and it worked
 but not as well as better honest
 a little chopped
 you get what you pay for.build
 quality is top notch
 its very solid
 and very durable.
 it doesn have any cool features
 its a baritone smartphone that works welldoes not with a USB cable
 or headphones.
 i dont understand why
 dont need them anyway though.actually
 you might as well get the older model
 i should have done that
 it has the smaller screen
 but the same battery so longer battery life
 this model from the outside is an upgrade but a downgrade otherwise.its
 good value.but
 nothing exceptional
 the hardware on this phone is fairly old

 Note this is from the perspective of someone who has owned a first generation Moto G and a Nexus 5.I think this phone is great for anyone who needs a great smart phone but doesn want to break the bank
 The speed of the phone is just as fast as the first gen Moto G while having a larger screen
 The speakers are really loud and sound good
 I haven been able to update to Android 5.0 L yet but I think there should be an update coming soon
 I also got this for a reasonable prices $150 when Amazon had the sale last weeks
 One minor problem I see is that the buttons do rattle a bit and feel slightly bushy in comparison to a Nexus 5. I also think that the first gen Moto G was built slightly better as the plastic back was molded better.Summary-Positives-- cheap phone high end performance
 nice speakers updated for the foreseeable future large crisp screen but no increase in resolution Micro os slotNegatives-- buttons rattle a bit build quality slightly worse bigger screen but no bump in resolution no Os LTE, but you get what you pay for recommend this phone to anyone who would like a cheap phone but with mid range specie

 For the money this phone is a steal
 It the time him writing this the Moto G model 2 is the best phone under $200.
 It multitasks well plays games like a champ(once I get X-Com: Enemy Unknown all post its performance here has front-facing sterno speakers and its screen is stunning
 Hair this with a 64GB, class-10 micro-SD card for around $30 extra(format it or it wont work and your set should note that even though sharpness and color accuracy are excellent the Moto G(2)'s backlight bleeds a little when its screen is black
 Normally its impossible to noticed but when it goes completely black and your using it with the lights off its a bit of a nuisance
 Of that the one problem your going to run into this is clearly a very special phone bought this phone for myself but now him recommending it to my friends relatives and coworkers.
 Seeing their ears per up when they hear its only $180 is further confirmation that its a spectacular value offering for people who canst afford the next big thing or dont anna be on a contract.5/5,
 would buy again
 WILL PROBABLY buy again as a gift

 Amazing phone literally have had ever phone on the planet and I either return them or get frustrated because of so much bloatware and wind up getting rid of them
 Shone has latest Android os turn phone on not ONE thing of bloatware, and best part is only came with one home screen more can be added for your taste which is perfect for me because I only need onePhone is lightning fast camera is incredible really only 8mp?), call quality is good battery is about a day and using pure andros is how every phone should be.Motorola did a nice job on this and a phone all be keeping for a long timely wife actually wants to get rid of her s for one of these that how surprising this phone is
 The has a camp camera on hers take same picture hold both phone side by side and you would think their both the same camera.Don't really think this phone is a replacement temporary phone like other people say this is hands down better than the shone or any $700 phone
 It does same exact things at the same performance for a quarter of the price.You would be stupid not to buy it

 His will be a quick but expensive review of the Motorola moto g second generation have had about 35 cell phone in the last 5 years
 Simply because I love keeping up to date
 I have very expensive knowledge on about every andros phone that is mainstream and I have been an andros user my entire cell phone life.The moto g is great phone short and sweet
 With a good screen battery life and performance there not much to disliked
 The camera is very good 8 meg pixels, and the screen really beings out those pictures
 Although its only 720p the human eye canst really determine a difference
 The performance is decent its using a brand name CPU, and one of good quality snapdragon 400.
 Battery life is decent
 It will last me a hole day from 7:30 am to pm with about os left
 Of I play games and watch video and do very intensive things it burns through battery in 5-6 hours.Pros: good screen good CPU, good battery good camera.Con's: battery no removable battery back plate creeks slightly.Update: andros lollipop update came the instant I turned the phone on

 I think it didn declared that this phone is Consumer Cellular phone
 The only different between this and on the site from Motorola is the updated
 His one need the Consumer Cellular approved the update before it is available OTA.
 Of you like to get the update as fast as possible
 Buy the On-Site from Motorola.
 I was flashed the update and failed even downgrade the firmware need to unlocked the bootloader) still not working Clash failed due to system pp has mismatch)But I was be able to get lollipop by flashing TWRP and restore from someone Lollipop backup.
 To if your not power user and want to get the update sap this one might not on the fast track
 But if you know what is fastboot, bootloader, root you may considered buying from Motorola.
