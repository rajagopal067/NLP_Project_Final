 I purchased moto g 2 from flipkart, using it since weeks
 I observed that the andros operating system is using about 45% of the battery reducing the battery life to 5-6hr.
 While my wife is using moto e ( purchased from flipkart) its andros operating system is using only 16%of battery giving much more battery life.(she is charging once in three days both are running on andros 4.4.4
 versions
 I dont know why this is happening.If the manufacturers fill this gap in their next update,It would be the one of the best phone for their specification and cost
 Of there is any solution many users will be benefited

 I wont be bullshiting about configuration and specifications.. those are already on product display
 Device is working extremely good till now
 I am disappointed with into accessories.
 Charger charges phone really slow it doesn have farthing pin required just to support charger).
 Earphones are literally karp products utter plastic and it will make your ears red
 All can be excused because device is giving back more then what you have spent
 os is deduced because of into accessories.

 I dont need to describe the speck again as it is already given at Motorola's official page
 I have previously used a lot of Android phone like the Peri ZR, Peri Os but nobody came close to my tried and true Moto Defy+.
 I guess that is why I went for the Moto Os Build quality is good and grip with the Lip cover is excellent although I would have liked if the screen was 4.7 inch instead of 5 inch because it was too big for my hands
 The UI is fast and responsive with less to none bloatwares, although free RAM was a bit of a concern because only 300MB was unable
 It would have been good if they had included 1.5GB of RAM at least
 Also no 1080p recording
 That was also a serious summer considering the Adreno 305 can play 1080p.
 By Defy plus was his a beast because it never gave up even when I tortured it again and again with heavy drops water splashed and the Gorilla Glass was tough as hell because I never used a screen protector on it
 gets hope these things remain

 i ordered the phone on with Sov and flipkart given me the delivery date of with nov but they delivered the phone on and Sov .
 the phone is excellent in all function say its call quality no lag in gaming with quand core processor best camera in range of 13,000 os loud dual speakers best user interface pretty and latest andros experience like weight better screen etc in case of battery life all the andros phone get heated in multitasking and less battery life but this phone is best i had used canvas nitric axiom red os and canvas eliza all three can be used for droning when they get heated also the ui of red os is worst no task button found on it whereas canvas eliza and into was good but they doesn have gorilla glass protection
 you can also experience the latest andros in market with this phone
 so if you want a good phone within this price range then go for moto egg of go because it not only gives value for money but can be used for 2 to 3 years if used like a human being not animal
 and thank you flipkart for your best service

 I am really happy with MOTO G and genu
 Its totally pain was mobile
 and great speck and build quality in this price range
 Some things that i think can be improved are os Battery life I can still manage 1 whole day on less than average usage
 os Camera option or more feature in camera software though image quality much improved thanks to 8MP paper os Bags sometime that because its running the same snapdragon 400 1.2 The quand core Need some more Figs os Overall very well built phone speakers not at the par with HTC but pretty loud
 Definitely winner in under 15K price range

 Moto go is an awesome pon e within its price range...display is very crisp and clear
 sound of speakers is good not very much loud but has clarity supports nod videos.. it it would be one step satisfactory if full he being supported by this device it its ok Camera 8MP is very nice and the front cam also i will give 9 upon 10. device is very fast the processor and ram is given such better performance is very good os one thing it has that the head phone is not to good .
 output is low
 and has a non removable battery
 But overall the phone is outstanding...!! Am loving it os

 i got my moto g 7 days ago ... i think i am eligible for writing a review after hardware usage for nearly a weak os 1. pretty quick processing os 2. camera quality is really impressive including front camera 3. display quality is fairly good .
 4. front dual speakers serve the job , pretty descent sound quality 5. OTG USB Support 6. 16 go internal memory + micro card slot 7. good gaming experience ( played heavy games like blood and glory , dear trigger 2 , shalt 8 without any problems cost 1. i dont care much about RAM .
 though i find 1 go is enough for me ...multitasking can be tricky on this phone os 2. fair battery back but have to charge every day ( 6 hours of display time with average use including 1 hour of gaming , 2 to 3 hours of net usage , half hour to one hour calltime etc 3. if put on a cover , phone tends to get warm after heavy gaming or camera usage ) but not too hot , warm .
 i have tried to give u a unbiased opinion , simply best in this price range .
 only xiaomi mid is a better phone than this in this price range os so if u are hesitating to buy this phone please
 dont os u will be satisfied at the end of the day os

 His review is for all the prospective buyer of flipkart who is intended to buy any product from so called meg commerce retailer
 I want to warn each and every one of you to abstained oneself from get created and feel betrayed
 I want to share my horrible experience that I had recently WITH FLIPKART.
 New days back I booked a moto G and gen and paid extra for GUARANTEE one day delivery
 I did not receive the product on the schedule date and when contracted with customer care they said it cannot be delivered on that day but it will take 2 more days
 I was also promised for compensation by way of cash in my flipkart wallet within 48 hours
 But this could not happen even after a weeks
 Moreover to my surprise they said I have asked them to schedule delivery and that is why this was not delivered to me that day
 I cannot understand how mischievous one can be
 Now fraudulent one of the reputed online store can be
 Now professional one could be
 Last
 Even after this much of persuasion they dont consider it as their responsibility to respond to its customers
 Conclusion:- good product but worst service
 I am giving rating one because I was not allowed to give zero rating

Ajay Narang
 Overall its a good phone by Motorola, but it does have some sons like 1. Speakers speakers sound quality is very bad 2. All quality The nikita feature phone has much better call quality as compared with this phone
 3. Charging time When I received this phone it had os battery It took 4.5 hours to charge only 80% battery
 And now it is taking 3 to 3.5 hours to charge 100% Otherwise this phone works great as it has stock andros so there is no last
 And battery life is also good for medium usage it can survive the whole day
 And now I m expecting Android Lollipop..! Os overall Its a good phone at this price tag!!!

 I am facing issue with the apiece sound quality there is a continuous hissing sound while in a call
 The display registers stroll gesture as touch which is very annoying while browsing web
 Also the buttons are not good and the power button feels like it may break
 His is in contrast to another set that I ordered for my friend
 Another interesting point is that the default plastic sheet on the screen had no logs on my set while it had some Motorola inscription on the one my friend received
 Looks like it was a refurbished product sent to me
 It is appalling to see such bad quality control on Motorola's part and Flipkart / os Detail on not pursuing better standards
 Have called Flipkart Customer Are and they have promised call back in 48 hours lets see
 Update : Received replacement today
 His one has issue with antenna and is not able to connect to network
 Cried different SIM cards as well
 I am more and more convinced that they are pushing products without quality checks or are selling refurbished products to meet the demands
 His is really disappointing
 To far Flipkart's service has been good though not sure if they are taking due care in making sure that the faulty product or batch of products is identified and notified to Motorola, or they are simply circulating the returned products

 His product is very bad
 I will suggest you all not to buy this product from this site
 They are delivering damaged product because of their small mistaken your product will be fully damaged
 I bought this product in last 15 days they delivered me this product with small crack on display
 Today my product was just slightly get hit by wall so from that damaged side it got fully cracked
 I called to their customer care but they are saying that it will not returnable.

 When compared to other andros phone in market,it's performance is awesome.
 Camera is too good
 Must gets affected a bit during night photography,just a bit
 To doubt about screen
 Moreover for the game kind people this is a right choice at this budget
 Doesn't lag a bit while playing games and special thanks to its 16 go internal memory
 I play Shalt 8 Airborne(1.56 gb), Batman Graham Origins(1.1 GB),Injustice: Rods amongst Us(2 GB) simanltaneously.
 Also other factors are good especially its sound
 Again thanks to its front dual speakers...!!!

 Well I was using Gumma 820 Windows Shone ) Since An 2013.
 I recently switched to Android through Moto G and generation
 To be honest my experience has not been bad but it is not great either
 Andorid has apes that are missing in windows phone
 In terms of Hardware or the OS performance I still feel that Foka & Windows OS are the West
 Talking about MOTO G and Men os Camera : 8 os camera does a decent job
 It is course not the best
 But good for the price you pay os Processor Well to be honest the 1.5 The Snapdragon processor in Gumma 820 is far better than the Quadcore processor on this device
 os RAM : you get just about 831 os /1024 MB. os Shone does experience some lag occasionally
 os You get a lot of accessories to choose for this phone
 For prospective buyers I would suggest you go for this phone if performance c is not that Important
 By suggestion : To for a good Windows Phone(1GB is more than enough or a good Android device with atleasst 2GB RAM

 I bought new Moto G and Men 2-3 weeks ago
 Unfortunately I got the defeated piece
 It was hanging very badly
 I contracted initially support team of Moto Os but they were not able to fix the issue and suggest me to replace the products
 After that I raised a Replacement Request
 They've replaced it but given me used product which was in extremely bad condition there were so many scratches on the screen screen guards , phone looks so old and the back side was smelling like something burn inside may be chips due to heating issue
 have contracted them regarding this issue they said to replace it again
 I hope they'll not provide the used one
 @Flipkart : Us !!! him really disappointed wit you
 From now all not prefer buying product from FLIPKART.

 I am using this Shone from last 2 months..the cadet is simply great for Gaming ..Asphalt 8 Airbone experience is awesome very good graphics..some laws after heating..but that can be ignored Camera is not so good bad but not so good as well...does focus properly sometimes..but its flash light is very effective and bright..good photographs in dark as well Processor is simply great..very smooth for operating... but i personally facing the issue with its speaker..it's a loud enough but the voice clarity is so poor...even it gets heated for longer time calls sometimes you can not even hold phone near to your ears for longer calls you may need to use your headphones which are not so good..disappointment from motorola ... But the best part is goose updated they are so fast on this gadget..
 Os a Google supported stock andros OS (4.4.4..will soon get the Lollipop update too..) their are some drawback like calls recording and os recording is not available..no start button available...and the UI is sooooo very boring...but you can use launched available in market...motorola should have done some modifications in OS...
 But overall a very good phone from Motorola....
 And most important part about Flipkart..a very good service guns purchased two Moto G and generation so far..once replaced but now everything is fine...
 Of you are looking for good brand and budget phone go for it...

 I bought this product on with of Act and delivered on with Act I am not satisfied with the delivery
 Previously I had a very good impression of flipkart.
 After buying this Shone I am frustrated with Flipkart.
 About phone MOTO G and Gen..
 I got a defeated product from Flipkart.
 Memory card not detecting, Getting Seated Hanging Problem Too much Battery back is not at all good
 I have given 10 complaints but customer care executive are raising requests technical team is saying we can not replace on your address
 While new purchase you are able to deliver now when need replacement you simply denied replacement and no reverse pickup?
 for refund also I have to dispatch the phone
 I have given this phone as a day gift to my fiancee
 Now I have to ask her to courier this phone to flipkart.
 this is really a insult for me
 I cannot trust flipkart now

 I friends i ordered moto go on must , got it on with .
 delighted to see such a good phone
 tested it SPEAKERS , they were defective got it replaced in a weeks
 and phone tested again SPEAKERS were defective approved by Motorola service center.'complained to both Motorola & Flipkart.
 Not an another replacement..... this time got an repaired phone with screwdriver scratches .
 It last refused the amount
 i think flipkart services are good as they gave me 2 replacement but motorola pathetic .
 NOW SOMETHING ABOUT PHONE... screen size is 4.7 as navigation option doesn goes off when u open any application
 speakers horrible experience but still not clear but loud... or try to change equalizer settings
 camera is good ram is enough but can play even games smoothly like deer hunter 50mb).
 overall a very good phone at this price point , no competitor as such of now
 BUT ONLY os U CAN A GET BRAND NEW PHONE FROM FLIPKART NOT A REPAIRED ONE.... 3 stars for phone and somewhat service from flipkart.

 I got defeated product(Sim1 slot issue of Moto G(Gen2) and I requested to replace the item within an our after receiving the mobile .Flipkart responded and agreed to replace this item next day They processes and made for pick and replacement for the same address on the very next day The funniest part is it came through part logistics .
 When I cracking it the status is changing that unsuccessful deliver attempt without even communicating me and also canceled this products
 Now can this happen without contracting the customer ???
 They change the shipment status without pick up and delivery attempt I wrote two email to flipkart expressing my concern over this issue and told that I paid for guaranteed one day delivery I need good service His is worst delivery service I faced Still the problem is not resolved Waiting for my product

 Moto g and gen is a good buy actually......Flipkart delivery was good....a couple of days before the promised date....so 4 stars for that
 (15-11-2014 order date (22-11-2014 expected delivery date (20-11-2014 actual delivery date was using sonya wt19i previously....so as far as user experience is concerned m having a fun time using it
 Its an awesome upgrade for me so far.......as far as the review i have been using it for not more than a day or so....so this is not a review actually just my initial impressions
 A good budget buy with premium looks and feel....and a great performer keeping in mind the price tags
 was confused with a couple of other models too.....asus zenfone 5 and huawei honor 6....but was impressed with moto g....and its worth a buy actually....atleast for me ;-) ....in all its a good product under 15k... To all confused minds out there its a really good phone and doesn feels a budget one at all
 All individuals have different Priorities.....finally its unto you....in all its a great all-rounder.....and yes about the battery its koko 8-10 his with normal usage.....as its been a day or so using this mobile....will list out about battery back and few other things later.....

 I ordered the Shone on September 11, 2014 and got it delivered perfectly before time by September 14, 2014.
 Surprisingly this was my first ever purchase from Flipkart.
 I am writing a review about this Product after using it for more than two months now
 Talking about some of its key features a 1 os RAM: Works great but may lag a little while too multitasking if you have loaded your phone with too many apply
 by
 Dual Him (GSM + GSM): him using it for two Him Cards and is working brilliantly for me
 c 1.2 The Qualcomm Had More Processor Well yes
 It is pretty fast
 Had More Processor helps
 do inch os Screen The screen is brilliant
 Fig and sharp display
 e Expandable To 32GB: His is like a treaty
 You have Internal Memory of 16 os which you can utilize for all the apes that you want and still have ample free space to fit at least 2 seasons of FRIENDS in it to watch during your commuted
 And I am using a 32 os Memory Hard along with it which gives a brilliant memory space for everything that you need in your phone
 ff
 Android v4.4.4 (KitKat) OS: Well if you are thinking of buying this cells
 then do it
 Because the exclusive surprise that Moto may give you in the coming months wont be even funny
 Lollipop Update coming soon before anyone else except Nexus 5. go 8 os Primary Camera and 2 os Secondary Camera To issues and no complaints at all
 Clean clear and sharp images
 Battery Yes if your cell shuts down due to low battery it will take some time to boot again
 Because it needs to get charged to a minimum voltage before it can start
 That can be pretty irritating during urgency
 The cell takes a bit of time to get fully charged but its all good
 Trust me no other phone in the 15K category beats this phone & the only phone in the market which you will feel inferior to are Moto X must Gen), Moto X and Men and Nexus 5 and now the obviously coming Nexus 6.
 But before you move on a look at the prices of these honest Moto X must Gen): 18,000 Expensive by 5K) Moto X and Gen): 31,000 around 18,000 may be Nexus os 24,500 (11,500) Nexus os 44,000 not in the same league To yeah go ahead and buy it
 You wont be disappointed
 It will be a great time with it

 Was very happy when I got this phone in starting but as the days went by it started showing its true color that the worst shopping experience have faced so far
 Now I noticed a lot of bags in this phone doesn have even average speaker make a cracked voice while playing the music or a call at high volume
 Having problems with Os network it keeps losing signals by every 2 mind while its working fine with other Moto g honest
 Battery drains too fast even after following the steps provided by flipkart techs.
 Now I am very much disappointed with Flipkart's customer service I request for replacement twice but they rejected it saying that all things is okay and this phone is natural in this way Now I need to file a case in consumer court very soon if you guns wont take any proper action

Jadeja Chandra...
 The phone is very good in terms of features and design
 Battery lasts enough on wife and 3G.
 Didn't found much battery drain difference in Os and Os usage
 Good Camera quality
 Only one thing moto can upgrade is 2 os RAM because so many manufacturers are giving 2 os Am and i think it will helpful in future software updated
 With current software and minimum number of useful apes i found only 250MB free out of 1GB(890MB) that not good

 I have bought this phone on with Sov 2014.
 Very strange it does not allow us to delete the saved contact it says it is read only file and we can hide the contact on with Sov suddenly I found my half of contact are missing call log sheet is empty and majority all whatapp nos too are missing then it is not allowing us to call from the contact list it shows only whatsapp icon and we canst call anybody unless we physically punched the nos.Finally Flipkart is taking back this faulty piece and replacing with new one whereas I wanted cash so that I can buy any other phone than this but their policy is to replace it and they canst refund the cash
 There is no good after sales support
 I had a very bad experience with this phone

Srinivasan Raja
 The product is very good at this price range
 Os usual the service from flipkart is awesome.
 Nothing negative except little heat when we take video,photos continuously
 But Hittel Os offer is bonus as they gave the service for 1 month and disconnected instead of 2 months
 Called up customer care and poor response
 not holding their promises
 I dont know whether flipkart will take action against them or not

 Excellent phone
 Being a bit conservative I was looking for either a Samsung or a Nokia.
 But the quality and specification of this Moto G are much better than the speck of Samsung of Foka phone available in this price brackets
 Camera quality is especially awesome.

 You all must be aware of hardware / software speck and fastness smoothness
 1.
 Os for me dual him matters
 Simply best auto twitching between 3g/2g.
 Not need for manual twitching like other phone like I do for micromax.
 2. Was 16GB under hood
 But 32GB more to add ext memory
 Blessings
 3. os inch os screen good enough with gorilla 3. That more you want
 4. Processor RAM and battery decent enough to perform best with current KitKat 4.4.4
 soon Android 5.0 5. Build in battery enough for a day
 6. Good Camera Clarity day as well as night
 time points 1.
 To data cable in box
 An use any old one
 2. Earphone old style drum type
 To near post
 3. Txt memory should be least 64GB.
 4. Battery only 2070 mAH.

 First of all blazing fast delivery by Flipkart.
 Ordered on Sunday and delivered by tuesday
 The phone works amazingly well and for the price has very decent specification
 The 1 os Am and Snapdragon processor pack a punch and with Multiple apes in operation twitching between them is very smooth
 The display is also very good and Sunlight flexibility is also quite decent
 The stock Android 4.4 does away with all the useless stuff and Transferring my DATA from my previous Android using the Moto Migrate Pp was a breeze
 Camera is also quite good and Pictures taken are quite clear and vivid
 All quality is also nice and the Battery lasted more than a day with Dual SIM usage and Os network use with moderate use
 Only On I found till now was the metallic bars at the top nd bottom of the phone
 They are a had uncomfortable when u happen to take a call in a busy street and stick or phone into or ears
 But on the whole that a very minor discomfort and Motorola has lived up to its name
 wont think too much if u r on a budget
 To and order

 I bought this product a month ago
 Will then I using and I like the product too much
 Its performance is very impressive
 Though its overall performance is good but it has some cost
 Rose os The design is awesome that fits your hand easily
 os Screen is bright os Camera quality is good but not as much good to compare with samson 5MP camera quality
 os Round quality is awesome os Performance is awesome, all application run smoothly even os movie runs without stopping
 Maximum game runs smoothly
 os All quality is good with noise cancellation
 os Touch quality is nice
 Sons os Battery back is not so as I aspect but all andros phone eats more battery , so compared to other battery back is normal
 os Time require for charging is more
 os Less option for camera and music modest
 os His product comes with no external us cable , you have to buy separately
 But with all the Gros and sons the product is awesome.I think Motorolla and Google makes the product so amazing
 Thanks for the Motorolla+Google product and also thanks flipkart for the service
 Thanks for reading........

 Moto G Second Men was my first budget Android phone
 For past 4-5 years I have been primarily using flagship phone only from Samsung or HTC most of the time
 I am really fed up with their never changing and ever heavier getting custom UI solutions which get in the way of updated as well
 But when I tested one of my colleagues Moto Os Now
 A budget phone with this good feel in hand and extremely fast performance it was almost unbelievable.
 His phone proves that the specification hope is not worthy of all the price we pay for these Act More honest
 Sure you get Act More processor and 2 os RAM, but most of it is used for supporting manufacturers own bloatware and custom UIs.
 Not the case with Moto Os
 The speck on paper are mid range at best but due to the optimized KITKAT OS, the performance is on par with any high end phone
 1080p Video playback is lawless and most of the high end Os games run just fine
 The battery is also something that made me skeptically at first but again the number game is at play here as well
 The 2000 odd may battery seems small when compared to any other high end phone but the battery back for me with moderate to heavy usage is 5 hours of screen on time and full 24 hours of total auntie on a single charge
 In heavy usage it reduces to about 18 hours total and 3.8-4 hours of screen on time
 His is on Os only with If only in the evening and morning times before and after officer about 1 hour of calling 1.5-2 hours of music half an hour of video whatsapp and facebook at regular breaks etc
 The only On I can think of is the flies back cover opening it is hard at least on a new phone and it bends as well
 Flush the power on off button is a little too much used and might get wear and tear in long run
 Overall its a great phone for a great prices for those who are looking for a Nexus like experience
 I would say go for it
 os Os usual Flipkart's service was great delivery was on time as promised
 One suggestion I would like to give is to enhance the cracking system a little to show updated in a more detailed and frequent manner
 After purchasing a products the eagerness to get the product in our hands sometimes crosses boundaries Os

 Moto g and generation is reasonable price for the specification and everything good
 But if any repair happened means the cost of service will be half price of this mobile
 Moto g service center ask more prices
 By moto g and inside display got damaged
 i gone to service center in pondicherry
 they asking 7000 os for preparing i did not repaired the mobile
 i kept the mobile in my home itself and brought new nikita windows phone within 6000 os
 Moto g service is very bad
 they showing partiality based on country in USA for first time damage they replace the new mobile freely but in india they did not give so think before u buy

 I really love this phone
 It looks pretty beautiful
 Features are very good speed is good
 But you should go for lip cover to protect this phone though lip cover is expensive
 But it is mandatory
 After I bought this phone my participation in social network interaction with frees and family accelerated
 West andros phone , budget phone almost same features as Samsung galaxy grand 2 which comes at 18k.......which k more than this beauty
 I am using all social network playing games installed many apps...working fine but after all this it became slightly slow but really we canst notice much
 Only disadvantage with this phone dual him + internet usage your battery will die very fast ......hardly 4hrs.
 Also battery chagrin is slow........I donne about other phone battery backup.
 To I am using single him with internet ....batter back improved
 Data also I tried to optimism the usage for better battery backup.
 Good phone from Motorola after long time to give break to SAMSUNG monopoly

 I have ordered Moto G on and Love 2014 and received it on with Sov 2014.
 To clearly thumbs down to the delivery
 I could have got it at least 3-4 days earlier
 Os far as the phone is concerned I am satisfied with its performance
 I have made a list of pro and sons after the initial usage
 Gros 1. Brilliant Display Really liked the display
 It is easily readable in bright sunlight
 2. Early updated Furiously waiting for lollipop updated
 3. Build Quality The phone is very sturdy and feels premium to hold
 Round Round quality of speakers is very good if not excellent
 4. Camera I have used Moto G(2013) and I can say that the camera has improved
 The images turned out sharp and the colour accuracy was also spot on
 Sons 1. Battery 2070 may battery is just not enough for a he display no matter how good battery save pp you've installed or no matter how efficiently the os manages it
 A little bit of gaming and os video decrease a considerable percentage of the battery charge
 To you need have a power bank all the time
 2. RAM: It has 1GB of RAM which is somewhat on a lower side
 You wont notice that in normal usage scenario but if you have installed lot of apply while playing games you'll notice drop in frame rate
 But that only when you play heavy game(meant for snapdragon 400 processor
 You wont notice a thing while playing casual games
 Earphones: I my opinion if your spending ask on a phone you should get something good
 Earphones provided are just mediocre.
 Very low on volume and no bass at all
 Charger: The wall charger provided is just 550mA which takes ages to charge the phone
 You can buy a Os charge
 Conclusion One can overlook all the sons for its vanilla os which results in sick performance
 But the only deal breakers is the battery which is a serious cause of concern for a person who is consistently on the go
}

 have used this phone for 3 weeks and now him writing the review Gros -1.2 The processor(Snapdragon 400).
 It is just a 1.2 one but can be compared to a average 1.6 the exynos/mediatek/broadcom processor.It's snapdragon folks

 I have bought moto go before 15 days
 It is good but i by facing problem regarding g network
 In moto go while choosing network mode its showing preferable mode g or g instead of g only like samson and other handset.
 But in dish as well as other state there is a lot of problem with g signal
 Hence I can not receive high speed net as in my last samson mobile become moto go can receive g signal as the g signal strength is more than go
 Of there was "3G ONLY" setting available in moto go Than i can receive the g signal instead of go where there is low g signal

 Received Moto g and gen on with Sov with drained out charge
 Not plugged in but it was not charging for 10 min at all
 After 20 mind suddenly 2 % flashed out
 After full charged I then kept in the box again
 After few hours saw the charge went back to 73% from 100% without any reason
 And the screen was displaying some auto report text
 To from me a bad rating for moto g

 I bought this phone from flipkart and I must tell you it is a superb one
 Very thing in this phone is almost perfect
 Well designed well equipped
 Touch senor camera both rear and front os speakers every things
 Although if it would have been a full os screen and snapdragon 800(+) processor it would have been an unbearable one
 Still its best under 13k.

 Everything is very good except for the 1GB RAM which falls short once in a while causing reading of apes or brother pages from recent
 A true peoples phone for a wide majority of people especially considering references of the Indian market
 have bought 3 units on behalf of relatives/friends and all are very much satisfied with this phone apart from x moto g st gen and x moto end
 In a personal note since the OS is AOSP with minimal modifications a lot of tears are possible once rooted and then it becomes an awesome phone without competition with other sub ask honest

 > Not this through in-a-day delivery guarantee and I must say I ordered it at around 6:00 pm on with Sov and relieved it at around 1:00 pm on with Love Packing was great
 All in all have been happy with Flipkart as every
 Was been a week since I have started using Moto Os Works exactly as I had expected like the design of the phone and it is very easy to hold and operate
 Took & Feel > The 2 speaker strips in my humble opinion actually give a pretty good look to the phone...at times it did confuse me though about the the orientation of the phone as it looks same from both ends except for the front cam on top...lol but that nothing to worry about
 Back cover is very soft and smooth to touch and feels great in the hand
 Display > Screen colours are pretty amazing crisp and clear
 Battery > Battery is working very well and after a normal day usage is only coming down to around 45-50% by the evening when I reach home and charges back up pretty quickly
 Camera > I love the camera on this phone though takes a bit of to do for getting used to it after that it takes great pick even who compared to other 8MP came such as that of Nexus 5. Room clarity is pretty good
 > Lo Motion os video recording is the one I like the most in this for video
 > Also the Sacro pick taken from this cam have pretty amazing clarity from almost 1-2 inch distance
 Auto focus combined with setting your own region to focus works great
 Round & Music > Moto have outdone themselves with this one
 The software coming for sound output is extremely amazing and the Media effects included with the default player have more than 20 different setting for Wired/Headphone speakers or the mobile dual speakers separately
 > Sterno quality of the mobile speakers is great
 When I first got it and was listen to some sterno track I had to literary check that where is the sound coming from because the sterno is soon great that it felt like the music was playing from behind the mobile
 > Mobile's sound output to my 2.1 Surround system is just great and pretty pretty long so much so that 50-60% output is more than enough
 Processor and Operation/Graphics: To laws as of now and pretty optimized ram usage
 CPU management is also well balanced keeping required CPU core in sleep/standby mode so as to save battery
 Pretty decent graphics with no lag whatsoever even on graphics intensive games
 Transciever and WI-Fi: > Clear sound reception and transmission with a powerful tranciever, receiving signal strength even in places where my last mobile hardly caught any signal
 > Wi-Fi Hotspot is the nearest area of the phone
 The range of the wife hotspot is very less and as compared to my last phone it is not even half of it range
 The only drawback I have found in this phone is this
 Still it works pretty well

 I bought this phone because I was sick of using my Moto E also purchased on Flipkart).
 Not delivered in a day
 It looks exactly like the Moto E from the back except that it is larger
 The Moto E sports a smaller rifle for the front-top speaker while the trifles are of equal size on the Moto Os
 The placement of the volume rocket and power/lock button are exactly the same as on the Moto E - which actually doesn make for great design
 While using the phone in the dark it is easy to inadvertently push the power/lock button instead of the volume /-, which can be very frustrating.
 The battery life is only so-so.
 I keep my screen at lowest brightness mobile data off and use only WiFi, but even then the battery does not last for more than 6-8 hours
 However given a phone of this screen size I guess that all right
 Getting the back cover off is a pain but it is somewhat easier if you start by prying the back off from the micro USB port on the phone
 The phone performance is good but still leaves me wishing it had more RAM - especially while using apes like Skype.
 During voice calls twitching to another pp causes Type to crash or the call to get dropped - him not sure if this has got something to do with the Type pp itself or the phone memory management
 Similarly while twitching between apply I often see that some apes load all over again after a simple app-switch.
 I am now eagerly waiting for the Android 5.0 updated

 His is one of the best phone that i have used till now
 It ask you can get different phone with similar or superior specie
 The reason why i choose the phone is because it has promised andros lollypop updated
 Secondly it is one the best device which is easier to hold at this size
 I like big screen honest
 The only thing that i have is the battery
 2600mah battery should have been used
 Well with this battery him obey

 Writing this review after using the phone for 3 weeks
 His is my first smart phone and I am happy for choosing Motorola.Initially, I felt phone volume is less worst both music player and call volume
 After using it for few days I felt its adequate
 I feel battery could be enhanced with more back time as it drains fast
 Dear camera is good but front camera is not offering 2 meg pipes quality
 Advantages 1.Economic phone with more features 2.Fast browsing 3. Enhanced Memory Disadvantages 1.Battery back up 2.Rear camera picture quality

 Battery : it could be better but still in mix usage like turn off sync,3g data location while u r not using giving back more than 1 day ice 1.6d, on ideal state it drains very less
 performance : 4.5/5 look n fill : 4.5/5 network : 3/5 some times call has some problem during talk,and noise is there camera : 4/5 low shutter speed,gives nice shoot on day verdict For normal usage go for it

 Shone camera is very nice

sekher m
 very sad to say ... moto g 2 gen is not a good phone and still moto g first generation is far better then this phone sons : 1 poor battery and first gen was praised for its battery life 2 heating issue when we use the phone for a while 3 poor flipkart service they delivered me the phone only after 13 days and also the product was defective and they replaced with another defective product .
 ( non stop poor customer service from flipart) 4 non availability of moto phone with other online shopping sites makes us to no choice to get from flipkart and my personal opinion that all moto products bust be available in all online shopping site so that we can have fair play since flipkart is providing poor service we can switch to some other provide but this is not happening so blame on MOTOROLA 5 1 go ram lowest among other competitors in the same price range even though phone does it lag that much but once u load more apes u can find considerable amount of lag in the phone
 6 charge or phone is similar to RAHUL DRAVID getting 100 runs in 375 balls ... i have used so many devices never ever seen a phone that gets nearly 3 his to get charged and i dont know wat charges are provided with this pon 7 another in box accesories is hear phone and very poor quality even micromax hear phone that they give for NITRO which is also in the price bracket is good
 over all UNHAPPY with the device and very much FEDUP with FLIPKART service ........ motorola please look into the issue and help us ... one man can satisfy all the needs of india ... lets try to be practice and encourage fair trade and also there by increase the customer satisfaction
 all the above comments are my own and i faced all those difficult mentioned as sons over there sorry to mention only one PRO is NOTHING.
 regards sheer

 I bought the phone on the day of its release but wanted to wait a while before I review it
 To here it is The basis its got a dual SIM, quand core processor Android Mitka waiting for Android 5.0 update!!), 8MP camera primary and 2MP in front really good sound quality thanks to the dual front speakers very good battery life expandable storage screen resolution is good
 Took wise good took sleek and with a little extra money you can spice it up with a colourful back cover versus the default black
 That else do you want in a phone
 I am very happy with my buy
 him still trying to find faults and will update if I do
 But none so far
 Edit Sky I remembered one fault
 The charger that comes with it is ridiculous how can you have a non-removable data cable charge
 its a one piece and apparently it heat up
 To have been using my old Bony Peri charge which is so much better

 West phone under 15000 till now with getting latest updates... Its better than any other phone....
 You must be thinking of buying Android One but it both has Gros and sons Particularly Sons are more as it gets baggy when doing some hard gaming It has a small screen which ruins the gaming experience....
 It has MediaTek Processor which is not up to the mark....
 Of we do a vs bow MediaTek and Snapdragon.... Snapdragon wins.... Moto G and Men has a inch os display which is great for gaming Android One has Camera issues as it has only a 5MP Camera Moto G and Men have a Slo-Mo feature which makes it more creative Android One has 1700mAh battery whereas Moto G and Men has got a 2070mAh massive Battery Android one has only 2 sensory and Moto G and Men has 4 sensory Motorola's Built Quality is great Motorola's built pp called 'Motorola Assist features a helping hand wherever you are....

 I guns Product was attractive and good in condition To complaints about moto G2.
 Good handling good camera even during night
 Good battery than samson those i have used yet
 Only no offers with products
 Over all best for prices
 Touch and handling also good
 Only i have not tested with GPS as i heard from my friend he also has moto G2.
 He says phone gets little bit heat but SAR getting is High than samson phone but within limits provided by government of Indian
 check or phone SAR rating press *#07# and keep or health better
 i would like to say thanks to seller they have provided good products
 But can u guns provide some offers with product or those who have already taken another product from same seller like another phone same modern or not same model vice versa
 so they should give some offers or discount in cost referring old order not
 so the buyer and seller relation of trust will increase and seller can increase their sell
 It will much appreciated if seller will contact us and give some offers to there old buyers
 waiting feedback or reply from seller
 Os i have already taken Moto Os and One samson grand Crime from same os seller
 I am planning to take another samson grand prime but within one week os seller have increased there product price around 800rs already there product price is higher compare to other seller then why again they are increasing prices
 His will affect there sell
 I ordered Moto Os on with it at 12999rs.
 then Samsung Grand Crime at 15056 os on th Sov and received by th Sov But now i wanted to Order another Samsung Grand Crime but its price shows 15893 os
 Request u to give some offers or reduce the product price otherwise it will affect or sell or people will move to other seller
 Even also i am thinking same let see waiting for any feedback from seller
