 Vice phone to have in the segment...Only problem which I found was that the ear phone quality is not at all good
 Moto needs to work a lot on there earphones.

 A much hoped phone from Motorola.
 I was happy with the initial touch & feel
 But as soon as I started installing the bare essential Apps, the phone processing speed reduced drastically.
 It has only been a week & the Pp take a lot of time to load...even making phone calls looks to be painful task with the wait due to the slow speed
 The Moto E which is much cheaper than the Moto G has a better & much faster processing speed
 I would not recommend this product at all

 That made flipkart different from other tailors was its customer service
 I afraid it is no more the same
 First they confirm and then deny shamelessly
 That a downfall
 Putting on hold all the future purchases from Flipkart.

 Flipkarts selling the go for 10,999 while the phone mr is only 9,999.
 Or is maximum retail prices which is determined by the manufactures
 Telling goods above its mr is illegal at-least in Indian
 Wonder how many such products have gone unnoticed !
 Was a loyal customer till date feeling created now !

 I am writing this review after using Moto G gen 2 for over 210 days and evaluation it on every parameter including battery life , performance , build quality sound quality , camera quality etc Initially when I got this product it was working on Mitka 4.4.4 and at that time the battery back and performance of this phone was pretty good
 The multitasking was too good and fluent.
 Shone doesn laws while playing games but it heats).with
 moderate use of Os , If the juice lasts unto 15 his .
 But after dating my phone to lollipop 5.0.2 .
 the performance of my device started increasing and so as the battery life
 Any apes which was crashing every now then was fixed by subsequent updated .
 But the performance parameter of the phone goes on decreasing, phone laws and become responsive and then for a moment you think B ram is not sufficient
 The front shorter of the device is ok for all your video calls and self but the images from the rear shorter are quite dull and lacks smoothness The dual firing speakers provide decent sound quality and are quite loud
 But the come bars used in speakers attract and traps dirt and dust Battery performance goes on increasing day by day now after 7 months my battery last only for 6 hours with wife and Os on whereas it takes 4 hours to charge using motorola charger Overall design Quality is good and economic this phone can be well operated by single hand .
 I would recommend not to waste money in this phone because there are lots of cheaper and better option are available in the market with Os , and 2GB ram option .

 I bought the Moto G and Generation delivered in July 2015.
 The price charges to me was Os 10,999 whereas the MRP mentioned on the webster is Os
 9,999.
 His is gross negligence on part of Flipkart.
 They are importing the product at Os 9,999 so that they have to pay less duty and charging the buyers Os 10,999.
 To all buyers please be aware

 It is good and always recommended by me
 But as per the usage I realized it is heavy outdated and hangs a lot
 Hang is a reason of andros used roughly

 Though I find it comfortable

 I have received Moto Os on st July as a replacement
 Placed replacement order because of battery issue and screen issue
 I am not satisfied with the performance of it
 CONS: Screen issue it shows vertical dotted lines when opening phone in sunlight which i does not see in friends moto go phone .
 It is difficult to use it in sunlight .
 Battery back very poor
 Reduced to 40% in half an hours
 Performance is very poor
 Round automatically increased while playing games ,

 Ought this product a month ago for my sister and now I am seeing MOTO G and genu everywhere around me
 The most advantageous thing about Motorola is you get the latest andros version
 To here are some Gros and Sons of Moto G and Men Rose 1. Expandable Memory which is best according to me because my Moto X doesn have this feature 2.Corning Gorilla Glass 3 : but not as unable as Moto X screen is delicate 3 Camera os os Dear Camera 2 os Front Camera which is feasible according to the price 4. â€¢1.2 The Qualcomm Had More Processor which is an essential thing Sons Display It has IPS LED display but when you see the screen from the side it goes greenish this doesn happen to OLED display Sometimes phone gets heated due to multiprocessing One of my friend got faulty battery indicator , after charging the phone to 100% within 5-10 minutes it goes down to 75% but issue got fixed by Motorola.
 In conclusion the phone is worth buying for the price range of 10-15k !!!!

 His is just a quick review
 The phone is awesome and offers good value for money
 I have used the st gen phone for over a year and till date with multiple apes running there is no lag or battery drain as such
 Summarizing - its a great phone for this prices
 Superb display good camera decent battery and storage space
 It should easily serve for 2 years with zero complaints
 I had ordered 2 pieces and found that 1 of it had a crack in the display
 Thanks for a quick replacement from WSRetail.
 Not the replacement within 2 days

 Hello Beams MRP Showing on BOX is 9999 then why it is listed as 10999 in FLipkart.
 and on top of it you have given me 2000 press discount for my old phone
 I am more concerned if MRP is 9999 as per BOX then why it is prices at 10999 in flipkart.

 I bought this product on and June 2015 and with no surprise Flipkart delivered this phone to me on 24th.
 The phone had vibration and noise on receiver speaker
 I returned the product and received a new piece in no time
 But unfortunately I had the same problem with new piece also
 I predicted that the lot itself might have this issue and raised a return request again
 To my surprise customer care adviser asked me to go to service centre of motorola.
 An why should I carry your non-working device to service centre for repair
 When this guy asked me to rest the device and rejected my request of return
 Although my device is performing better after factory rest but my question is when we are ordering a fresh device then why do we need to troubleshoot any problems
 Highly disappointed

 His phone functions up to the mark and all that but if you are expecting any kind of after sales support and service from motorola, forget it
 I mean just forget it
 Motorola will raise hands when you go to them for any problems regarding your phone
 And Now they dont cover physical damages at all under warrant then seriously what is the warranty even for
 I will tell you to please reconsider your choice and buy some phone other than any motorola and somewhere other than flipkart.

 The phone was replaced least 2 times first time the the SIM card slot doens't work and flipkart support is such a horrible experience to deal with...
 They ask to rest the phone for os problem!!!
 The technical team can only call at their predestined time and if you miss 1-2 times then that it... you need fix another appointment with them
 Even meeting os may be easier than talking to Flipkart technical support people
 Even after telling the proper address they ship to wrong address and comes back and tell you have given wrong address
 Finally after a hell lot of struggle they gave a new phone which is to my surprise the speaker doesn work!!! Again the same round of dealing with teach support
 Finally requested for refund
 All this took more than a month since there was stock shortage during the time
 Long with the phone I purchased a lip cover took now when I asked why dont you take it since this is of no use for me and refund money since you have given non working products Flipkart people are very adamant that they canst do anything and you deal with it!!! Flipkart is not going to help customers and its going to be history soon I think...

 I bought the phone 6 months ago
 It was working fine until last month when its having network issues
 It loses cellular network signal very often and even the 2G/3G GPRS signal
 I use Hittel network and from last 10 years or so haven had a problem with my phone not catching cellular network Os was using Foka primarily and Solo for few months
 I have had few of my friends having similar issues as well
 Excruciatingly annoying when i want to make a call or receive an important message and network isn there
 hats the point of having good speck when the phone does catch the cellular network required for phone call message / internet browsing
 I suggest to go for other phone with good connectivity.
 There are loads of models available in market at the same price with same or better speck / features and connectivity.

 But the battery life
 I love my Moto go to the core very user friendly great GUI awesome experience
 The only problem is that the battery life
 Its more like dead
 Of Novo has a GUI like Moto I would definitely prefer Lenovo.
 The radiation emitted is a bit high than Novo and as iv said dead battery life
 Still I recommend to buy this mob
 You can definitely get an awesome experience
 North the money except battery

 After using shone 4 almost for 3-4 years I decided to go for android, but I dont want to spend lots of money on fancy phone like Samsung and Bony which has good issue and users are crying after spending 20k+.
 I bought this Moto Os for my wife almost a year back and I was impressed with Moto Os performance in terms of camera quality surely its battery then iPhone), battery pp updated etc Trust me i spend almost a month to found a good andros phone which is under ask which comes with a established bands and also comes with internal memory of 16 os or more
 It has a decent processor good display and an good camera in class
 The biggest drop back I found that Moto doesn provide USB cable to connect with system
 That we need to buy from separately
 I used this phone for almost a month and I feel it is perfect replacement of shone some feature I still miss in android).
 Its really a value for money and must to have phone under 11k.

 Us I am writing this review after 1 month of usage of the phone
 Believe me its an amazing products
 It first I was resistant to buy it just because of the after sales service co Motorola doesn have direct presence in Indian
 But found that they have pretty good number of service centres in my city atleast.
 Os far as the product is concerned it works very well with great display and features
 I also got Android lollipop reloaded on the phone
 I sometimes feel that a 2GB RAM would have been an iting on the cake but nevertheless it works fantastically.
 I have also download a few heavy games and they also run fine except that the phone responds a little slower but only for a few seconds
 Overall highly satisfied
 Had there been an option of 4.5 stars I would have marked it the same

 I had been using a Samsung Galaxy Os for the past two and a half years and the phone was giving me any number os problems including a very poor battery life
 I had to permanently leg a portable charger around
 Ordered Moto Os on Flipkart; pleasantly surprised to have it delivered in two days not counting the Sunday in between
 Os of now I am happy with the way with the product looks the efficient performance and the long battery life
 I use a lot of apes on the phone including a fair number of business apply
 its too quick to do a full review but the phone functions well without a lag even when twitching between different programs
 I like the fact that Moto has not fiddle much with the Android OS, which translated to a much smoother sanctioning and user experience
 I have been using the phone non-stop since I received it and as of now I am very happy with the products
 I can do a detailed review a month later
 Looks wise the screen is pretty big I would have preferred it to be sleeker thought
 I bought the white version and I will be buying a couple of Moto back covers soon to change the look as and when I get bored

 I ordered this phone on 20th-June and pay extra money for fast delivery
 The phone was delivered on 21st-June.
 From very first day neither the Tic nor the speaker was working
 Even the second him slot was not functional
 I raised the return request very same day
 The return request was rejected twice for no reason
 After constant follow-ups and running pillar to post the return request was approved yesterday
 It is mentioned that the replacement will be delivered on 6th-July To after paying the full money and extra bucks for fast delivery I am left with no functional phone for 16 days
 I am not sure what if the replacement phone also not works
 His agonizing experience with Flipkart has shattered my faith this brand name
 Seems we as a customer are just money papers holding no value for Flipkart.
 I can say that this was my last shopping on Flipkart and in future I will refrain from dealing with Flipkart.
 Now that there are better and bigger Grands providing better services and customer satisfaction I will go for them to avoid any such painful experience
 I felt Like CHEATED by Flipkart....!!!!!

 I loved the phone in all aspects in terms of performance battery back up camera
 The biggest problem with the phone was however the battery charging point
 The phone suddenly stopped taking charge and after the battery was discharged It became useless
 I had no option but to ask for a replacement from flipkart which I got within 4 days
 Its a different matter that I had difficulties to make the Must
 Service Yes understand that the phone had crashed and was not charging
 I used the new phone for about a week or so and lo and behold it had the same problems
 I promptly returned and asked for my money back was was done within 2 days
 I would still love to get the phone but with the battery issue sorted
 Moto are you listening!!!!!

 That I Round - - Battery drains quickly
 - Camera is not up to the mark (iPhone is much better even with 8MP) - Smooth Running - Battery drains quickly
 - Scared about other reviews screen might break if you drop the phone Although i am confused with Gorilla Glass os it should never break isn it
 - Battery drains quickly
 - Shone heat when first run - Battery takes ages to charge but drains quickly You must be wondering why I have repeated the same thing few times
 Because i wanted to eating highlight the main problem of this phone....!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Its has only 2000mh battery which is lower than the version 1... not at all suitable for smartphones.
 It dont even lasts 10 his with minimal usage
 Of you get more calls then its has to be always kept plugged in
 With this phone you get 0.5A charger which takes 6-8 his to fully charge the phone
 what is like in this phone is just the slim look and the latest version
 Haste of money

 After three months of usage I found this phone to be bad in performance
 PRO: Sterno Speakers CON: Door Battery Life doesn last for more than 24 his for average use and no crazy apes installed
 The OS itself is drawing heavily from battery
 Battery Extension is a humbug
 When enabled it Buggy software Seats up fast during call or data usage Sometimes phone rings but doesn let to answer call wiping does nothing Sometimes clinking on contact in dealer does nothing this piece of cap doesn let to make call till a report is done Bootup screen is 200% bright and lasts for a cool 2 minutes strains eye when starting at lowliest areas
 It takes more than 5 minutes to start and get the smaller pp launching
 Sometimes Google Caps icon keep rotating celebrating compass doesn help

 Of you think Moto G was a great launch and in and generation they provide something extra..answer is yes they do
 Camera quality has improved screen size has increased looks better
 But performance has gone down
 Terrible earphones and charge
 Shone hangs all the time
 Of you think you are getting better product in less prices they are footing us

 I have 2*Moto G st Men 1*Moto G and genu os Moto X st gen and 1*Moto X and gen phone - all purchased thou Flipkart.
 Across honest including Moto G and genu the perpetual problem is that despite the claims of a Gorilla 3 screen all the screens are extremely fragile
 The replacement of screens is prohibitive expensive (E.g.
 Moto X st gen screen replacement is Os 12,540/-).
 Worst part is that their service centers are NOIT Motorola dedicated ones - they use shared service centers that also cater to many Heap Chinese bands
 Of you wrote to the company no one cares you call them no one listens
 NOT really a value for money phone
 To point buying a phone and repenting in 1 months
 ANYONE os MOTOROLA LISTENING?
 (NB: Of I hear from Motorola, all update this positively
 In past I even made a SVP from Motorola USA to write to Indian eyes but no one cared to responded

 I have bought this product 3 months back and visited the service center 2 times for various issues screen and touch
 It worked very fine for the first week then the screen problem started immediately after the flipkart warranty period ended
 The response form the flipkart is very poor and asked me to visit near service center which is 30kms from my place
 From them i started making rounds around the service center with various problems
 I can suggest good mobile are available in market other than this where they can have more service centers near to their home
 unfortunately now also I am using the same noble as i am not able to spend more money on buying other worst mobile on flipkart.
 To for other than moto if you are staying in Andhra trades os telangana.

Pawanjit Singh...
 Very unsatisfied with the battery backup.
 Shone takes around 2.5 hours to full charge and get drains quicker than it if you brows over internet and use apply
 I have to turn off the data conductivity to save battery what is the point of having smart phone if you cannot use internet and apes continuously and compromise due to bad battery backup?
 Earlier I owned Motorola Limestone that was a remarkable product by Motorola, that is the reason I had gone for Motorola product once again but Moto Os is a big disappointment

Subhankar Ghosh
 I have been using this mobile phone since 2 months ago
 His mobile is excellent in performance,display,sound. Camera quality is good
 But at present according to price this phone is not up to the mark because you can get more features with less price from other mobile like Novo a6000 plus,lenovo a 7000, Huawei Honor etc
 But one think you should keep in mind that is this phone does not launch along with above mentioned model
 Of you want to compromise with features according to price then this the best choice
 Also I want to mention here that Moto G(2nd Men design and quality is very nice
 But there is little bit disadvantage is there that is the battery is not powerful of this phone

 His is an amazing phone with crystal clear camera which has beaten the camera of my Note 2 same 8MP/2MP).

 It never heat up or it rarely hang only once after the update to 5.1).
 It almost runs every high end games
 In short Later Resistance dual speakers obviously the camera are the USP of this phone

 200% satisfied with the product.Full of advantages
 U can imagine another mobile for this rock bottom price with such a awesome specie
 Using the phone for past 5 months & within this 5 months time I bought another 2 Moto-G for my Had & Sis).
 Ought this in 3 different prices Web 2015 - Rs.13000 War 2015 - Rs.10000 since of Flipkart Pp big day discount and 10% discount on AXIS cards June 2015 - Rs.9000 since of Flipkart Pp big day discount and 10% discount on SBI cards Rose Not to be listed
 I see tones of Gros in this Shone
 Some which haven been mentioned by other reviews I would like to share it 1. Service is very good
 Of your product is within warranty you are 100% secured with zero penny wasted
 2. Accessories are damn cheap next Charger - Rs.350, Earphones - Rs.250) Sons 1.
 Of phone switched off with dry battery it takes minimum 15 mind to gain os battery
 Total charging time to gain full battery is also too too slow but battery back up is very good compared to other smartphones with 16M colors Verdict os os GO..!!!!!! Buy this and enjoy rest of your time..!!!! WSRetail and Flipkart Locks in their service by prompt delivery..!!!!!

 I purchase Moto G and Generation).
 But it did not suit me accordingly so returned it to Flipkart.
 Now my findings are Sons os Battery percentage not displayed in status bare
 os To enable mobile data we have to click simultaneously 3 times from tongue quick settings to settings
 3 - Issue with battery
 Takes too much time to charge almost 4 hours
 4 - Battery drops down inconsistently.
 Again revert to old percentage on restarted
 5 - Any bags on software
 6 - Snapdragon 400 is old nowadays
 Snapdragon 410 on other phone such as Novo A6000, Novo A6000 Flush Xiaomi Semi os Honor Os works much better
 os Seats up sometimes a little on gaming and video calling
 8 - To clear all function in task witchery
 Gros 1 - Amazing built quality 2 - OS updated
 The best feature of all 3 - Grand Same 4 - Excellent customer support and service center
 To for this device if the above sons suits you

 Purchased the phone from Flipkart on word June 2015.
 The SIM cards do not get detected
 They need micro aims for MOTG.
 Cried using 4-5 different him cards however the aims do not get detected
 It is really disappointing when FLIPKART pushes a product under the flipkart advantage scheme stating the products and sellers are verified
 Os this the kind of products that will be sold
 I have asked for replacement of the same
 Will keep you updated

Rohisha Thulas...
 It is just a day since my purchase of Moto G so my review is purely based on this one day usage
 I had wanted a phone with a decent camera decent display under 10000.
 Thanks to the 3 day offer by flipkart on June 22-24, I got my hands on this phone for just 7000 in exchange offer
 To far the phone has satisfied all my needs
 The packing by Flipkart was good and neat and my phone was delivered without any defect or mistaken
 Good things about Moto Os 1.
 The display is good and class
 Doesn't look cheap at all
 Gives a premium look 2. The performance of the phone is good under normal usage
 Pp open quickly without any last
 I have not played any games yet so canst comment on the performance with respect to games 3. Automatic brightness is available which is a good things
 He dont have to adjust the brightness every time
 Sunlight viewing is also comfortable
 I did not find any issues with it
 4. The build quality matched my expectations
 It looks similar to Nexus series of honest i compared my phone with the nexus phone that my colleagues had and found no difference in the build quality 5.
 The battery is not draining on standby.
 I left the phone at 65% when I went to bed and the next morning the charge was 64%.
 His was impressive
 The battery also lasts for unto one and half days on moderate usage whatsapp - 1-2 hours checking facebook 2-3 times a day browsing internet for 1 hours voice calls 1 hours video play back - 1 hours using camera for 15-20 min ) 6.
 The front sterno speakers are really good and it impressed me a lot
 I liked listening to few songs on the speakers 7. The camera clarity was good
 The HDR mode makes the photos look brighter and clearer
 There was no shutter last
 8. 16 os memory 9. Morning Gorilla Glass 3 Things I didn like about Moto Os 1.
 The headphones that come in box are not good
 They are below average 2. The call quality could have been better
 Though i kept the call volume at maximum i still had trouble listening to the voice on the other side
 The voice is not clear on calls
 3.
 To file manager pp
 I dont mind the sons that much
 Overall i love the phone
 I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a budget phone with good quality
 Full 5 stars for the phone

 First of all i am surprised that Motorola have not provided any of its address in India at its webster I have purchased Moto Os in April 2015 with a faulty him card sloth but when i went to service center for repair/replace they are saying that it was done forceful and i will be charged extra for the same i agreed to him and have given the hands for repair
 But till date my hands is lying with the service center only
 Motorola office is telling that they have sent the parts and the hands is repaired but till date i have not received back my handset.
 The customer care executive gives false assurance every week and they often discontent the call by keeping in hold
 I am totally dissatisfied by the service

 I am using it from january with 2015 .
 Will then the problem I faced is that it large a bit .
 It gets heated up very much when net is running and when I am attending a call simuatneously.
 The battery life is normal though its not giving according to expectation
 The pictures shot by its camera is good but when its copied to os and seen , gives not good quality of pick as compared to samson andros honest
 Must after 1 month of using the phone it got heated up in such an extent that it was giving me a smell of burning PCB.
 Recently I have reported a problem that sometime when a call is coming I can pick it up as the touch to receive a call is not working .
 Overall the experience is average .

 Cannot express my disappointment and frustration with Flipkart the and product quality
 Not the phone exchanged once and the second time is no better
 inspire of calling the customer care since a month soon after the delivery for n number of time finally they saying my service period is reached because its over a months
 and since a month did all the troubleshooting and smart check steps as i was told to do
 And they cannot do anything os are they bidding !
 Such bad service never expected
 Footing the customers
 WORST experience in online shopping
 Wont To for this Shone Especially from flipkart.

 His guns always gives you some lame reason why they have not repaired my phone everyday.My phone is still with them
 Us please be cautious while you take your phone to these service centre One the very first they will tell you to come next without asking you about the problem in the phone,they will keep your phone .
 I am really passed off from the service of Motorola.
 I am happy with the performance of my phone but service centre sucks os Please Motorola at least show some respect to customers

 His mobile glass display is vulnerable to break if it falls
 By mobile had fallen accidentally and replacing the display costs Rs.4500/- which is close to 40% of the product value
 His is a delicate product unlike Samsung(even if it falls still works and go for this only if it is handled like baby !
 It is not worth spending on lip covers for this mobile

 Earlier I have purchased a Micromax A Micro 311 but requested for refund/replacement due to the lag in every specification
 To given negative rating for that and badly reviewed
 After refusal from ws-retail seller I have sold that phone to my friend on a cheaper prices
 Now I after purchasing this Moto G2, given this as a gift to wife and she is totally happy with this
 Shone is working as per its specification
 I hear good points everyday from her that she is enjoying her gift
 Finally Hats-off flipkart this time
 Expect this only with Flipkart and their sellers like ws-retail.

 Never buy any Motorola product in Indian
 I bought Moto Os three months ago and it starts heating up while keep it on for charging
 I gave my phone for repair to authorized Motorola Service Centre
 They kept it for more than 2 weeks and returned it as it is without repairing my phone since they couldn find any solution
 I missed couple of important calls during this 2 week period
 By phone was under warranty but when i called Toll-free Customer Are they refused to replace my phone

 The phone seemed to work well for first couple of weeks
 After that a major part of touchscreen is not responding phone hanging and other software glitches.
 Have requested return
 Surprised to know about the tortuous return policy at lip part
 One customer service representative informs me that unless the diagnostic pp is installed no replacement possible
 I try my best to them understand that because the phone touchscreen is not working properly i am unable to install the pp
 Finally another customer service representative informs that it need to be taken to nearest lip part repair center
 After the mortification from the technical service center the phone may be replaced
 To i need to take the phone to the service center,get report from them scan and email the report to lip part
 Why so much troubles for customers already suffering a loss of their time money and the inconvenience caused by a defective productive
 By the called motorola mobility service center which recommended me a replacement
 Its the lip part that is causing problems
 Buyers beware

 Sky so the phone is quite good laws sometimes but you can fix that with clean master download from playstore) anyway lollipop takes a lot of battery you may know but i have used the moto e must genu for 1 years and 4 months with lollipop, with 1990 may but still i dont get as bad battery life as this phone
 this phone battery life is pathetic..... it had come to a level of such frustration that i looked up this problems
 the problem was the update of andros 5.0.2, lollipop.
 in andros 4.4, the battery lasted an entire day
 so i suggest u download something as simple as nova launched because goose now and goose pp it self takes a lot of battery
 a way temporary way to fix the problem is to go to recovery mode and clear the ache partition which you can look up on couture or yakov answers anyway all in all the phone is good but the battery drained this review you can hardly use like a normal phone
 thanks - Bishop

 it has been 48 his there has been no response on that

 Built Quality of this phone is good
 Display Quality is Good
 Battery back is average but not BAD.
 Stock Android Locks with this phone
 Speaker and voice quality is awesome.
 Dual Him Works perfect with this phone
 Superb Network capturing even at the places where network is sporadic
 To Heating problems at all only thing is Motorola should increase the RAM of this mobile to at least 2 os for advance users those usually use more applications and games
 I know 1GB RAM is suffice the need of general users but new application those are coming now days requires more RAM to operate them seamlessly, else i would say Moto G stands apart from crowd that the reason behind its huge success
 keep it up Motorola.
 Thanks Distant Os

 By previous three smartphones have all been HTC Android devices
 I decided to try the Moto G (2gen) after seeing Moto G and Moto X with friends
 I had the following requirements * Android Lollipop * Sufficient internal storage to let me install lots of apes my previous phone had just 4 GB, which was not enough * dual SIM I also wanted a phone not a phablet.
 I would be very reluctant to go for a 5.5" screen for instance
 The Moto G is great
 All quality data connectivity, wife reliability are all very good
 By last phone the HTC Desire 600, used to drop wife random and repeatedly
 The 16 os internal storage gives me more than 12 os free after system software and bundles apply
 His is more than enough for lots of apply
 Unlike the gen device this one has a MicroSD sloth which allows for a lot of the apes and data to be moved to the os cards
 I dont get any HTC enhancements to the UI os I get just stock Lollipop here
 But I am finding it quite unable
 Some things dont work as expected but they are Lollipop problems
 I should not dwell on them in a phone review
 I also bought a Motorola lip cover for the phone which replaces the back cover and fits on the body very well
 I love this cover because opening the flip-top switches on the screen without me having to hit the power button
 Very nice touch
 Os used to keep twitching on the screen just to check the time since my telephone has been my watch for the last few years
 I will highly recommend this accessory
 Have not used the supplied headset, so I canst comment on its quality
 I have used the headset output with my Etymotic HF2 and ER4-PT IEMs and the sound quality is excellent os its all you can expect without a dedicated headphone amp
 Adequate volume took
 The Bluetooth paring with my Plantronics Voyage Legend is very solid os I dont find Bluetooth paring drop-outs as I used to find occasionally with my HTC.
 I have done unto two hour-long tele-conferences using GoToMeeting and Type using this phone and my Voyage Legend with the phone online on 3G.
 It works well
 Am not a camera so I canst comment on game performance
 I find it hard to justify the price of an expensive HTC 826 after experiencing this phone

 I am using this phone since Dec 14 and it has been very good
 I have no complaints
 Battery is good speed / performance has not deteriorated
 I mostly use the phone for calling some times as camera or music
 I must say the camera is amazing the pictures are awesome.
 Music is OK.
 Bluetooth conductivity with my car phone is instantaneously
 Before I forget motorola migrate is an excellent utility it transferred all the data / apes / contact et from my samson note to moto go it was so convenient that I did not find a single inconvenience twitching to a new phone
 By recommendation is go for it
 Only down side I find is using the dual him
 When one him is being used the other him callers get out of coverage message
 Other than this all is good

 A short and crisp review to make your decision
 USPs: 1. Grand ( n that it 2. Y Shouldn't you buy : a
 The gorilla glass as claimed shatters if it fall from a height of say 3 feet.The glass shattered within 2 weeks of buying and the replacement comes for 6-7k.(Was
 using a micromax earlier though it want a gorilla glass but never broke even if fallen multiple time by
 Heating Issue
 c
 The accessory headphone will stop working if not handled with care
 do
 Service centres are not unapproachable over phone e
 The battery doesn lasts more than 8 his if fully charged
 West every thing is fine.Even if you wish to purchase it you can but I suggest there are better phone available in this range.Why pay more for a high brand off quality products

Hangs during i...
 Most of the times when I receive oncoming call the phone hangs and I am unable to lift it but good thing is we have a workaround for this
 By pressing the power button twice we can lift sometimes
 For SIM issue we need to start the phone then only it defects the SIM.
 Battery is draining like anything
 Not Referable if you are looking for a good battery life
 It drains in 5 hours

Ashish Vedula
 Hello there him a 17 year old boy who bought this phone recently and so this is my honest review for this phone
 There are many pro for this phone which you might've already seen in other reviews so him donna list some important sons about this phone . .
 1).
 Battery - Honestly this is the worst battery back have seen on any phone till date
 But so they totally depend on ones usage
 Of you play some heavy games and play some music then brows for about an hour and then check Couture you might get disappointed as you might've to charge it twice a day
 But the same phone if my father uses he gets around 60% back remaining after a full day usage
 His usage is like he frequently make or attend calls then if got some free time checks WhatsApp or Facebook, this is his full day usage
 Os it might be or might not be a deal breakers for some . .
 2).
 Charger - Again the battery takes too much time to charge with its default charge
 It takes around 7-8 hours for me to charge it from 15% to 100% as the output is only 0.5 Imp
 But if you change your charger having an Output of 1 Imp
 then still charge in approximately 1 hour 30 minutes
 But dont risk your phone by buying some Chinese charge do buy some branded charge
 And yes the charger does not have a detachable cable which could work as a Micro-USB cable for your PC.
 Os buy separately a Micro-USB cable . .
 3).
 Lollipop - His is not the problem with phone but with its Software
 The UI is slightly sluggish
 It doesn mean it hangs a lot you'll rarely see some lag on it
 The latest update by Google which is installed on this phone is Lollipop v5.0.2.
 Users who bought this phone with Mitka said the phone was battery smooth before installing the Lollipop updated
 Even the issue with Battery Lockup is because of Lollipop as Google officially said it and so Google released Lollipop 5.1 which have many improvements including battery backup.
 Motorola has confirmed the Lollipop 5.1 update for Moto G and Generation and other Moto phone but there is no official wording on release date . .
 These are some important sons about this phone worth to be mentioned
 But dont forget there are many pro as well which might be pleasing for many like me
 Of you think that these sons are deal breakers for you then all suggest you to go for ASUS Zenfone 2 and if you dont have any problem with chinese bands then do check Xiaomi Mi4i.
 Again they've their own sons so choose wisely

 To as I start my review if your looking to buy I i then please dont this is better one..!!
 His phone feels grm in your hand..!!! Its feels as if this phone is handcrafted only for you..!! Coming to the specs.. 1.2 the speed seems to be slow but trust me you can play high end games such as Shalt 8 or soon battery draining fast is an issue..but as it says nothing is perfect in this world..!! Camera is too awesome..!!
 With imp and imp it captures super images.!!! Coming to Display....display is good but not best..!! Judges are often on the screen Round quality is brilliant with dual speaker front camera..!!
 The back cover feels really smooth and grm to hold it your hand..!!
 The best part of this phone is it comes with an expandable memory..!! Which is grm and that mimi doesn provide..!!!
 Of your budget is between 10-12 you must blandly go for this..!!Even after sales-service is also fantastic..!!
 There is a pre loaded pp in every moto phone where we connect with the customer care..!!
 Os this one is just made for you and would definitely impress you..!!! Review written after 3-4 months of use...!!

 3.Flipkart return policy they are footing people by smartchk application.they
 directly deny problem in device using this application
 By device having a problem while making and receiving calls
 I cannot hear any sounds,It has become very frequent.Every time I have to start my phone to set it right and after a few hours the sound goes off again(Known issue for device
 and i got reply from Flipkart "smartchk not showing problem in device and suggested to visit nearest service center
 THIS os BIG BENEFIT os ONLINE SHOPPING, YOU GET "DEVICE ONLINE,NOT SERVICE"

 I suggest you go through the readmit MI4i.
 nice battery
 1.7ghz processor for gazing 3110mah battery
 16 os internal storage
 compare to motorola i suggest mimi is nice&budget phone
 And I request Motorola please design the battery of mobile phone according to its performance & daily use of phone

Ritupan Hazarika
 Overall a great phone at its price range
 Great display
 Excellent battery backup.
 Good Speaker sound
 8MP back camera is quite good at daylight
 Not a good performer at night
 2MP front camera is good enough for selfish
 I have a 16GB memory card which is full of moves
 Shone memory is almost full
 But still it doesn hang/lag.
 But the major issue I observe is that there is no permanent setting for Os only or Os only network mode
 Deep on twitching a lot
 Major issue with the high data users
 Hope Moto will release an update to turn off any of the antenna as per user requirements
 After fixing the issue I will update the stars to 5.

 The decision I made to move from Foka to Motorola was in 2014 start
 Being a big time fan of Foka tried my best to hang with all Gumma series got exhausted and decided to try on andros with motor st genu
 Quiet impressed with UI and playstore and repented for not being moved to andros that long
 His Moto G 2 generation is the th phone in my house from same moto family since they are always reliable less prices with high speck and very easy with UI.
 Good job motor try to reduce your Moto X prices i would go for one of them ll os

 Of you really want a good andros phone under rs.15000) then look no further Moto g and gen is the right phone u r looking at...:)
 You must have read the speck n features in the "specifications" section so i wont go over that
 Must co speck dont matter a lot
 His is a ridiculously fast phone and that is because it runs stock andros with just a few motorola additions
 Overall it is a very good phone
 Os of now there is a bit competition in the market with phone like Mi3, Mi4i, Us Zenfone os Us Zenfone os etc but as per my thinking Moto G is a lot lot better than those
 The feel in the hand is awesomeee os The audit quality is the best at this price point via the front facing sterno speakers
 I wished the speakers to be less wider and black in colour but still okk...
 I loved the slow motion recording from the rear 8 os Camera and the camera shutter speed is also gud... Well i found out that the battery lasted quite well with heavy usage it gave me about 5 to 6 hours of battery backup.
 Of you are a normal user then it will easily last you a full day before 9 pm in night according to my test but still its god as u can plug in a charger at night..... Well that all for this review if you found it helpful ply do hit the thumb up button below it may help others

 For 12999 its not worth it
 its okay to buy for 7000 to 8000 Used for 5 months Sons os RAM onlyyyyy 1 GB.
 Not GOODDD.
 Any apes get closed (Google Chrome,etc).
 os Takes 4 his to charge
 os Battery of 2070 may not enough for 5 inch Screen
 Hence Battery Sucks
 os with Single Him it works properly
 But when i start using with Dual him
 Network comes and go every time
 when i start internet in Him than Him Becomes emergency and vice-versa.
 os with Os net it will drain in 3.5 hours and will take another 4 hours to full charge os Seats many times (FYI - never played single game or ran any heavy application os Charge was getting heat up like a sun
 than replaced it on Motorola Service center
 But still its heating
 os During call its getting over heated
 From os Camera is Good
 os Very smooth never gets Hang os Right and Good Looking os In Stand by Battery is very Good (Kudos All batteries are Good at Stand By ) os All quality is very good os Front speaker is one good idea
 I liked it

 Dear all His was my first purchase of smart phone and i chose Flipkart as they always ensure timely delivery of items wherever we are
 I ordered this phone on with May 2015 and got exactly on with June 2015.
 I was worrying as my working place is near by a small village called Balipara in Sam but Flipkart did a wonderful job and it surprised most of my colleagues as the place is away from town and we thought that the delivery would be time consuming
 Though i have already Microsoft Gumma 630 phone i was in dilemma to choose whether lucia or any andros devices and finally selected moto g and generation as very a few of my friends have been using the same and are satisfied with its performance
 Must a week got over after its use i cannot give much points about it but some points would like to share so that new customers can easily select this smart phone
 Positive 1. Took and body 2. Connectivity 3. User friendly 4. Simple settings 5. Rich andros experience 6. Ready look 7. Easy to handle 8. Unfordable price 9. Good memory 10.
 Rich video experience 11.
 Easy navigation and good wife conductivity 12. Excellent games display
 Negative 1.
 The screen resolution needs to be improved under sun light as it is not up to the mark
 2. It heavy comparing with my Gumma phone
 Purchase only through flipkart as the item is good and safe packing
 Thanks & Regards C.S.Shankar

 To this was the product I thought was a game changes at least in terms of looks and performance and also UI design
 But this also came to end when it dropped off my hand and suffered a lot of scratches on the corners of the screen

 have all four corners whipped now

 1.SCREEN PPI AND COLOR VIVIDNESS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

MUSIC AND SOUND OUTPUT QUALITY NOT GREAT BUT OK, EVEN WITH HEADPHONES. 5. FINGER PRINT MAGNET BACK COVER.
 6. BACK PANEL LITTLE SLIPPERY.
 7. FOR SOME HIGH END GAMES PROCESSOR HAS SOME LAG but the price up and down is always irritating

 Delivery : Hang on delivery !
 Flipkart proved again why they are one of the best
 Not the phone within 2 days of ordering
 Vice packing
 Now discussing about the phone i would like to say that this is a honest review on the basis of 3 weeks of usage and what i have observed
 Instead of giving pro and sons i would like to describe the features of the phone Camera : The asset of this product is the camera features
 8 os Camera provides good clarity
 The example of a good picture was i took a snap of my lawton screen and each and every word of the mail open on the screen was easily and clearly viewable.
 Front camera is quite satisfactory and good for video calls if you are interested
 There are extra features like os quality image and manual focus Sons : There are not many edit features in the camera itself
 Eating : 8.5/10 Battery : Any users are saying this is a big issue since the battery drains very quickly
 To need to worry at all because if you handle the phone fruitful and sensibly you will able to save a lot of battery(Refer to the different battery saving methods
 Besides the phone itself provides a battery save option in battery settings which saves a lot of energy
 Sons : Heavy use may reduce battery life
 Of you are a fan of gaming dont go for it
 James drain the battery a lot
 Drowsing in Os and some basic apes like Whatsapp, facebook and messenger will give you a minimum of 12-14 hours of back provided you follow the battery saving instructions 6/10 Speed : Very good
 Easy multitasking and the phone will provide the latest updated lolypop andros which never causes any hang now
 7.5/10 Round : Average
 Only the basic Moto tune is loud else you to download custom ringtones.
 Speakers are good 7/10 Video : Excellent
 I have seen video and its showing without any lag and crystal clear resolution
 9/10 Additional Features(along with overall pro and cost Took and fill : The phone is slim and very stylish
 Its also hardy providing a gorilla glass screen which protects you from basic scratches
 I have dropped my phone already two times and its safe till now Os However its good to a have a screen guard and back cover for safety 9/10 Gros 1.
 The biggest feature is the ready updated that are provided
 2. The phone is very user friendly and easy to handle 3. Camera is very good in respect to 8 up Sons 1. Battery life in case you are a heavy user and a game os hours max 2. The phone does not provide USB charge
 You have to have a USB cable in case you want to transfers file and songs You can trust and go ahead os Overall review - 8/10

 One of the best phone i have bought so far
 To many people(friends and others have already asked me to go for this beauty,but i was a little skeptically about buying it
 But then somehow i got convince and bought it
 1.
 It was having offer at that time so i got a free genuine motor lip cover
 2. its been 5 months since then and the phone is working like butter
 Never got hung
 NEVER!! 3.It had an issue of battery which only used to last 1 day on a single charge
 But after the lollipop update it has become a little better
 Still satisfactory but not so good
 4.Processor is too good`since it is quand copeland different apes works simultaneously without any last
 5.You can play Asphalt(1.6gb)
 and minimize it at any time and do some other task and get back to the game later and it will all work very fine
 Smooth!! 6.Camera is damn good
 Front camera is just good
 Bags if running on low storage
 7.Phone's storage is too good 12 go for all your apply
 Round quality is good took
 8.STURDY!! Have fallen twice but nothing happens to the screen
 9.
 Last but not the least for the price it is available now in the market is sure is a good offer for any buyers
 You can update it to Lollipop as soon as you buy it

 well I am using the phone for almost a month now and what I should say about this phone well first of all it had plenty of room for improvement one is the charger has a fixed cable another is sorting in the Settings pp is missing,The screen is a little hard to read in direct sunlight but clarity and viewing angles are otherwise good
 The good thing is calling is really better than any smartphone by any means
 and camera is really good
 All in all its a hard handy phone with average look One more thing black one is better looking than the white ones i am using the later

 6 month after using the phone...
 The phone perform well in all the aspects for a phone game updated all is good
 I dont play lot of game but played ASphalt Subways and many for few time no issue with he performance but when coming to Service From Motorola forget it the service is provided by B2X not from MOTOROLA directly my phone screen stopped showing up on a morning suddenly even if the phone was not even dropped from my hand
 When on to service center they said that the phone is damaged due to water took the phone in retiring room and after 5 min they come up with the issue as Having Clot is broken
 Last time i used my phone it was charging but 5 min the phone is broken Not into that they will drop the detailed mail to motorola for same and if they get the permission they will repair it for free... but next day call came and they said it will took 7000 for the phone to be repaired That the for for a 11 k phone if the changing slot is not working 7000k thank god no chip got damaged then they have been said for 15K.. Also contracted MOTOROLA for same but no response yet getting a new phone now but not MOTO this time for sure can take risk for 11 K again...
 Of you are ready to go with the phone considering 30 day warrant only from flipkart go head Great phone remember no warranty like thing from MOTOROLA..!!!

 him posting this review after using Moto Os for two months now
 Order booking process to delivery from Flipkart was on time as always os Stars to Flipkart).
 After an initial week of usage this phone had started creating all sorts of issue possible in a mobile phone
 List is below - 1. Display screen has gone permanently flurry 2. os card is never readable on this device 3. Forgets to detect him card too occasionally 4. Shone laws too much on multiple operations 5.
 And biggest of all problems is the Motorolla service centre (Thane west
 His service centre candles multiple bands of phone not a motorolla stores
 After explaining my problem the solution that I got was pathetic
 Must to get this device checked which is under warranty I have to pay 400 Os on top of that it will take about 12 days for them to get back with the reason for the problems
 I consider this store as fraud they will tell me false reasons about the cause
 Os requested them to inspect in front of me which they denied Request everyone buying a phone is to first check Service centre availability and process
 Most companies Even international nowadays launch cheap quality products in India without any service
 I request Flipkart to help me with the return of this product to manufacturer if possible and exchange my device

 Placed an order on with of May 2015.
 Not the product the next day by evening due to the one day guarantee
 To far so good
 Not a sealed box from the delivery guy
 Opened it up
 Grand new-looking phone
 Awesome.
 Turn it on wipe the screen out of joy see waves form at the middle of the screen from top to bottom in the center of the screen
 Considered normal behaviour I assumed so I let it slide
 The three hardware buttons seemed to be working correctly as well
 15 days later I did some research on the waves I saw on-screen on the first day find out that it usually takes a LOT MORE force than what I applied for that to happen
 hats strike one
 Strike two the volume down button already seems to be sinking into the body
 That the hell
 Normally unheard-of issue
 Strike three would be the flicked when the phone is used at the lowest possible brightness level
 Plain weird display I suspect faulty
 Also important is the fact that the display fails to register touch input at times which is EXTREMELY worrying for a full-touch device
 Thankfully I bought the phone from os Details which has the Flipkart advantage guarantee and its only been about 2 weeks since have been using this phone
 Slightly disappointing have requested for a replacement a second time First one was understandable canceled since I failed to respond to calls the first time I noticed these issues
 Will update my experience as I go

 Overall a good phone in ask range
 But so much hope created is complete truth regarding the phone

 Letter life in 12 hours in 3G, which is also not exceptionally good i feel
 RAM performance i can really feel the difference from my 2GB Mimi MI3, it will remind you both I am just 1 os dont overburdened me whenever you start 3 more apes with facebook.
 Did not play games yet not much expectation

 Thanks to Motorola.
 His item lives up to the expectation of a common man
 It is fast with its Quadro More Snapdragon processor with 1GB ram
 But of 16GB internal memory we get 13GB for other applications to installs
 The camera is awesome, and i have installed 'Camera360 pp which makes good use of the camera
 The battery drains in 24hrs once the mobile data is on and takes 4 to 5 hours to get it full charged
 All together I am fully satisfied with the products

 I have nexus and Samsung galaxy Y however this MOTOG and gen was a bad experience for me because os The display ran into problem and it was a horror story to get it service
 The reason is simple - that there are only 3 service centres for Motorola mobile phone in Bangalore - time for any problem takes 2 months and the service quality is bad
 I gave the phone for service to correct the faulty charging pink but in return got a free problem of my touch screen not working intermittently
 2)The resolution of the phone is not unto the mark
 3)The touch screen is very fragile
 A simple hit can cause the touch screen getting broken
 To please check with your friends who has a moto phone before buying - on the quality and service(of course poor quality u simply walk in to one of their service center to see the long queue and the hassle)

 Its fast
 Does not hang
 Vice performance
 An handle multiple things easily
 But worst part - Its OS is least user friendly
 To access system holders u have to install apes from PlayStore.
 Its a big security hazards
 Case u have used Samsung phone then dont go for Moto - all find the OS very tough and least customisations.

 I Purchased this product on January2015 and after 4 months battery is draining very fast
 i had visited service center in Marthahalli, Bangalore 2 times and they said its software issue and formatted the device still I am facing the same issue They are not ready to replace battery even my warranty is not over
 Again and again they reform the device and given back to me
 Also I have excavated issue to Motorola chat support and I got call from them and they had taken remote session of my phone and they said there is no problem in settings of the device

 1 os RAM is equivalent to 512MB.
 Not recommended for the users who want to multitasking.
 Not of laws while playing games and opening
 Also the camera quality touch is not that great
 There are lot of other option available like Us Zenphone 5 , Samsung Grand Crime which are being used in my family and are giving much better performance

 However the phone stopped working on with June and I called the customer care on with June
 They asked me to take it to the service center as no exchange was allowed
 Please Please Please os NOT BUY THIS PHONE.. SAVE MONEY AND SAVE TIME

 Product is Awesome.
 To sons for this device except Battery
 Because the battery is 2070mAH, drains quickly
 Not that bad when compared to the ASUS mobile
 ASUS battery back is pathetic
 Except battery backup, Everything is Awesome in this device
 Oats off to the Designers.
 Thank you Flipkart for same day delivery

 I had been keeping track of this phone for about 2 months before buying it
 its a very comfortable as well as good looking model
 The size isn too big as some people may feel
 It fits comfortably in my palm Who knows I have big hands
 The touch is responsive and even though the 1 os RAM seems less it supports all apes and doesn lag Os dont play too many games
 The camera is excellent though some heating problems are there on prolonged usage but that is to be expected
 The dual sterno speakers were a surprise
 I expected one to be a speaker and another the receiver
 wont expect the speakers to play os Audio.
 whereas some static heard when the speaker mode is ON.
 The biggest drawback is the phone facility (IRONY).
 The loudspeaker and hands modes have almost same volume when full
 Whether you need a phone for a short time before upbraiding to a flagship model or your buying it as someone first mid-range phone this is the best choice
 It Os 10,999, it is the best option among its peers
 I use it and him happy

 The product is reasonable stylish and moreover with all best features in it.Also it was such prompt service

 good worth for money but bad camera really good to use liked the hands look feel and overall aspects
 The Sterno speakers Camera and additional storage are the biggest upgrade over the previous honest
 The only con in this phone is the very average battery life
 Of one is a regular user of the phone for browsing whatsapp, etc several times a day I feel the battery will drain out in about 8-10 hours

 Worst andros phone i have ever seen.Absolutely sensitive screen but gets broken easily comparing to other touch screens.Poor battery backup.Those who prefer Moto G and generation should carry their battery back with them.Gets hanging frequently while using internet.Whenever we start use this hands it gets heat.Among all very costly to service the phone when the screen gets broken

 I brought this phone from flipkart 2 days ago it is good sound quality is nice picture is also better but not so good as samson phones,and i get the lollipop version 5.0.1.
 The andros is regretful
 no music player,no audit recorder,even no file manager
 An you imagine Motorola helping said me that I have to install file manager from the playstore to install apes further??? Pain problem is that you even canst install Any big games like Weird Dark os Layman Jungle Run etc.The All quality is also very poor
 Os I will suggest you to go for an another phone like "samsung s neo in this range of 10 to 12k.just listen to me for your welfare and buy another

 First of all Flipkart's delivery was awesome.
 It was delivered 4 days before expected time
 Packaging was also good
 Now for the Moto go its a very good phone
 Very very fast
 Though battery life a bit short.But takes very less time to charge.It comes with a lolipop andros v5.0.2. which upgrade time to time
 Overall the speck are good to run the phone smoothly

 nice phone with very good features battery back is very nice since this is my first smart phone i am enjoying it sound quality is also good the only thing that troubles me is that it does not has an built file manager so you have to download an pp called es file explorer in the playstore you can not set your own custom ring tone so i did it using the smile explorer and there is no reminder feature in it or note pad facility and you can even keep different lock screen and different home screen pictures i faced only these problems all games work nice and all apes also work properly nice phone within its price HAPPY to own a MOTO os

 It seems that Motorola is dumping off a bad batch of Moto G Bones as most of the People who are using this Shone i know are facing similar issue with the Battery
 When i approached the Service Enter i was informed that they already have such Bones with them in abundance and that the Battery cannot be replaced without an approval Os dont know from whom
 There isn any definite answer as to if you would get the Product replaced or that the Battery gets replaced
 Kindly opt for another Mobile and save yourself the Hassle.
 10,999 down the drain

 Dear Flipkart team Thanks for such a royal treatment
 I have been one of the fan and loyal customer of flip-kart till this mail
 But the loyalty is broken this time
 I will never buy a single product from flipkart neither i will recommend you guns to any of my friend
 Met me tell you this amorous story to you
 I order Moto G and Men my Order In exchange offer I was happy for the amount that I was getting for my old phone so I decided to go for it
 I was eligible for two offers os Exchange offer os HDFC bank card os off I booked the order delivery was schedule for with June
 Now the problem starts here os I didn got name and no of a person who was going to deliver the products
 Flipkart always use to send the name and no of person who will be delivering the products
 os Delivery boy gave me call right from my door steps and asked me for my old mobile which was with me and i was at office it was around 4:00 (Approx time i asked him to deliver at 6:30. he said he can deliver again and suggested me to collect it from the Andheri Sub at On Udyog.
 and also mentioned it is open 24*7 os I went to hut at 7:15PM and there I came to know the order has been RTO, customer care has canceled my order without consulting me
 os When there was a blame game os said it has been canceled from Logistic side and logistic team said it has been canceled by CS, and also said delivery vendor is new they may not be aware of process
 I am aware if I schedules the delivery for 3 time then the order gets RTO.
 His is ridiculous and not accepted at all
 I have formatted my old phone now have to do all work on it
 Now can you guns cancel the order without consulting me
 Even after showing my readiness to go to hut for collecting my order by myself
 this is mental harassment.
 And now i have to burn my blood at your customer care not
 Hope you guns take corrective measure for it

UPDATE os os 15/07/2015 After 1 & half months use The phone fell from my hands 3 times and nothing happened...
 The screen did not brake even falling from a height of 5 feets... people who say that screen broke from the height of 2 feet are those who might have thrown their phone out of anger and the result was screen broken By experience says "Yes, there is a good quality of morning gorilla glass 3:.... so guns go for it... best phone...

 I have got a product with defects or issues
 His Mobile has severe issue with the battery
 The battery back is pathetic
 I almost use the mobile putting it in for charging
 His mobile battery dies to os from 100% and shuts down often
 And on normal basis this mobile has only half day battery back up
 I am using this bloody device as landline... by putting it for charging most of the time
 I raised this concern with Flipkart just after 5 days of purchase
 But no help
 I am a regular buyer on flipkart.
 Still did not get support
 By request to look at the issue was rejected

 After the mitka updated the performance is much better as mitka is optimized for 512MB RAM honest
 Os 1GB is more than enough here
 Battery perform really well goes for 1.5-2 days on one full charge with nominal usage
 With heavy Os usage it goes for 1 day
 os All quality To issues

 Purchased a Moto Os hands from flipkart Order id:OD002895576077885700).
 The product delivered was defective and probably already used ( the hands came in with a matt finished screen guard already starting to wear off
 The battery drains within a few hours sometimes dropping from 100 to 20 percent within 30 minutes
 The flipkart Lech support team rejected the request for a replacement
 Have wasted weeks arguing with your customer support to no avail
 They still stubbornly maintain the hands has no problems
 Really disappointed in you guns

 The Moto G phone I had received gets heated up frequently
 Its battery life is very poor fully charged battery hardly last for 3-4 hours without using it for communication purposes
 To make the things worse Flipkart's customer service is really bad
 I had wasted a lot of time and energy in making them understand the problem and ask for a resolution
 I found them pretty unprofessional.
 Overall I had a very bad experience with the phone and with Flipkart.
 Will always refrain from buying stuff from Flipkart in future
 I think Flipkart should STOP using the rallying cry - B War Wish Dog Poori".

 I purchased this phone 5 months back
 One fine day my phone got wet in rain
 Since then the resolution of the screen has gone down and pink lining started appearing on the screen
 When I contracted Motorola customer service center they told since it is fluid damaged it is not covered under warranty and I will have to pay 4500 INR for the same
 Seriously!!!??
 For a phone worth 10K, I need to pay 4.5K for display
 I would rather buy some Chinese hands in the same price range with better functionality, performance and quality
 From specification perspective this phone seems really good but when it comes to the quality it is a cheap phone

 but they canceled the time what they mentioned on the message then they will fix at another time
 till yet I did not receive any calls from them regarding this issue
 Its clearly shows that they are cheater....

 The only cone with this device is its battery backup, it is good but not that great
 Overall the device is best choice in this price range

 In th June when i connected the charger to charge my phone there was a spark in the phone port for charging and then i was not able to charge the phone
 The phone was working fine but it was not getting charged
 A call to to the Motorola All Enter yielded a 9000 Os Quote for complete replacement of motherboard.

 Later after 20 days I found that the Dual speakers was sometime not working which was a begged concern for me

 I bought this phone almost 2-3 weeks back
 Reason for buying this phone was because my father and my wife had bought moto g st generation
 His moto g first generation worked perfectly well and giving amazing service since last 1.5 years
 battery life is amazing
 Hence me my sister and brother in law bought moto g and generation
 all these moto g and generation is work as far as battery life is concern
 the main reason for me to buy new phone was battery life
 which was amazing in moto g st generation
 but moto g and generation is worst for its battery life
 not just with my phone but all the moto g and generation phone we bought at my place
 i also inquired with few of my friends who bought moto g and generation
 every one had battery problems it takes 4 hours to charge the complete battery and it takes 3 hours to drain if you have g data ON.
 I strongly do not recommend any one to buy this phone
 applications response RAM and display is good Flipkart delivered it well with in time and good coordination

 To unwanted reloaded apply

 In simple words they need more RAM.
 To what should u do
 To for other honest
 NO.
 Other honest such as Mi4i, have a lot of software issues
 For example MIUI (Xiaomi's OS) alone consumed 800 os RAM.
 And its not so fast either even with 2 go ram
 I mean seriously you dont want to shell out Os 13000 to go for a phone whose RAM management is so poor
 MIUI, for all its customisation, is a bug magnet and cause a lot of overhearing issues with a phone
 To every time there a breakup which is often company issues a statement saying they will release an updated
 In all the developing course its the user that suffers
 Seriously U dont want to risk or hard earned money and user experience on a smartphone whose quality is limited to regular updated (NOTE: regular update size is close to 800MB).
 In the contrary stock andros consumed just 450 os ram and its ram management is excellent and safer
 It is pure simple elegant and minimalist.
 You guns might be thinking that mine is a probably hate case against MIUI or Xiaomi.
 In reality its on the contrary
 The reason ism only talking about MIUI is because its still the best of custom UI's, others are far worse
 Anyways, its time for good news
 Moto G 2015, eyes u heard what u saw the rd generation of Motorola's most loved smartphone is surely coming by the end of july probably earlier
 its going to be the most awesome phone in the budget
 It will boast stock android, faster processor 1080p screen resolution 2GB RAM, 8 and 16 figs internal memory models and will retain one deal maker that missing on mimi Expandable Memory Clot unto 32 or 64 gigs).
 You might think that these are rumours
 But its logical isn it
 Otherwise how do u expect motorola to survive in a world where 2 figs RAM is quickly becoming the norm
 You can also goose it to confirm that its coming
 Lastly it wont be fitting if i dont express my gratitude to this amazing device
 I bought the device in february 2015.
 its best on quality user experience is the most excellent things
 Hardware is impressive
 Designed to hold comfortably in hands
 It does not last
 Battery back lasts for a full working day not more
 Any of you might be thinking that him not a power user or I dont play games Well were right
 But that what u expect from a phone this range
 I wont claim its a flagship by any means
 its a mid range device but a perfect mid rangers
 The reason have reviewed this device so late is because I wanted to gift a inch smartphone to my mother on her birthday which is in june
 To I saw a hell lot of reviews of smartphones under rs.15000 like Us Zenfone os Zenfone os Mi4i, Semi os MeiZu mi note U Yuphoria, Yureka, Novo a6000 plus on a hell lot of you tube channels like GeekyRanjit, C4ETech, Bailey Tiens Intellect Digest Android Authority Techniqued, u name it
 In the process I wasted almost 3 days watching video reviews tying constantly before settling for Mi4i.
 But its overhearing issues and its dependence on large updated for quality coupled with unexpendable 16gb storage out of which u hardly get 10gigs) constantly flogged my mind
 When suddenly I saw my moto g (2014), and thought why not this
 I nearly ordered it just noticing seconds before that most of the phone were shipping with 2 figs even when they were prices lower
 I thought probably that was because of custom UI's which is partially true but I also found out that apes were starting to use more RAM than every To I backed out
 Though my moto g still provides me with 450mb free ram which is just enough but when u think of a year later in 2016, go becomes pointless.
 A budget buyer usually busy a phone that can serve him best value for at least 1.5 years
 And dont forget a 2 year old processor
 To DEFINITELY NOT.
 Again guns I know its long but it would rather spare u the 4 day headache in my cases I had a very fast internet 30gb plan and did all this on a laptop.
 For mobile users it can take forever
 To him not at all sorry for the length
 I count have described it any lesser and better
 Open It would help most of u guns

 I bought it around 10 months back and after using this for this long I can say that this mobile is the best available product at this price range
 Fact no other mobile is near this much
 Google always provides the latest available andros version worst this products

 5/5 for the delivery time by the Flipkart.
 I got the first and every replacement within 1 day
 but 1/5 for the QUALITY of product delivered
 Requested for the replacement 2 times and even then the product delivered was low on quality
 The quality does seems to be related with the reduced prices of the particular model
 Very time I received this products there was a problem with the display
 1.
 There was white light spread was if a white bulb is present at bottom left and right of the screen display
 His light spread was not visible under day light or normal conditions
 but was clearly visible in dark with full brightness level and placing a black wallpaper.
 2. The second piece I received as a replacement had another display problems
 His time there was blue spot just below the centre of the screen which was clearly visible with a white background
 Not only that if a screen was touched anywhere on the lower half the same blue spot shows some kind of depression and looks as if some liquid is flowing down the screen
 More disappointing was that I was told by the technical team to download third party pp from the PlayStore to check if it resolves the issue and the pp when download was showing an ad Your phone has a virus click to scant os I means firstly how a hardware problem could be fixed with a software secondly that too by a third party pp which promotes risky aware and lastly what if I do not have access to internet then how could someone download that pp 3. The third piece delivered again had some quality issues where the display shows the grid lines of the LCD panel on tilting the phone even with the slightest angle
 but it seems have to accept the mistake of buying it first place and hence not reporting it again
 Also the process of replacement is not very convenient
 I had to contact the customer support team first which schedules a call with the technical team on a specified date and time that means I had to bear with the issue till then
 And to explain the real issue is another big challenge because it is very easy to see or observe the issue but very hard and difficult to explain it in words
 my suggestion PLEASE os NOT BUY this product anymore

 I bought this phone on th Run 2015.
 I open the box start installing the OS and software it was working fine
 th Run Morning phone was totally dead I though it is because of battery
 I put this on charge for 1 hours
 Still this phone is dead
 I lodge a complaint to flipkart customer care
 But their response was very bad
 They told me as per company policy minimum 24 hour they will take to give me a call to understand the problems
 Very ridiculous
 I lost my trust on flipkart online shopping

 Great with one small issues
 I dont like the volume workers & the power button on the phone
 They dont feel long lasting at all
 Must hope they do last
 And also hoped that the original accessories were a bit reasonable

Shrivallabh Sa...
 First of all and like to clarify
 By review is not of the product per see but the delivery experience
 I never received the products and thought it worthwhile to make you aware of the terrible service
 By first gen phone broke down after 1.5 years of usage due to hardware issues and I went in for this device
 I ordered it with 24-hour guarantee as I needed it on a priority basis as my work was getting delayed without a smartphone.
 And the phone reached my nearest hut overnight according to their cracking platform
 But until three days they just kept giving excuses that they couldn reach me etc and kept dating with But for delivery at 10 am and Failed to deliver due to operational issues at 3 pmb
 He contracted customer care gave alternate number still the same tomfoolery going on
 Finally they gave up and refused the amount
 They had the audacity to postpone delivery further
 Met me tell you their van comes to my camps almost daily with parcels as there are many who order
 And when him not around they leave it with the garden
 And this has happened countless times
 Probably him guessing they never had the phone in stock and were just footing around
 To be wary
 By rating is also based on delivery experience and not the product itself

 I was already a fan of MOTO G since last years the only reason for not picking was lack of expandable memory
 With this and Generation Launch I must say Motorola has launched a monster which would eat away the charm of ANY other phone
 With 5 inches display it looks really classy.. Looks better than any phone I see around os Camera is awesome even for dim lights good battery very smooth in operation due to go RAM and quand core processor excellent graphics and above all extremely sleek and handy
 There are already huge praises all over the webster I would just mention one things pp please open your eyes and buy a phone which values your money
 I dont understand why they have a doubt and say its Motorola I am looking for something in Samsung!! Please!! Same configuration in Samsung would cost you just double and all Samsung phone look alike and moreover FYI - Motorola is the oldest company to launch mobile
 Motorola Lowered by Google is the BEST combination daytime with unbelievable prices
 I was not expecting and gen to be this low at prices
 Oats off Also Of you have been delivered a defeated piece you can get it replaced instead of talking ill over websites.. even Peri Os was replaced by me 2 months back that doesn mean its a bad phone
 Its just an electronic device there are chances of manufacturing faults check properly when you get use it extensively for a weeks analyze it and get it replaced Must close your eyes and buy it you will love it

 I am using this oh from past 6 months
 Touch is good as per price tags
 Not as good as of apple I3.
 performance is good in different application and in different games
 Battery is for 1 day in which I play candy crush for 15-20 min a day 8-10 calls and somewhat whatsapp.
 so battery life is not so good Power saving mode is a good option when you less battery left in this the
 my rating is 3.5.

 I bought this Moto G on recommendation from friends
 While Os sure the phone is good when bought from an authentic vendor the unit that came through Flipkart was corrupted did not even have Google Lay Tore on it
 this is a software the vendor/manufacturer needs to preinstall and cannot be done by any other user
 Also I realised this unit had this piece missing quite late as him new to Android processors and was unable to do this online

 from my side the star will be zero but there is no option for zero so star will be one

 Well thought that i m going to have a good phone..But after a few days it sucks....not only the performance even the battery back also suddenly dropped..but the only plus point is its camera and its sound built...... i was even provided an extra default feature,i.e.,even if i double tap the screen it gets enlarged . . .
 thus it is not so good phone according to me

 Not the phone on May 26.. Round it defective and raised return request immediately....
 They told that I will be receiving call from technical support on the next day evening so that they can troubleshoot the problems
 Also asked to install 'Flipkart SmartChk App'....
 But everyday I use to wait for the call which had never come...
 I call to the FLIPKART CUSTOMER CARE 2-3 times daily for connecting to THIS Technical team...But these people always have only one reply ::::: "Sir, U will be getting the call tomorrow 3:30 PM"....ANNOYED LIKE ANYTHING, hearing this reply daily!!!!! STILL I am carrying the defective box with me.... Haven't experienced such a bad service from any customer care!!!!!
 In tonight call they told that my request has expired and so i will have to raise a new request!!! NOW WAITING FOR THEIR CALL, WHICH THEY TOLD, I WILL os RECIEVING TOMORROW NOON!!!!!
 I think such negligence should be brought to CONSUMER COURT.!!!!!

 I have been using this product since 2 months that too after replacement of the first piece as it started heating on using Os which shouldn have happened at all.The replacement was also not fast on flipkart's part which again was not expected from flipkart.
 Now about phone it still heat up but lesser than earlier ones heavy,camera is average and those who want specially a camera phone dont buy it and the spaekers,they are excellent for hearing a song but when u call or someone calls u the voice go out and u constantly need to lower the volume but....the good thing is and only good thing is for which u can buy it that it doesn hang and the andros is very fast..........so choose wisely

 After reading a lot of reviews and watching undoing video I bought this phone
 To I had a fair idea what to expect
 But it want what I expected
 First I received the phone in Moto G branded box without any plastic escaping it
 To it seemed to be that I have been delivered an unpacked products
 Second the box contained only the phone
 By only phone I mean only phone and couple of manuals).
 The charger and earphone were included separately outside the Moto G box
 Third the charger is not branded by Motorola and it does not have any USB cable
 The earphones are Motorola branded but are probably the worst quality earphones in terms of materials used not sound wise I have ever seen
 In undoing video of Moto G I could see that the charger and earphones were included in the Moto G box itself but this want the case with me
 His arouses a lot of suspicion in my mind â€“ has Flipkart created me out with this products
 In Flipkartâ€™s defense the actual Moto G phone is working pretty well and I couldn find any signs that I was delivered an unpacked products
 But the branded charger and low quality phone makes me wonder if Flipkart is taking its customers for a ride
