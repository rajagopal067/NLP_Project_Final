 The silence functionality under the Avoid Interruptions' doesn work
 I think this is a serious flaw since being able to silence the phone is a very basic feature even in old-fashioned honest
 A query related to accessories - how come you dont have a back grip cover for this phone

 Guaranteed to get the latest version of Android OS everytime when a new update is available
 Guns Sure Android without any unnecessary mode and boats done by other manufacturers like Samsung, Sonya HTC, etc Oz of this Moto G and Os receives updated directly from Google, like the Nexus Android One and Google Lay Edition series of honest
 Os Moto Os G2, E and X are focused on India and other rd world countries it gives better Value for Money for Indian buyers compared to other non-Indian phone manufacturers

 Awesome delivery by lip part
 Moto go is awesome in all aspects but while booming picture quality is not good this is the only sons which I could notice Those who have a budget of 10000 - 16000 go ahead and buy moto either spend extra unto 3000 or save unto 3000.

 I received this phone from Flipkart within 3 days and that indeed is a delight
 About the phone arguably the best in its class and the pricking is very good
 It is extremely easy to use and integrated Google, that makes life easy
 By usage is limited to phone email and a couple of basic apes like LinkedIn, Facebook, twitter etc and they work flawlessly.
 Regarding charge it would've been better had they also given the USB charger in addition to the electric one
 Other than this no complaints at all

 The product is comparable good when compared to branded products available at this prices
 The product would've been GREAT & AWESOME (would've been everything anyone ever needed in a smartphone) if the following could be upgrade
 Primary camera 10 os or above instead of 8MP all
 Secondary camera 5 os instead of 2 os all
 >RAM....1.5
 or above instead of 1 all
 >Expandable memory...64GB instead of 32 os all
 >Battery.....min.
 2500 or above.....currently its low

 Us just beware of my experience i faced
 I have booked this Moto g with 10 % discount of SBI.
 After one week they them self canceled the order and initiated my fund back with any intimation
 After that they have sent an email saying unable to deliver the product to my pin code mentioned
 Sorry for inconvenience
 But why did they accepted order before Lesson : wont believe this Indian Flipkart totally

 Ordered Moto G must Men in August but faced endless problems so returned it and finally took and Men
 After using 30 days i concluded Sinus 1. Battery (Yes, all that u have heard about battery is absolutely correct Have to charge it minimum 2 times a day
 Hoping that ANDROID L solved the issue to a bearable extent
 2. Accessories are prices as if they have included an element of gold in them
 3.
 Of u use a high ended pp for 20 minutes and return to screen it freeze for 5 sect
 4. Screen was much better in former model
 5. 80% of your RAM is consumed in default operations Flush 1. Ultimate Android experience for 13000 bucks believe me goose services like map etc cannot be enjoyed better in any other phone of this category 2. Two miss solved the call quality issues 3. Cam has been practically improved
 4. Screen size and icons looks way better than former model
 5. os Hard speakers etc are all good as specified in earlier reviews
 To all in all have a power bank and welcome to a whole new world of andros

 Not the phone from Flipkart.
 While the phone was good for a few days it went dead one fine day
 The phone is not working at all and the Motorola customer care asked to get it replaced by Flipkart.
 While there are no guarantees with electronics these days but a lot of my friends have had issues with Motorola phone bought on flipkart.
 Probably the os team at motorola India is not doing thorough checks on the phone and the service centre folks sound like lame ducks have no experience in hardware/software or a clue of what the problem is
 Hopefully flipkart solved the problem soon

 After using both first generation and second gen Moto Os i am writing this review
 Round quality Moto G first genu
 has better sound quality than second genu
 both speakers are in front but for calling purpose sound in second genu is louder than first gen .
 Camera quality : Moto G and genu beats the first gen by a good margins
 Fixed density in Moto G must gen)-324ppi and in and gen... 294 pp but it doesn make any difference
 Design Both are well designed but st gen is easy to grip and has better back finish
 Volume and lock keys in second gen is not so comfortable to use as in st genu
 Battery Moto G must genu has enough battery capacity according to its screen size but second generation is not unto mark @2070mah... it should have 2500 may atleast.
 Touch and gen has smooth touch experience as compared to st genu
 Overall both are good at their price point and its unto u that you want to use a 4.5 inch screen or 5 inch

 os FIRST REVIEW ....
 I never have stopped through flipkart, but as i want this phone i ordered MOTO G and genu
 through flipkart.
 It was delivered on the th day
 Packing was good and product was seal packed very well
 Motorola G and is a great phone i realized after seeing the phone nice build and beautifully finished
 It has 2 speakers one at the level of hearing as usual and other is at microphone level(which creates dual stereo).
 after using it for a day i can strongly recommend this over zenfone5, mid .
 battery last for a day on continuous usage which i suppose is good
 overall an awesome phone !!!

 I am writing this review after using this hands for 1.5 months
 st of all buds to Flipkart for their fast service and seriously some ultra tight packing
 Now coming to the hands from Motorola.
 The hands looks amazing with its 5 inch screen and dual front speakers drilled
 The rear finish looks good with the 8MP Same Clash and Moto Logo(with a slight dip that feels good on touch and feel
 Feels good a had heavy when held
 Build quality is good and sturdy
 Under the hood
 Well I would say I am actually a bit disappointed with the speck provided
 RAM configuration Processor and Graphics all are the same as the st Men handset.
 They should have been upgrade a bit
 The screen size has been increased and it does consumed the battery a bit more
 His is till now the biggest disappointment in this handset.
 I dont have any games nor heavy apply
 I use watsapp and tomato apply
 Without doing anything extra and lowest level of brightness playing no games(strictly), gas settings switched off always battery back up is mere 1.5days.
 Think if you have much more apes and games it will drain down the battery within less than half a day
 You can watch few video in couture and check the battery level
 Performance There are last yes
 i have been facing lagging issues
 It takes time to switch from apes to main screen or even a worst experience I would say is it hanged few times and the phone system frozen
 I had to start the device
 A big improvement needs in this section if Moto wants to go ahead with this series
 Round quality is good in the speakers if you have a good headset/headphone, it does pretty good
 Default Moto headsets provided are waste
 Display is crisp and clear
 Touch is responsive but again sometimes lagging interferes
 Dear and Front CAM quality is pretty nice
 Tic editing option are nice
 You can also download Google Cam pp for better enhancements.
 All quality is good
 Will now I didn found any call drops
 To extra bloatware.
 Some good apes are pre-installed from Motorola that are helpful
 Build 4/5 Same 3.5/5 Performance 3/5 Even though lagging issues are there Battery backup: 2.5/5 Should have been increased to least 2500 may from 2070) Round 4/5 Display 3.5/5 All quality 3.5/5 UI response 3/5 NB: I am not comparing this handset(except Moto G st Men with any other company made handset.
 You will get phone act to your budget

 first of all a good job done by flipkart for delivering the phone so early

 Of you want to buy this phone go for it but if u have a doubt have a look on the asks zenfone once
 I hope this review helps

 Splendid delivery
 I got it within 2 days of ordering
 Oh did I say 2 days
 I meant 2 weeks
 Two
 Frikking.
 Weeks
 One good thing I learned out of the countless messages I sent to Flipkart asking them what order status was that these folks respond FAST.
 him not saying the responses are particularly helpful its just good knowing that these people do give some damn
 In to the product review Honestly the only problem I found with the device was the fact that the ratification light ONLY GLOWS in one color white
 His is not something that can be fixed by software modifications(sorry, rooters).
 Camera quality is sweet Well at least in well lighted conditions
 Front camera is also decent enough to show all the ugly pimples in your face
 Again in well lighted conditions
 The stock launched is clean and fast
 whereas a catch thought
 You canst add any new pages in the homescreen.
 To bigger
 Battery life is average-ish.
 I know a lot of people are complaining about the display and the pp and all... but its really not that bad
 him not really a techno-enthusiast, i dont spend a whole lot of time comparing different phone and all so maybe its just me
 But I really love the display
 Keyboard
 Keyboard has a noticeable lag sometimes while using certain applications
 It does disappear after some time so that newly
 The body is elegant
 I means him holding this big-a** phone in my hand and him telling myself I canst believe I bought it just for 13000 INR.
 To final verdict
 Of your budget allows it buy it

Anil Kumar Singh
 His hands is the same as Moto G st genu except for a marginal bigger screen and front sterno speakers
 And of course a little better camera
 I got this so that I can receive latest Android updated for a pure Android experience
 Or else could have gone for other cheaper and perhaps better phone like Xiaomi Semi Os or even Huawei Folly
 But then they have customised Android and restricted updated
 1GB RAM instead of 1GB would have added a little more value to this handset.
 It doesn laws or hangs but almost 80-85% of RAM is always consumed in running apes and system files in the background
 Battery life hasn impressed me much
 Its just an average one
 But a os os phone actually
 I am quite happy thought
 Os if you are looking for the purest andros experience and guaranteed future updated then go for it

Vineet Ranjan
 Hello All First of all Thanks to Flipkart for delivering so quick.Second, regarding the product fault dont just blame Flipkart as even they dont know what inside the box.This is my fourth hands buying with Flipkart and the very first time was disappointed with the delivery after using it , firstly with the brand and secondly with Flipkart as anyone would be for delivering such piece and thinking why me fond the product in faulty stage as one him slot was not working but still Flipkart replaced the product with a brand new box pack,still after using 25 days so thanks once again.When Flipkart says 30 days replacement guarantee they do
 I bought this product after doing extensive research and comparison between several bands online
 Now about the product review am using the product now from almost past 1 month and the review is based upon that
 PRO'S: OS : Mitka latest version Display : HD.Delivered what they said
 Screen : Gorilla Glass.I used almost 15 days without any screen-guard but still couldn find any scratch on the screen but It doesn mean MOTO G doesn need screen guards
 iii : Signal Strength is too good was still able to connect to my wife outer when other devices failed to connect at that range
 Design : Feels good in hand
 Camera : Does what it says.Takes quality pictures Speed I didn had issue till now opening 5-6 apes at the same time regardless of apes or games or anything
 Network : Though its a dual him phone till now no issues with the network or call dropping
 SIM Election : You have an option for calling from one him and sending messages and using data network from other sim.Even you have option for ask evrytime.But keep in mind that when you use one him while talking or calling your other him becomes unteachable
 Battery It gives better performance even i use it with full performance.But still u need to charge it after heavy use of 6-7 his of callings,gamings and all other stuffs.If you use it only for calling 10-12 his
 you will get at least with some percentage left
 Round Quality : Good whether its in call or listening songs(though dual speakers but you will not find much difference Moto Assist : behaves as you behave.if
 you are in meetings set it and will not get disturbance...if you are sleeping set it will not disturb your sleep and other option
 CON'S Headphone : Included headphone doesn provide what expected.Sounds are low and you barely hear or listen anything except if luckily you are alone.When i use my other headphones like samson tabes it sounds great.But you canst expect much at this price range
 Features : Of you are used to of Samsung user or any other bands you will find it with less features.It will take some time to used to all features of MOTO G and sometimes you might feel it was so easy to find in other devices.It doesn mean it make it lesser than any other brandy
 Battery : Sometimes it might disappoint you when you are really in need.So better keep charger with you all the time as back and also try not to use so much of apes and features which are not needed
 Him Clots : Micro Sims.If you dont have micro him before buying or placing order please arrange it before.Or else you might have to cut you aims or have to use him adapted which are not much of helpful
 His review is based upon 28 days of using using now.If i will come to know anything which are needed to tell will surely update.But till now not all but almost Motorola has delivered what they are saying.Till then if anyone who is looking for any smartphone at this price range i would really recommend it to anyone

 its my fourth moto g in family and the first and generation moto g took
 no flaws as usual so same review as my previous one
 but one suggestion for moto makers in their next launch they should increase pp density as the screen has gone bigger and intact thebbattery took
 as my moto g first gen is more brighter than moto g second genu the battery obviously will also be used up with large screen so next time more boasted juice
 leave reviews buy it to experience nd u will know why this beast is still much better than many of organ loops
 at last about flipkart delivery...these people surprise everytime as it was to be delivered by November th it i talked on with october before ordering the its for my wife on birthday so i want on or before with october...they just said...sir u just order nd leave rest with us...i received it on must october on dhanteras...rather than supporting some foreign webster i support indian company and they deserve it....

 all the features are very good and useful except battery back-up.
 if your heavy use if net then you need to charge battery 3 times in day is only a drawback
 other wise phone is awesome.

 I purchased and replaced this product 3 times from flipkart.
 Were are the issues First time Micro SIM slot not working Second time Camera issue
 Third time Both the SIM card shots are not working By recommendation I am not sure this is the issue with Motorola Moto G and gen phone itself or is this issue with os retailer who is sending defective product to flipkart.
 It is always suggested to purchase phone from the shop rather than online

 First of all Thanks a ton to flipkart for a lightning fast delivery.Very much satisfied with the delivery and ease of track of my products
 About the MOTO Os , I was previously using HTC ONE which was for 34K and had mind blowing features
 His time my budget was low and i was looking for the same feature as HTC one .
 I ordered this phone i was quite nervous but after using MOTO Os i can find any difference between these 2. MOTO Os is such a power packed phone for such a low price .
 Spending every single penny on MOTO Os is worth
 Some people are afraid of the back cover thing , but let me tell you it is very unable just because it looks flexible doesn mean its cheap plastic.If outing for any other phone at this price range is waste
 By verdict is to go for MoTO G2.
 Thank you MOTOROLA & FLIPKART os

 I have used moto g must genu for 8 months impressed by its performance ordered Os on must OCT as a deal offer
 from word onwards got messages saying you product will be delivered by 7 PM.
 But the delivery guy never show up
 Have called flipkart on with informing about the issue but they asked to wait until 28 the last day of delivery
 But now (29/10/14) the ordered have been canceled
 The whole process SUCKS as e-kart and flipkart are making face offers and never care to deliver
 Once flirt was good but nowadays its service has been pathetic and customer service guns are so arrogant and irresponsible they did not even care to track what went wrong
 I have desperately talked for 15 mind with one of their executive but she did not even had the idea what needs to be done
 I am frustrated with FLIPKART guns
 In current competitive market you choose to stand with ethical and irresponsible behavior which will cost you heavily

 After a couple of replacement got a phone that works better
 By phone battery lasts hardly 15-16 hours and takes half a day to charge that too with location and bluetooth off
 The worst part of this phone is very slow charger & less battery life
 Otherwise it was a very good phone as far as speed and features goes
 its bad that Motorola has come up with an practical combination

 By Moto G and genu is heating too much during normal operations like talking listing songs and using camera etc
 I have received it on October 22 and started using it from October 27, 2014 and facing this heating issue from day first
 I have observed the same behavior in safe mode also
 Temperature is touching 42°C.
 The upper back portion and the upper front portion of the screen got very hot after normal uses
 It is not possible to take calls immediately after using the camera as it is not possible to keep it near ears
 Signal strength including the iii signals are excellent
 There is no os cards
 Observed the same behavior in safe mode also
 I have updated the phone and reported this to Flipkart and now waiting for their response
 In November 03, 2014 i have received the replacement against my problematical Moto G2.
 But the same issues are there in new piece of Moto G2.
 Its heating too much (44 °C) in normal operations
 Now i think its an manufacturing defect because my friends are also facing the same issues in their newly received mobile
 Now this time i have requested Flipkart to return my whole money back and waiting for their response
 In November 07, Filpkart team has accepted my request and got agreed to return my whole paid amount back to my account
 Os i have already done all the required R&D on this products hence they have not asked me to perform the same again
 They have collected the faulty device and will return the amount with in next 7 business days
 Were I like to appreciate the kind of support i have received form team Flipkart.
 They are having a great customer support team

 Sons 1. PHONE HEATS os for everything if used for more than 10 mind while using any pp for more than 10 mind - while using camera while taking any call downloading etc 2. Worst heating problem is while talking
 Your ears will start burning 3. EAR SPEAKER DISTORTION - Its of worst quality - Always distortion and irritating noise while having phone call 4. Taking long hours to gets charged up 5. Battery back is not that good I replaced my first piece stating above problems
 By new replaced piece too has the same problems
 Its CONS are more than it PROS.
 MOTO Os was great compared to G2.

 Amazing Shone and it is worth every Os one pays
 I migrated from a Black Merry and so this is my first experience with an Android phone
 The set-up was quick and comprehensive done is less than 15 minutes including most critical parameter
 The Camera is good and at 8 Megapixels is handy when you are on the go and dont have your regular Camera.The Battery is good and in the past few days done some extensive usage Music Camera During etc and on a full charge holds itself through the day
 The phone feels good in your hand right size
 Compared to shone 4 that my wife has this is certainly better
 Strongly recommend this phone since it is " Value for Money "

 Buying a Micromax, Karbonn, Spice Color etc is like investing in a share in stock market
 Some are good some are not some go up some go down everything is a risk and full of surprise some good some bad
 Buying this Moto G is like investing in a Fixed Deposit
 To special profits / bonus / features
 But no negative surprise either
 You will get what is promised a sturdy reliable handset.
 Some things I noticed after using it for over 1 months .
 Battery does take a longer time to charge .
 Genu buttons are on screen so you will effectively get 4.7 to 4.8 inches of unable screen space unless the application goes fullscreen egg
 images video games .
 Although the online reviews say the phone does not last they say it after using it for 2-3 days
 It does lag a little bit after I have installed some applications
 But then I think most phone will lag after you have installed some applications .
 os BLOATWARE (Hello, 'Micromad', sorry 'Micromax' are you listening???) .
 I think I believe in the policies / strategy / ideology of Motorola and hence I feel happy by using a Motorola phone which I dont think can be said about Micromax. .
 Motorola phone are well thought out and take user experience into account which Micromad, sorry again Micromax is trying so hard to ruin .
 After considering all the specification of the competing honest I think I ended up paying around Rs.1000 premium on this phone
 But I think its worth the satisfaction & peace of mind

 Well this is not my first smart phone but definitely a first in the 5 inch category or anything above 4 inch....and when i held the one in my hands today for the first time it felt great
 The interface is good specially after having seen Nexus 5 with my sister

AKSHAT KUMAR SINGH
 I am using this phone for a month now,found it a quite good one according to the price but the one thing i did not like is the battery life.The battery drains very fast and also sometimes when i clock the screen the touch does not works and then i have to lock the phone and then clock it again.So sometimes it feels annoying.Coming to the performance the phone is the best even better than higher prices phone .Look-wise the black one is better than the white one as one of my friend has the white one.The applications works very good.The camera is also quite good as pictures look good on the phone.The camera application is not good so you have to install a third party camera application and also a third party music application as the phone has only goose music player
 To summarizing A GOOD PHONE os THIS PRICE BUT NOT THE BEST ONE.
 He may find better speck phone cheaper than the MOTO G2.

 I Guys, The service through flipkart is good
 But the product is not the same as described in all The reviews from different sources
 I ordered Moto Os gen with lots of expectation as it was my st smart phone
 But dejected not once twice but thrice
 Yes I have to replace the mobile for 3 times where all the 3 with unique issue
 The st one had a deformity in screen where i couldn spot as the mobile comes with protective guard after a couple of days when i view it against the light i could spot it os .
 The and piece is where 3.5mm Back was very sensitive if i turn the earphone or any 3.5mm plug the music stops or pauses
 * While playing shalt 8 with medium graphics mode it just came out with a note the the pp has unfortunately stopped
 The rd and the final piece was something unique The I couldn add more than 2 alarm where the touch goes erratic or non responsive Was same issues as above with games
 any video more than 5 to 10 minutes the screen turns white and whole phone hangs where the video getting saved but cannot be played
 the the file not supported
 Flipkart was understood the issue thrice and have done their best
 where they gave me option of either replacement and refund of money
 Os a whole the phone fun is not up the specie
 defective pieces being regulated by os retailer But the flipkart is doing its best for keeping its customers
 I would recommend to buy any thing in flipkart but make sure its not from os retailer

 Flipkart did the very good job in replacement of Handset.
 One star is given due to Good Service from Flipkart and os Details
 To starts for Shone
 It was not expected to have such a bad product from Motorola.
 In first day it was not at all connecting Os when I inserted SIM.
 After about 24 hours It is not at all directing network in any of the SIM sloth
 And after factory rest setting It stopped connecting wife as well
 It laws on the basic functions of phone
 One more worst thing is battery is connected to the phone and can be removed separately
 Takes much more time than expected for charging and heat when you charge for more than hours

 I am a satisfied user of first gen moto G for the last six months
 The second gen of moto G also showed equal promise.Only, that probably my piece proved to be a lemon
 After two days the display started creating problems
 Some areas of the screen would not respond to touches wife hotspot would work at its whim
 Once the display was gone completely for a day
 I have asked for a replacement and awaiting it
 I can only hope that this time it will be a good one
 Of it is not faulty then the phone is excellent one just like its predecessor
 Leaving the screen resolution which has been reduced a little everything else is a little better than the first gen moto Os EDIT with october I received the replacement yesterday.By today it is also showing up with similar problems
 Some areas specially on the top portion of the screen would not respond to touches.Now I am not sure what to do should I go for a refund or ask for rd replacement
 Edit th Love I have decided to get refund
 I will try another phone probably nexus 5. By conclusion is that no phone is bad if you get the fine one
 In review of every phone I see some dissatisfied customers.One can only hope that the piece he gets will be a good one
 Hats why I have given the rating of 5 start in spite of having problems
 Because if those particular problems were not there it would be a wonderful phone

 Was looking for an Android phone and found this phone to be nearly perfect for my use
 I was looking for a phone that works for about a day without having to charge it and this phone with a mid-budget level perfectly suits my needs
 After having a bad experience earlier with flipkart on my earlier order this order was fulfilled perfectly well
 Even the courier (Delhivery- although has quite a lot of bad reviews on flipkart and google) seemed to deliver the package perfectly well and within the promised time frame
 The Shone The display is brilliant although it has a lower dip when compared to its previous generation
 The sound is good but not brilliant
 Doesn't really look like a huge inch phone and fits in the pocket really well
 Battery runs pretty well for a day inspire of slightly heavy usage and doesn get warm/hot.
 After 2 days of use I haven really found any bad features on the phone
 Will update if I find any

 Excellent phone at an unfordable prices
 Have been using it for 3 days only but here is my initial observation on the only con I saw so far Battery
 I felt it drains out pretty fast and may need 2 charges in a day for a moderate - high usage
 I used it to play games and brows internet on iii and felt it drained out pretty fast
 the of watching video on If ate up 30% of the battery
 him not sure if it is normal
 There was also little heating up of the hands but that is kind of excepted from all smartphones.

PHILEMON PHILIP
 1.The phone is well built
 2.Pure Android Experience makes it extremely fast and smooth(No Lag Or Frame drop
 3.Use of Samsung micro us charger is advisable
 4.The him slot is little bit hard to master put your him in and push all the way through till you hear a double click
 5.The screen is extremely well built
 6.Impressive touch response
 7.Network speed is excellent
 8.Able to open multiple apes 9.Able to operate with one hand
 10.The volume rocket key is a little bit hard to operate
 11.Headphone sounds not so premium but considering the phone budget it is acceptable
 12.Absence of NFC but seriously who needs one we can use wife direct
 In the whole I would like to conclude that it is the best smartphone when compared to other smartphones in this range and it will be updated to Android 5.0(guaranteed) and it is from goose what else on can ask for in this budget.So go for it and own a moto!!!

 Well "Delhivery" logistics should be probably renamed 'DEAD'ivery.
 Lowest and the most sordid logistics every
 had to personally collect the phone from their warehouse co they never seemed to respond nor delivered Flipkart better change their rd party logistics.
 Other than that the phone is really good Letter than what i had expected..had initial doubts whether to go for zenphone 5 or Moto G and Gen..
 After all the Research i went for this phone and now no doubt that this is the better Phone.. Overall Good Experience with Flipkart.. Disappointed with the Logistics..

 1. Battery is very good
 but It doesn last above 6 hours if you stay connected with 3G. 2. Display and camera quality are good with 8 os camera
 3. Touch is not sensitive
 Sometimes requires 2 or 3 touches to do an action 4. Mobile heat if continuously listening songs or playing games .
 Take Offers & Demands --------------------------------- I bought 2 nos Moto G and gen on very launch date th Rep 2014, 12.05 AM.
 The prices of covers and cases looks funny you declared the customers as fools
 I am provided with 50% off on cases & covers
 Will now I didn receive any sign of availing the offer
 Called plenty of times with customer care and sent plenty of email and got some irrelevant or improper response
 To you want the customers to wait more than 10 days and run behind you to avail the offer
 Plenty of fraudulent things under Terms and condition
 Saddest thing is it is not visible anywhere when you place the order
 I promise this would be my last order in flipkart.
 Of you guns keep on treat customers like idiot soon you will lose them

 The Moto G and Men is easily one of the best mid range mobile in the market at this moment
 It looks more than mid range
 Its sick and neat
 Though its a bit slippery it still costly fits in my palms
 The processor is quick and multi taking is good
 I also loved the display it has depth
 The display depth reminded me of Nexus 5.
 All in all a great phone at a highly competitive prices
 Super value

 Recently purchased
 Flipkart's online purchase experience is remarkable
 Quick response and cracking is very clearly explained step by steps
 Also get SMS alert for each stage of delivery
 While I lived in USA I used to order items from Amamzon.com and Walmart.com.
 I thought online purchase will not be possible in India but Flipkart is beyond my imagination related to service
 Only problem I could not find everything what I need online from India through Flipkart.
 Hopefully they may expand within the coming few years
 Regarding MOTO- G and Men it seems I got a very good phone for the prices
 For me 5 inch seems little big comparing to my phone 4 what I used
 I preferred a 4.5 in screen size because my palm is small
 I liked the features with specification of MOTO G and Men and therefore I ordered it
 I cannot give a perfect review at this time because it is too early to any things
 I will start using it all the time from next weeks
 I have to get a new Micro SIM from the BSNL.. Temporarily I am using a cut to size SIM which I dont prefer
 However based on the features I would like to recommend this phone for those who are looking a good mid-range ( below 15000/= ) smart phone
 I also purchased a Motorola lip cover for the phone
 It is very good fits perfect but the price is little high for a lip cover!!.

 North for the money.Everything has its own pro and cost
 All are good except Battery and data cable
 1.Battery charges very slowly.takes
 nearly 3 hours for full charge
 Battery drains quickly even if you are not using internet
 2.Don't expect Data cable with this mobile as the company is not providing the same with this phone
 Over all satisfied with the phone performance

 its a good phone and is way better than the same price equivalent of Bony and Samsung.......
 I haven used a zenfone 5 or mi3......
 But it is a decent phone.......
 To lags.....
 Even games like MC5, most wanted fifty and real racing 3 are performing without any lag......
 To heating issues.....
 The only trouble is that the phone battery drains real fast and also takes years to charge.... almost 3 hours from 0 to 100%) ......:-( Other than that its an awesome device.... :-)

 Not this phone yesterday and hence writing the review
 Really nice phone to use
 It is user friendly fast and doesn hang
 Rose os Display is really good
 os Touch quality is just awesome.
 os Speaker quality is much better than micromax and other samson honest
 os All quality is best
 os Camera is awesome.
 Pictures in dark background also look good
 os Video quality is above part
 Sons os Battery life is not what I expected
 It lasts for around 9-10 his with internet on music and gazing
 Need to install battery save it seems
 os They should have provided some more pre-installed apes like facebook, talk and older browsing
 Part from these 2 drawback this phone provides awesome user experience
 Would recommend it to those who are looking for a good phone in medium budget os

 i bought MOTO G(Gen2)mobile on big billion day with exchange of my old mobile
 i was facing NETWORK SIGNAL detection issue in both(sim1 and simon shots and i got the new one as replacement
 but second one also had the same problem in 1 him sloth
 Worst quality .
 Ensure all the functions are working fine when u receive the item least before replacement period

 His is my first experience with Online Purchase for Os over 1000/-.
 I was not sure and had doubts in mind even when I was ordering the Shone online
 To my surprise all my fears turned out be false
 In fact , it has been a very pleasant experience .
 I really congratulate guns at Flipkart for the excellent show
 You have really changed the perception of people like me who would still prefer walking to a store to purchase the Electronic Items
 The delivery was done just 3 days after the booking than the tentative date (Which, I believe was 10 days after the boolking).
 I believe you guns are more conservative on the delivery date.My advise is to make it more dynamic than a static one based on the purchase of the item
 Overall it is a wonderful experience and you would soon see me ordering more things on your site

 For this range this is probably a great deal
 There maybe other phone that are better in speck than this one but still to me this is a better deal - Rose 1.
 Stock Android, plus this has great chances of getting updated from Google. 2. Since no UI extensions are there if you like Android, you would love this took
 3. Vice feel of the phone
 Right in weight 4. Pretty good ease of use 5. Good sound quality Sons 1. Battery lasts a day - but I guess all smartphones do the same
 2. Its not full os

 A good phone from Motor
 Bandy and light weight that Moto G st generation,but if you are a hard core internet user battery back wont last for a day
 you need to purchase power bank additional to use the phone for a complete day

 I have purchased a Moto G and Men
 The service from Flipkart was excellent
 The phone is really fool .
 But the Product Quality is a big issue
 The Moto G which was delivered to me had some light showing through a minute gap on the panel
 Flipkart replaced this in two days and all is well with the replaced phone
 By niece also ordered the same phone
 The delivered phone had white patch on the display
 Now she has asked for a replacement
 I feel that Motorola is shipping phone with defects or they are recalling phone rejected by customers and sending them to new customers
 Which ever it is , Flipkart and Motorola needs to have a closer look at the quality of the phone being shipped

 Next day again I got a message for delivery but didn get my product till evening
 It end I myself went to the Delivery office and got the courier boy number and received my product on the way
 Vice product by the way

 Not the phone on Fig billion day Definitely one of the best phone esp in this budget PROS: 1.Camera Quality ---------------------------- Os read a lot of reviews stating the camera is just good but for my surprise it is one of the best 8MPs.. Even in Low-Light with Clash the noise is very lower #Photos are cunningly vivid and crispy.. Front cam also takes clean and bright images...good fr selfies.. #BUT the camera pp is very buggy
 Want focus properly
 Auto-Hdr doesn work well
 But its not the camera fault may be a software update or a different pp may fix them 2.Stereo Round Speaker ----------------- I have to elaborate on this part...What to expect and what not to Expect RICH sound with good bass when placed nearby like oft or 2ft.. idea when seeing a video or hearing songs when browsing... Touch Such better than usual MONO speakers you wont feel like hearing in a phone LS.. it as if from a mind portable speaker #BUT dont expect super loudness.
 When placed far away you wont find the sterno effect not the bass
 Goodness is surely above average but the quality degraded when we reach 75% of max volume
 To summarize Its awesome when placed nearby Vice when placed far Definitely a Loud phone 3.Call Quality -------------------- One of the LOUDEST phone i have ever used
 Seriously..
 Even in Noisiest streets I can hear crystal clear with my call volume set at just 60% or so... Also the voice clarity is rich..no static or call drops 4. Display --------------- Bright,Crispy, Beautiful
 I have not used many smartphones so I dont know in comparison with S4,Note,Z or whatever The display is very bright
 I drive in my bike using GPS and I never struggled even when the sun is super bright os good sunlight legibility.. Eyes it is using Moto os same display but 294 PPI is more more than enough no one is gone use a microscope i guessed The pick are super vivid and crisp guns
 The lesser the PPI the lesser load on CPU so the same battery on Moto G could handle the extra screen real-estate.
 5.Battery: --------------- I am not a Camera but I do browsing a lot
 With Os In for around 4-5hrs and 1-2 his of call and essaying and hearing songs in os the phone lasted me a day
 His is more than enough for me
 The charger is a bit slow
 6.Design --------------- Solid build quality
 To squeaky in the back panel
 Shone feels sturdy at the same time light on hands
 I was using a 3.7incher and was worried at getting a inch one as I have to use both hands
 All the worry flew away when I handled this device
 Right weight rubber back solid on hand can get better Yes.. sometimes I need both the hands esp when pulling the ratification panel or tying a web address in chrome... Google has to consider and design them so that key tasks are accessible from bottom right area itself
 I used Nova launched and set gestures for ratification panel and sorted out things... 7.Misc ------------------------- To heating issues on Os or in calls..No idea on gaming.A cool device
 There are few software stitches and bags which goose must fix..like.. Auto brightness is not well caliberated.. Auto-rotate creates a small pause when hearing songs as if it taxes the CPU... there are tiny laws occasionally even when less apes r installed Maybe Lollipo will fix all of them...
 He are one of the devices to taste Lollipop early who whooo...\m/ To overall a very good products Carefully designed Scores well in both looks and performance
 A definite multimedia device in this budget Highly recommended for those who expect Value for Money...

 I bought the phone on the big billion day
 Although the delivery was quick but the package was poorly crushed
 I had to go to the ECOM Express office to collect my delivery and there I saw how all the packages were manhandled and were being thrown away from here and there
 His was not at all what I had expected from Flipkart.
 They should really do something about it
 Os far as the phone is concerned it is a grm device and a bang for buck with the trust of a big brand like MOTOROLA.
 I have been using the product for like 3 weeks now and no issues so far
 But the phone
 To for it!!!

 I have purchased Moto G for the Known quality early this months
 I had problems like some white spots in the display
 I got the phone replaced within days from Flipkart for this problems
 But the second phone i am having problem with the phone ear piece there is lots of noise from the speaker
 I am totally dissatisfied with Moto G quality
 It is waste of my time to spend looking for Replacement from Flipkart.
 I didn expect such a poor quality products from Flipkart.

 I have purchased the phone 2 weeks ago
 Its giving problem with flash occurred 3-4 times in 2 weeks
 When I set flash to In mode and try capturing picture camera sometimes hangs and flash remains in In states
 When if I try reopening the Camera it asks me to Start the phone
 The flash doesn Off while restarting.
 It gets off when I open the Camera again after restarted
 Back panel is also too tight to open for the first time which then gets slightly loose later
 Anyway the other features are awesome.

 I am a Windows Shone user and got this for my Some
 His one is excellent value for money and recommend it to everyone who wants all the major features at an economic prices
 The only drawback is with the colour of headphones and the charge
 For a black piece I got a white headphone and white charge
 The quality of these accessories are very substandard too but for this prices small sacrifices are to be made
 All in all a great buy

 screen time is 4 hrs.. it should had least 2750mah battery
 it is upgradable unto andros 5.0 lollipop.
 in my phone the battery save is not working..it supports 1080p video

 First of all of I would say if you want to buy a phone with ask budget you should buy Moto G 2 genu
 The design of phone is attractive with curly shape
 The os display is also give smarter edge to this phone
 The speed internal memory pre installed apply moto alert pp are awesome.
 For this price the phone is excellent
 Os you know every coin has two faces and same is also applicable here
 1.
 There is no data cable in the box
 2. The charger plug pin are not as Indian standard and you will face loose fitting during charging
 3. The menu display of apes is disappointing idea if you reach to last menu display you have to stroll again to reach to first display

 There are more than 3000 reviews
 I am just here to share my observations... By roomates have a zenfone and moto E and note 1.
 I have moto go
 The 294ppi display icons still dont come close to note 1 having 285ppi.
 I am not talking about quality
 But the edges of text are whisper on note 1.
 It shouldn be thought
 The same goes with zenfone5, A very close inspection tells that zenfone may have higher pp but that is not the case took
 To i am special about it
 Coming to battery and charging Using samson and other charges The part near camera heat like hellll.. Sometimes the input precision gets bad
 You have to clear ram to get back to normal
 Gorilla Glass 3 claims are odd...
 The moto E and moto g 2 both have a bad quality glass too than note having GG1.
 HOW os THAT AGAIN POSSIBLE?? moto e display when pressed shows signs of display rainbow
 Moto go doesnt...
 But scratch test using a small stone showed bad results for both moto phone than note
 The battery percentage does not fall uniformly
 In a gameplay of 15 minutes
 It went from 67 to 63.
 But in next 15 minutes of standby it went to 54..
 It always happens only after gaming consumption

 I ordered MOTO G 2 mobile on with of october and received it on and of october full points to flipkart for delivering it before the expected time
 I was so excited to use the mobile but my excitement come to an end when i found that the mobile i received was faulty(It has a dark black spot in the upper left side of the screen
 The fault is a hardware fault
 I called the customer care service of flipkart on with of october
 The customer care guy told me that someone from technical team will call me within to days(before 26th) but on 26th(today) i get the message that they need more time to resolve my issue
 I dont understand why flipkart want more time to resolved this is not something that can be resolved over a call
 Only replacement can resolve this issue
 Flipkart: Please get it replaced as soon as possible

 I am using this Shone from 3 months I have not got any problem Like HANG, Battery let os RESTART which I faced when I was using Samsung phone
 Also network of MOTO G is very good To I am rating It has 5*.
 I will Recommend this Shone To every middle class People who can purchase Heavy Price Shone

 Vice phone I dont think i need to give you the ports or bones of this product since you can find an eternity of content on the web regarding moto go
 However I will give you the ports and bones of Flipkart's service
 cross The order placement was easy The one day delivery is a wonder got the phone within 22 hours of ordering
 The cracking of order is easy
 bones You do not get any status update on your product when the flipkart systems are busy
 You get the order delivered and after 4-5 hours the system shows that your order is in transit

 I would have rate the phone 5 stars but the major problem is with ringtones it rings late and waves between slow and high volume as result you tend to miss important modifications and calls.For many apes like fb,hangouts,messenger, it just doesn ring
 One can use short and sweet ringtones due this problems
 Its good for Nothing if you miss urgent calls throw such phone out from window Shone is meant for ringing normally but this phone sucks same is the issue with Moto Os I have been trying to get some help from customer care but they are monkeys
 I dont like the way the ringtone pattern is its not absolutely ridiculous waste of money buying a half dumb phone
 I wont recommend anyone buy a ringtone dumb phone

 Appearance wise this is cool but when it comes to performance wise it laws .RAM is not capable of handling multiple tasks hangs a lot !!!) Camera is good.Headsets are not up to the mark Os thought of buying a beatson
 Within 8 days of purchase the software crashed when I contracted the Customer care they said we will come to you within 2 days,but till this date no action has been taken worst customer care service When I reported it but again the software crashed need more patience I would say ) I would suggest go for phone that provide service centers near you and NOT FOR MOTOROLA os

 Excellent products everything is running smoothly
 Timely delivery
 You just need to replace the charger and headphone to make it ultimate
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update on 06/04/2015: I am using this products for last 7 months
 It becomes heating machine on data enabled mode
 You just canst hold this phone while using data and location service
 Low in opening contact and dial pad after 5.0 update which is not desired in a calling device
 Other than these everything is good
 FYI, it supports OTG.

 Its my primary phone Good Things 1. Camera is good but only in day light 2. System Plates are received faster 3. Built quality is good
 I have dropped phone several times with a case protection
 no scratch wear and tear Had Things 1. Terribly slow even slower than Moto e ( I own both have compared with other Moto G also
 I know the benchmarking and all
 I know on bench marks it will be placed higher than moto e
 But anyone just use both phone and compare moto e is noticeably faster
 Its very baggy in short 2. All quality is pathetic ( taking into account its 2014).
 Its so muffled can recognize the words and sentences
 Conclusion ask i think liability wise this phone is not so good

 His instance has by far been the worst shopping experience i have ever had with flipkart or any other site for that matter
 I ordered a Moto G order not - OD000945876499706200)in exchange for Foka Os - 02 on big billion day and a day after that ordered Mimi MI3 Order not - OD000948904972772200).
 The courier guy came to my residence on with October with the order and to my surprise both orders were in same package(which should not have been the case as 1 of the item was under exchange
 The battery of my return item Foka Os - 02 was not charged as the courier guy came without calling me so i had no time to charge the battery
 He said he cannot hand me over the order without confirming the IMEI not of the exchange item
 I said ok you wait I will charge the device
 He said I cannot wait and went back without handing me the order
 I told him least hand me over the Mimi MI3 for which i have paid in full and that is not under any exchange
 he said I cannot as both have the same cracking ID. yesterday i got a message that my order has been canceled
 I want to know who authorized the cancellation of the order
 His is sheer non sense on your part
 I am highly irate
 I have called the customer care least 10 times since yesterday
 I even visiting your warehouse facility in Patparganj Industrial Area last evening
 They also refused to hand me over my package for which i have paid full money
 They said return is marked on the order and they cannot help me
 Customer care says they also cannot help
 and i have to order the product again
 and when i tell them at xii mid is not available
 they say its your problem and you have to wait for it to be available again
 Now i dont know you guns track my order and I want the Mimi MI3 and I am not going to wait for
 Of this issue is not sorted out I assure you to take it to consumer court as the product i ordered for and paid in FULL by credit card was not handed over to me
 New things I want to know - 1.
 Why were 2 order rubbed under one ( when you knew 1 of them is under exchange 2. Now can you keep me from having something for which I have paid in full 3. Its been 12 days and I still dont have my handset.
 Must because of your silly mistaken
 I have suffered for so long
 When will i receive my Moto G and Men os MI3???????????

 Shone was delivered on time as per promised date in spite of the Fig Million May rush
 Buds to Flipkart on that
 Shone is very good for web-browsing, email twitching between multiple open applications
 However it looks like I got a defective piece
 Of you turn up the install volume to about 80% which is required to listen in even a slightly noisy environment the voice seems to crack badly - as if the apiece diaphragm is torn remember listening to audit on really cheap speakers how it feels?).
 Same is much more true for Loud speaker
 The call volume is low but more than that even for call to be audible in a relatively quiet house the volume level needs to be set to about 80-90%, and there the voice cracks much worse
 It is unbearable
 I tried various things tried SIM cards of Airtel, Vodafone as well as Data Docomo: all have full signal in my house and all of them have the same issue
 Important thing to note is it is only call quality that is so poor
 Of you play Music or Videos, they play fine
 Secondly battery back is terrible
 With moderate usage it does not last even 12-15 hours
 That is in the first 1-2 days of usage after full charge
 Of you brows continuously for about an hour or so the battery will drain easily by 40% I have raised a return request with Flipkart due to defective apiece & loudspeaker.
 I am hoping to get a refund

 Product feedback After using for three weeks os Camera is fabulous
 Its is just amazing to click photos and very convenient to record video and click selfish
 Back camera looks safe as it is almost at edges
 Design should have been secured this flaw
 os 16GB Internal memory makes it convenient to install as many apes as you want
 os Other specification did not respond negative os Processor laws at times
 os Battery lasts for one day
 Battery charging is a BIG PROBLEM.
 It takes more time to charge to deliver what it is giving
 Feedback to Flipkart: By product was channelized through your warehouse in Bhiwandi town but you were not delivering product to people living in Bhiwandi.
 Ridiculous that I had to bother some body in a different location to receive the shipments

 Moto G and Men is probably one of the best phone in this price range
 Though its price is 3000 Os more than Us zenfone 5 but its quality is way better than any phone in that range
 Also it comes with out of the box mitka 4.4.4
 version with a guaranteed update for andros L now known as lollipop).
 A great flaw in flipkart: wont ever use the services of Delivery courier facility
 It is probably the worst courier facility in terms of delivery time
 It took them almost 2 weeks to deliver my simple order
 Thumbs up for Google which is coming out with such great phone
 Expecting Google to launch more such phone now with the advent of MOTO 360.
 Thanks a lot!!!

 His Product is good
 Touch is wonderful North in Prices Battery performance seems good as at least as of now in Full 3G/H+ it is giving battery back more than 12 hours and in Wi-Fi it is even more
 Thing which disappointed me is Indian Local Languages like Gujarati isn supported You cannot write or you can not even read Gujarati webster in the browser, To think on this point if you used to open local websites.
 Delivery took long long time + Address given to courier guy by seller was not accurate enough to track my location He has to call me lot of time and I have to go and collect the product at some place mutually decided by Courier guy and me Pathetic..

 Writing this review after using this phone for 2 weeks and guess what no heating issues I faced.Smooth as butter and Installed 25+ apes but still have 8 go of from left
 PROS: 1.Better camera than the previous Moto Os 2.The screen is nice and is truly one water resistant one
 3.Speakers are nice they are STEREO and can make a difference while watching films 4.16 os ROM+ 32 os EXPANDABLE STORAGE, it is a game changes what more do you need
 5.Solid battery back CONS: 1.Battery drains out when camera runs for 30+ mind
 I DIDNT FOUND ANY MORE Os WORTH THE BUY GRAB THIS SOON

 I Frnds, I recently purchased this phone

 flipkart's delivery is very good
 but at first they delivered a defective product with speaker problem and worst battery life
 but i replaced the defective product and got a good one but within 5 days i accidently dropped the phone and the phone display with gorilla glass 3 cracked .
 although this a great phone by leading company motorola.
 PROS: excellent camera quality with imp attractive look with various skins available in flipkart good battery performance great gaming performance with no sign of lag{device comes with go ram faster internet browsing than samson and nikita 6.HD display is very nice excellent touch screen CONS: 1. the phone gets slightly heated up while using Os 2.accessories for the phone is quite costly build quality is not superb BOTTOM LINE: I will recommend moto grand genu for my friends and relatives

 I say this because it is one of the most talked phone and a very compact in nature
 Rose
 Good display
 dual him
 micro sd sloth
 upgradable to Android L and Lollipop when available
 Great combination with goose supported apes works relatively good
 Sons
 Camera does not focus near objects quickly
 Speakers are not good(at high volumes
 Other wise it is mind blowing

 I am writing this review after using this phone for a weeks
 the phone is really good but it has problem with the accessories provided with it 1 the hands free provided does not have good volume quality(loudness) 2. the charger gets heated soon 3 too long charging time
 4 phone also gets heated soon
 except this the phone has good features like 1 good speaker volume and also good sound 2 decent camera 3 good touch experience
 4 decent processor speed if possible preinstalled apes like file explorer and task manager should be given

 I did not expect this from motoroal.
 There is a small blue smudge on the top left corner of the new mobile
 I would like to get a replacement
 Otherwise the mobile seems to be good and has an excellent camera for its prices
 Have increased one star for quick response by the customer care cell and because an electronic item can have such problems which if replaced by the seller quickly is admirable
 Os of now flipkart has informed that they will do the replacement within 3 days
 waiting for the same
 Os mentioned by the customer care it was stated that the problem will be resolved by with by 11.30 am
 The first call itself came after the time and they suggested to install and try the software dead fixed detect from goose play station
 well it did not work and when I again called customer care they again took it as a fresh complaint stating the previous was resolved and have again changed the date to 31st.
 Excellent work flipkart.
 now i know how you guns state that you get the customer problem solved fast
 you just give a suggestion and state that the problem is solved and if the suggestion does not work you take it as a fresh complaint

 Very bad experience with Flipkart & totally disappointed with them this time
 I have taken many electronic products from Flipkart.com
 & having such good hope & Trust on their services but this time had worst experience
 I was very much impressed with Moto G and Men & received from Flipkart.
 I noticed Back panel having issue as its not fixed properly & Battery back issues & raised complaint with Flipkart on with Oct'14.
 They have advised me within days will get call from teach team & they will resolve the issue
 Unfortunately no one contracted me & i have raised multiple complaints for these issues every days once but so far no responses
 Finally raised replacement request they simple rejected without providing any valid reason for rejection
 I can see lot of changes in customer care especially response comparative to previous experience i use to get responses very effectively & timely for all these queried but know totally am looking confidence & trust on Flipkart.
 Its near to month from with Act no response & no resolution.... Its really Disappointed
 os Looking for resolution...

 Firstly great delivery from Flipkart.
 The phone is amazing right from the presence in your hands great touch quality no heating up issues as I read at many places , amazing brightness and display good rear camera with good forgetting option .
 Well I would not say about the front one as its just 2 MP.
 Good UI.
 Sons os Well I would say pp using some custom Android phone will have a learning curve for the stock andros here
 Great deal under 13000 getting this phone

 I got this phone on 22/10/2014 and after using 2 days than i write review I use any apes like whatsapp, like Twitter skype, even flipkart pp too and other in built apes after using these at least 5 to 10 min it starting heat fast
 Last and main if you use camera at least 2 min it heat up super fast in 1 min and due to heating problem full battery drop in 6 - 7 hours
 I have no idea what mean of 'Flipkart Advantage badge
 Products ragged with the Flipkart Advantage badge are quality checked i think 'Flipkart Advantage badge no mean it not quality checked
 Flipkart team fix this problem of my new phone ism too much frustration with heating problems

 hi flipkart, this is the second time i am complaining to you and i dont like it
 first time was when my headphones with my moto g and genu was not working i got a call and you all replaced it after a week when i got the new phone i asked the person delivering whether u get a us with it and he said yes i dont have a us connecting to any pp or lawton given to me within the box
 if u say that it is attached to the charger wire..it is stuck my friend
 i asked the guy can you remove it he said no madam its joint moreover the end of the wire is also not working so technically i cannot charge my phone i have to use a different one
 first the heaphones and now the charge
 what is this nonsense..can you not give me proper wires with my phone so that i can be happy and actually recommend it to people??? Thank You Radhika Hard

 specification wise its at par with all others in the same range but performance wise it sucks saying it after using two MOTO G2, had same issues in the first set provided by flipkart and the second one came with certain extra bonuses,,,, prose 1. on paper a great phone to play with great sappy processor a os of RAM, 8MP camera and all 2. Camera is good as compared to the previous version but not the best in segment but unable for me and for those who are not that camera julie 3. Front speakers loud speakers and timely updated of system softwares...the only 3 things that attracted ME...BUT YOU DON'T GET ATTRACTED..read all the reviews available at various forum do proper researches and read the below if you have time os cost 1.
 You get less free RAM, game clashes again and again..for instance if you play asphalt8 on it generally it starts the race and then clashes but many times when it is not in mood it will crash the time you hit the start race button if it can not hold these kind of games then for what 1GB RAM is meant for even Moto E is better than it in this section 2. heat up on 15 minutes continues use whether it s gaming or any other pp or just using the internet 3. not meant for pp lovers if you install a lots of different pp on the phone this phone is strictly not for you it only allows you to install unto 15-17 pp that too just basic apes not the heavy ones.... 4. every ones calling it cheaper nexus os YES it is cheaper but NOWHERE near NEXUS os in fact no where near CHota-Puraana moto G.... 5. another pp crashing instance is of the PLAYmusic and man it is a major one you stroll down at a certain speed and it clashes you search for some random song and it crashes...the best developed music pp terrified by goose clashes in such a great fashion....hail MOTO, Nail Flipkart and Nail hittttler, no offence Os buy it regret it feel free to curse the motorola and Flipkart by Statutory warning kiss i kahi-suni baton pe na jaayein, anna pain march are people istemaal margin fir wishawas karein...

 It is smooothh.
 I had a samson Os before and the new moto g is much faster than the Os and ism thoroughly delighted
 The stock andros on this device works great and you wont feel any lag at all
 The phone is fast but not that suited for multitasking given its 1 go ram limitation
 you cannot multitask running a game
 The camera click beautiful photos and the so mo video recording are fun to look at the build quality is top notch the people who know about moto g would be the only ones guessing this devices price right
 BEST phone BEST prices

 Moto Os much awaited mobile for me
 Almost after many days and nights of continuous explore on different mobile I finally decided to bag one Moto G2.
 Lovely to hold , carry and dismay
 The UI is just awesome folks
 The rich interface user friendly UI with cool presence the loose the colors ease of access of any item - what not everything is fabulous
 The speed , response from web pages desired output when performing something is truly responsive
 Stunning display with updated Android platform helps me to stick to mobile always
 The andros since goose account and helps you keep track of all notifications.
 very easy to install apes and so easy to access/run them
 Dual SIM, front and rear camera with flash good hardware specification and especially the solid body made me go crazy for it
 His is truly unprecedented smartphone mobile below15k bucks
 Would you like to experience the same
 When why later
 To and grab one for you and enjoy the beauty of smartphone only using Motoroll Moto G2.

 His phone has everything that you demand after paying 12999..good display,good camera and good processor only drawback is a little less RAM(it shed he been 1.5gb) and battery life(only 2070 mAH).
 With an ave use the battery last only for 24 hrs..so U need to charge it almost every day call quality and reception is also good can handle games like MC4, shalt with ease..and motorola has already confirmed that moto g will get andros 5.0 before winter break which is something that places this device far ahead from all other smartphones in the race

 The best phone for 13K .... Its got everything .

 The screen guard doesn have the goose log in white which gets faded on wiping or on regular usage which now left the customer septic about whether its a first hand or not

 Seems ok else

 PLUS - Delivery and shipments quite fast
 PLUS - Seems to be quite good devices speed camera touch weight sleek type

 MINUS - 1GB ram is not sufficient enough could have been least 2GB MINUS - The package does not comes with USB enabled connector/adapter, it just comes with power adapted only MINUS - For such a big 5 inch size device the back cover quality is not sufficient enough
 Overall I am satisfied with this moto go Os have been using apple for 5 yes and moved to andros now with this devices so far no issues and limitation worth for this money os

 but considering the cost its just too awesome and You canst make any difference until kept side by
 The built quality is quite excellent n not like a cheap Samsung phone plastics..
 I am happy to exchange my wife old Samsung s dues for this phone Thanks to flipkart for k cash back
 I am happy to float the baggy buggy phone os Wont know how my wife managed to use the s dues for more than an year such a happy phone Coming to battery section I see it gives a decent battery back for day with screen on time of hours with iii on for at least hours and with browsing time hours n a little of gaming .
 I heard a lot of battery issues with moto g and genet
 But it doesn seem to be in my cases browsing net I find inch screen is more handy for internet/games etc compared to my moto x 4.7 inch screen

 Reality 1.850 mb is the actual ram available 2.12.90 is the actual storage available.out of which go is already occupied the pre-installed apes and system data

 3.Charger is non-detachable.It doesn come with data cable
 Rose 1.A very good IPS 720p display
 2.Good quality camera.both
 rear and front
 3.OTG functionality.You can mount most of us drives like pendrives,mouse and mind keyboard
 4.Dual sim.micro only
 5.Ability to play many of large apes and games
 6.Antutu rating around 18000.
 7.Android 4.4.4 which can be upgrade to andros Os 8.Capacitive touch 9.Clear call receiving and making
 10.Dual and louder speaker Sons 1.Doesn't come with pre installed file manager pp
 2.Sound get distorted at high volume and sound quality both in earphone and speaker is average
 3.Sometimes him is not detected
 4.Only high quality gamepad are recognised by OTG not any simple gamepad

 A great experience with moto go

 all the features given in this phone are good
 best phone in this price range
 To such laws yet
 I have been using this phone for 3 weeks now am very satisfied with it
 The camera quality is not as good as sonya or samsung.
 The pictures look real as they are and do not add extra effect as we see inexperia or samsung(have experimented on it
 The secondary camera is really good no doubts about it
 battery back is fare
 With vigorous use it will die out faster as is the feature with all smartphones.But with average use it lasts for a day.yes
 one thing i found surprising was there was no file manager application to see the contents of the external cards
 But that is compensated with a file manager pp from goose play

 I ordered a Moto G and gen on th oct 2014 and received the same on th oct
 I was immediately let down after first boot as the display had a blue line on its left side
 other than that the phone was exceptional
 hence I requested a replacement an received the replacement the next day of my request
 Was happy with Flipkart os and was happy to see the display was okay after first boots
 But wen i tried to insert my him card after initial charging there was another problems
 the him keeps coming out as it doesn lock in the sloth
 was disappointed again as i can use it as a phone but just as a media player
 Both him slot had the problems
 I again requested a return
 and after 2 days a sweet voice from flipkart told me shell refund my money
 I objected as it was a phone i needed
 And after a lot of persuasion she agreed to send a replacement
 I received my third hands on with oct and wen i checked it also had the same problems
 the aims wont lock
 him otherwise happy with the set and ind desperately like to keep the phone
 But him afraid to order a replacement again as it may have worse faults
 him really disappointed with Quality assurance of both Flipkart & Motorola.
 To u think you can sell any cap to us customers
 two stars are for the prompt delivery & os and 1 for the phone
 the phone will get 2 more if i was able to insert a him and use it as a phone

 Moto g and gen provides amazing features at quite a fair price when compared to similar phone from other bands
 Android 4.4.4
 runs butter smooth on the device and i have faced no laws during the 1 week that iv been using the phone
 The battery issue is genuine
 but nothing is wrong with the battery
 It only needs to celebrate to display the proper battery percentage
 To a couple of complete recycle of the battery should do the trick
 I drained the battery full then charged it 100% and did this two times..now i have no issues with the battery..it lasts 1 full day and still has about 25% remaining
 For the downsides.. a it gets pretty warm near the camera while playing demanding games..even the screen gets hot while playing fruit ninja..something that also used to occur on my lucia 720.
 by The ram could have been 1.5gb...and 360 security almost always shows about 70% used..but considering the device never laws i guess the 1 go of ram does its job
 c i do wish the battery was removable but most phone are coming with non removable ones so that is fine
 Part from these i really have not faced any issues with it..and its quite a delight to use the phone
 However with the likes of sonya end lucia 730 and galaxy prime emerging into the scene i believe moto g and gen faces a tough competition
 It just goes to show no device can remain in the firelight for too long in this huge advancing teach market

 One of the best smartphone in this price range and it works very fine
 Of your budget is under 13,000, I would say go for Moto G and Men without hesitation
 have already used Moto G must Men and just received this Moto G and Men 2 weeks ago
 Pros.: Took and Design is very good
 Vice carve shape & Smooth backside.
 -5" os Display,Nice,Fast, Crisp and Livid
 The front Dual speakers are awesome, Loud n Clear All quality is also nice it has 2 miss with Noise Cancellation works fine To network problem in this model so far
 - 8 os main camera & 2 os front
 It takes amazing pictures so far both indoors and outdoor
 micro os slot up to 32GB great inclusion flag free latest Android 4.4.4
 (kitkat) Good processor & graphics speed You can play most of high end games
 Multitasking is also very smooth -Wifi conductivity is good works nice
 bones Video camera is good but not great
 Please put Damage Stabilization" in next edition
 Battery performance is average
 -Charger getting heated while doing charging
 Device also getting more heated with back covers
 -Headphones are not good...Cheap and useless for me
 Data cable for is an essential need which can be fulfilled
 Some reflected lines you can clearly see in the screen on sunlight
 His feel uncomfortable to see anything in devices screen on sunlight
 It last great job Flipkart u have delivered my phone much earlier than I expected
 Completely satisfied with the delivery service depend on seller and packing

 Really bad service provided by flipkart,unlike what they claim.My Moto G 2 gets badly heated up externally,which has caused superficial burns to me.Flipkart teach team takes more than 4 days to revert back and resolve my issue feel created by flipkart as a customers

 Since i bought the phone had put it on test for 3 weeks and i am writing this review after a thorough evaluation for 3 weeks
 I checked for each and every thing in the phone like battery life performance,multitasking, heavy games video calls,camera etc etc what i can say that the phone just fares well in every aspect
 i am getting 5 his of on screen time which is nearly 18 hours battery back on a single charge
 The new update has made the phone more smooth and fixed a few bursa
 The pure andros experience is just awesome.

 I purchased this phone 3-4 weeks ago from lip part and had done analysis for all pro and cost here is my observations by comparing Samsung Galaxy - Gros - Good battery Display is awesome, Camera is unbeatable....very good quality for pick and making moves processing speed is far better than samson Sons - All recorder does not work which is my requirements
 Older can not create in gallery can not delete multiple contracts in single shot
 Over all good phone and worth for money

 They immediately offered replacement in 3 days time

 Love Flipkart :-)

 In st day itself touch was not working and laws in between,don't forget Moto is bought by Novo so dont expect a good quality phone.Second flipkart's service has been worst they committed to resolve issue before and October and later they didn communicated

 Please think before buying from flipkart and Motorola's inferior phone

 Placed order yesterday about 8:30 and I received the product today at 12:00PM.
 Latest delivery I have ever seen
 And yes the phone is exceptional in performance and design.Nothing more to write about the products
 I have been recommending the phone to my friends and family since I bought my first Moto G and Gen).
 Of course its not a perfect phone but for the people who are looking for a good phone within INR 15,000.00,
 this is the best choice
 Highly recommended

 After 1 week of use I canst get any issue with the phone
 its performance is incomparably to other leading brand like samson and sonya

 You canst get any branded mobile with os display morning gorilla glass water resistance and assurance of Android L upgrade for price of 13000.
 Must close the eye and buy.........

 Rose - In os slot makes storage more comfortable - Bigger screen off course good for all games - Letter cam quality compared to previous edition - Slim and reduced weight makes better Sons - Cam quality has to be improved by Moto as it would be better if Karl Less are preferred with some additional cost Recommended for all users who dont depend of mobile cam as Moto needs to improve a lot on Camera features

 since i ordered this phone during the festive season so i had to wait a little longer for the delivery of the phone but as usual the packing was good and didn receive a defective piece as a few customers have complained
 prose * amazing build up as the phone looks awesome with its curly edges and back
 * despite having the same resolution as the previous moto go the resolution of this is pretty good
 * the processor and ram are ok as for now i haven faced any problems regarding the same
 * the rear camera is awesome with some amazing low light capturing abilities
 the same can be said for the front camera which produces decent pick
 the features included in the camera do full justice
 * the most amazing thing about the phone is its sensory
 the touch is brilliant and the motion sensory are awesome.
 * there is no heating problem either while playing games or charging
 * moto assist and migrate apes are a good inclusion
 * screen size is 5 inches so you enjoy video and games quite comfortably
 cost * i dont know whether its a problem or not but the lock and volume keys are a bit rocky
 it somehow gives you a feeling that they are loose but looks ok to me
 if your budget lies in between ask to 15k, this is the phone to spend money on
 great work by motorola and google.

Karthick
 Os usual flipkart did very good job in there service
 Not it delivered in 2 days
 And about the products
 Good products
 Not the white one
 1.
 The design and looks are very elegant
 2. Display is very good
 3. Performance is smooth
 Haven’t had a pitch till now
 One reason could be because of the basic andros version
 One down side for that is very limited settings
 For Samsung users it could be a trouble initially but once you get used to you dont find it bad at all 4. Camera is decent if not extraordinary
 5.
 About the battery
 When I charged it for the first time it got heated up
 But then on no heat issues till now
 Battery life is not very great but manageable.
 Overall for 13000 I would say its a good buy

 Order placed on th Act got delivered on with Act To practice information shared in the meantime on the whereabouts of the order the online cracking simply did not provide any updated
 Had to call customer care multiple times to get better updated but realized that they had no means to track the order status either and were never able to share a reliable expected delivery date - it simply kept moving ahead
 The product packing was average
 The phone box itself was bubble wrapped for added safety
 The old phone exchange process was seamless, no fuss
 The delayed delivery did spoil the party

Madhusudan GM
 I have purchased Moto Os on last Friday and it was delivered on Saturday itself !!.
 Thanks to Flipkart for the quick delivery!!.
 Moto Os looks great fit perfectly on hand and easy to use
 Touch is smooth and display is quite good
 I think they have concentrated on the features which can help them to complete in the market but laws the basic features
 Battery dries too fast
 I have to charge it twice a day :-(.
 Also there is a noise in the call auditor couldn talk longer on this phone
 I have raised return request to Flipkart to send the non-defective device
 Hopefully will get it replaced!!.
 Of Motorolla can fix these issues It will be hard for others to beat it in this segment

 Buds to flipkart for their service
 I got the product in a day
 Overall the phone is good with a battery life of a day good speakers
 The phone is not sturdy
 A simple fall and there is a break in the display
 Flipkart says that this product comes with a morning gorilla glass which gives extra protection
 But this is not true
 The front glass broke with a small accidental fall
 I had previously used Galaxy Os which was pretty good and withstood many falls without any problems
 From user experience the phone is good but from disability aspect I do not recommend this phone

 Hello everyone ....I ordered Moto G os genet on with September 2014....Delivered on with see 2014 evening
 I was not getting any type updation delivery status before with sept
 Os poor delivery service
 1. Screen Nice,Fast, crisp and vivid but only 720p.
 With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p.
 It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and unable in single hand
 2. Performance Android 4.4.4
 comes pre-installed.
 Lag-free so far
 Guns Riptide os pretty well
 Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400.
 os Officer Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine
 3. Round The front dual speakers are awesome.
 Very nice sound
 One of the other Boots (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity
 4. Camera 8 os main cam & 2 os front
 Very good snap so far both indoors and outdoor
 Not only 20 mind to experiment os 5.
 All quality 2 miss with noise cancellation and a loud speaker
 Feels good
 6. Micro os Clot His is the greatest inclusion
 Moto G sorely missed that
 Good option
 7. That else do you want
 os simon guns what else do you expect from a phone at this price point
 It wont cook your meals or solve your financial problems
 Use it practically
 its a good deal
 The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses
 Overall i can say Moto Os phone is awesome in this Danger
 I am satisfied with this Shone
 Hands 2 all

 I just gone through the hardware and software specification of Moto G From internet and decided to buy without looking the product practically
 To doubt the hardware of the phone is quite enough fast but Software is very very poor
 Now I came to understand the failure of Mortrola and Foka in the Market
 The worst policies of the company have dropped them on the floor
 In Moto G you cannot assign a different ringtone or wallpaper on different him
 You cannot set default him to call
 Very time you need to select the him for calling
 You cannot block a person from calling
 Of you unload a third party ringtone it does not repeat at all
 It rings once only and gets mute
 To many future are quite missing if we compare with samsung.
 While attaching a photograph with contact you cannot crop the photo even
 While display on calling photo is not being displayed properly
 The worst software
 I ready to return it with loss of Os 1000 or more

 Product is very good Delivery is excellent.Only problem is it would've been better if i knew the product was coming one day before so that i could plan my day accordingly

sudeep mishra
 Quick Joints * battery drains too fast but this issue has been fixed after a update provided by MOTO * Shone is not very good at RAM management
 All drop rate is too high if talking over g network for voice call
 * Front Cam is good for occasional selfish
 Recent display and design
 * Os a decent package but not the best now
 And last but not the least...as many other customers also said that flipkart is not good at its after sales service
 I have experienced it with several products earlier...so you are buying any product at your own risk and luck over flipkart.
 Os best of luck

 Hope they will keep it up
 Have been using the device for the last two days
 The device is good in looks camera is very good no last Pp run smooth
 Video quality is OK, though not excellent weight of the device could have been reduced gets slightly heated up while on Type video call but no complaints about call quality
 Data cable for transferring files from computer is an essential need which can be fulfilled
 Over all a Great Product for the price and additional discount of 10% on SBI Debit cards is an iting on the cake

 If and internet g conductivity is not up to the mark
 By lawton conductivity is better
 display quality is very good
 But the mobile look is not so great as it appears on the os screen
 It looks similar to samson dust
 Any how I bought a black lip cover for this ear phone which comes with in the box is not so good

 I bought this phone for my dad
 I was expecting one day delivery but the phone was delivered one day late despite being Flipkart First
 Before giving it to my dad i used this phone for one weeks
 Gros 1. Battery life is very good
 Even while playing shalt 8 the percentage of battery drained was fare less
 2. It doesn need 2 go ram
 It was very efficient while multitasking.
 3. The video quality is amazing
 4. Speakers are in front 5. Modifications are loud which is very important 6.
 All quality is absolutely awesome.
 You don t need to put the phone on your ears
 sons 1.
 Os everyone I was expecting B ram 2. Battery capacity could be more
 I will recommend you to buy this phone
 His phone has more than enough features available that are enough for lot of people
 One thing that I noticed is if you go to a mobile shop and ask for a moto phone that happens nothing to laugh about they mock moto phone
 By dad was told the andros is not genuine and all kind of sale pitch they could have thrown
 Please dont listen to them
 His is a goose phone and you know goose is god

 Ought this on the Fig B day
 The exchange and the product delivery went smooth
 The phone arrived well packed and protected
 However once I finished all the settings and tried to restarted the phone cocked off and does not turn back on
 Placed a request for a replacement request with Flipkart, but I must say I am very disappointed with the post sales support
 They need a purification call to be completed before they can process the replacement and have been waiting for the phone to ring since the last 3 days
 I have for now got myself an expensive paper weight

 First of all i bought 2 Os of Moto G2, first for my uncle and later for myself on with October 2014.
 For the first few days i noticed that the battery was draining way too fast compared to my 5'' Micromax Canvas 2 which lasted 18 his in comparison with 12 Mrs on Moto Os with the same 2000 Ah battery
 Yesterday onwards with & with Act I noted that ism not able to hear what the other person is saying irrespective of which him ism making/receiving the call
 the other end person called me 4-5 times
 i called him back 3-4 times
 same issue.Only solution i found was to report which fixes it for some time
 When issue comes back it has occurred now for 4 times in 2 days
 Today i called up my uncle to know his feedback and ism anxious to hear that hers facing the same issue
 Are any others facing this issue
 ism planning for a refund if the issue is persisting

 I received a used mobile by flipkart.
 I received it from flipkart and open the box and immediately able to figure out that I received a used product as someone bought it placed screen-guard on it which is available in market and returned it to flipkart and flipkart sold that product to me
 Though I immediately placed the return request but I am extremely sad by this way of flipkart.
 Earlier I bought MOTO E from flipkart and well aware of packing and first look of the phone
 His tricky game of the seller flipkart is really worst experience for me

 Hello everyone today i am going to share with you my 1 month of experience using moto g and genet
 Rose - Fig screen with good resolution
 - camera is great - includes many goose built apes - 1 go ram is sufficient if you are not a terrific game - light weight - battery back is sufficient Sons - Takes unto 2-3 his to get fully charged - Battery gets drained faster is data is on - gets i little bit of hot if used continuously for a long time Overall i would like to say that Moto G and gen is a good mobile in the prices if your budget is that much
 otherwise you can get some mobile with same features at a very low cost but those may be like china mobile and moto g 2 is a branded phone so those who have a good budget unto 13 k i would recommend them all to buy a moto g 2 because this is a good company phone and you can rely on it rather than buying china material like axiom mind red mid asus).
 Thankyou

 Well this is really not a product review !
 His is review of Flipkart.
 Product booked on Million day i.e.6th Act and Flipkart committed delivery by with Act The product actually delivered on with October !
 There was no dating about the delivery status and I had to complaint Flipkart customer care
 His is really unexpected
 To Flipkart eat as much you can digest !
 When Logistics and order booking systems are not unto the mark dont go for BILLION DAY gimmick to fool people and push them to mental agony
 I will think twice now on wards before recommending anyone Flipkart.

 * Good phone price wise * Battery drains out very fast lasts only 6-7 hours if data enabled
 * Mobile heat up
 Especially when you charge it with power bank it becomes really hot
 * Picture quality not so good being an 8 os camera it should click clear and sharp images
 * To start option - you have to switch the phone off and then switch it back on
 ******After the latest update (kitkat to lollipop) the phone battery performance has dropped drastically.....:( I have to charge the phone three times a day even when the locations wife are disabled.....I wonder what will happen if all the features are enabled.......

 Quality worth the price.You can go for the mobile if in need of mobile less than 15000 .

 I got my Moto G on 16/10/2014 and now i find that the speaker of my phone is not working properly and it is creating voice while talking on phone and also while playing music i asked for replacement and got confirmation that someone will call by 19/10/14, 1:30 os and i received call but no one spoke on other line nearly for 30 see and then i receive SMS that i will receive call by 20/10/14 what this practise indicates I am not able to figure it out
 Yesterday i also came to know that one of my friend has also bought Moto G and he has three times asked for replacement and each time the product supplied was defective
 Very much afraid that i will be able to get genuine and lawless product or not

 Only issue was with exchange was the vendor was asking for Phone+headset+charger+box+original Bill.......whereas flipkart had asked me to give only phone through email and even their contact center told the same thing.....After repeated follow up with flipkart customer care the issue was resolved and we had to give phone+headset+charger and the product which was expected on th Oct...was finally handed over to me on th Act

 I ordered this phone on flipkart's Fig billion day & was delivered in few days
 It worked great for 2 days
 But on rd day it started hanging itself & becomes unusable.
 I tried removing 2 games to see if it was causing any issues but it did not resolve the problems
 When finally I factory rest the phone this too did not resolve the problem of hanging
 It hangs for few minutes making the phone totally unusable.
 I checked with some of my office colleagues & they too faced the same problem with Moto G(2nd Men & they got it replaced
 Was not expecting this from Motor after all there were good reviews from all for this model

Really Very Good Mobile , Camera Performance is Good and the screen looks very Impressive for the price and since i have been using this phone for about 3 day but i didn even find a single lag in this phone even though i have installed lots of apes of about 3.2 os but no laws so that good and the Gaming Performance is decent , Storage is sufficient for me , it Supports Os functionality etc... and coming about the sons 1 os of RAM is not enough as the phone consumed of about 74% of my mobile Am Usage may Mary According to the Serf , Am could have been better that all and nothing about sons about this device Finally i conclude that it is a very good budget phone that perform good for its price..Surely u An go for this mobile...!!

 I am happy to receive the mobile from flipkart before the shipping date they initially mentioned
 Os I have gifted this phone to my mother I am happy it came before diwali.
 Flipkart is great!!!
 I ordered this product on big billion day with exchange offer but due to some technical pitch the price didn reduced when during checkout, I tried 7-8 times but was unable to get the discount however I ordered the phone and 2-3 days later i received a call from flipkart who said they apologize for the cause and provided me a discount of Os 1000/- due to inconvenience caused which actually make me happy
 Now regarding the phone everything is good and the quality is what you expect from 20-25K phone
 The performance of the phone is good nice proportions and white color looks killer in your hands
 All the specification indicate a great product which indeed it is
 The main thing is the camera which i would like to discuss as it cannot be only specified my megapixels but rather needs a description
 Rose 1.
 First of all the camera has a good resolution and images are less noisy if viewed on a lawton screen
 2. Great performance of camera even in low light which I didn expected at this price point
 A great camera for indoor photographs
 ( for example the camera of MOTO Os is better than Bony Peri L which my wife uses 2. Colors are natural and does not gives any artificial effect and the overall result is very appealing to eyes
 Sons 1.
 One minute drawback with the camera is that your hands need to be very sturdy for a perfect shot ( i guess there is no optical stabilization).
 Os I use Foka lucia 720 I am spoiled os by the great camera performance which i have seen either in lucia or some high end phone like nexus (apprx.
 30-35K).
 however one can download goose camera pp for a slightly better camera performance
 2. Front camera is average and not very good
 In all I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a tight budget constraint i would say best phone under Os
 20,000/-), instead of going to category B bands MOTOROLA gives a great package which tricks all the essentials + some extra

 back is also very good
 But motorola is no managing its service centers properly.Went today to a service center to repair my moto g 1 water damaged cell.it got shifted and address is not updated in site.had to travel full town.also
 if moto os are not water secure pus stop relating it to water repellent as there were more cases there.and
 cost for repair is 8000,which is the price of moto g 1 itself now

 3)OVERHEATING takes place during taking photographs video shooting playing James on this mobile
 4)During charging of this mobile the Charger and mobile both are OVERHEATING.
 os camera quality is poor
 os Battery drains very fast and gets overheard very quickly
 os moto g and gen which I have received is defective mobile so I request flipkart to please help me , take this defective mobile back and please give me refund or replacement
 this order in my lifetime is my first order with flipkart so I request flipkart to please give me refund or replacement otherwise I will never buy any product from flipkart

 Since buying xiaomi mid is very difficult given flipkart's inefficiency in selling it
 motor and gen is a good buy at this prices
 it sure has a little extra in every specification as compared to motoG1.
 But moto go sure does provide much extra at that k price in cases
 Yes the phone with a bigger screen now feels little big when compared to motor 1.
 Even the speakers at front helps in case you have left the phone or bed
 but the sound is not loud enough moreover sounds tend to break off sometimes
 In short even after the more things provided by moto it still isn as satisfactory as the st gen Os its an overall good phone a that pricepoint

 The phone has everything you just want full of features and classifications.The battery of this phone must need to increased.Not poor but good battery very good feature just introduced in it is the Printing module added in it.So you can connect to your printer with Moto g by getting If facility and print your document from any where in home.....Micro - him facility must be discarded by the company its a good headache for me....

 Letter than any other phone which relief in this segment .
 the phone comes with a great design and performances the samson market Dominant lacks design in their phone.... every phone of samson is same in looks whether it is k or ask ..... lets come back to phone .... prose os nice primary and secondary camera os Dual front speakers are Excellent 3-gaming performance is awersome.... can easily play high-end games works smoothly...display is also great as per the review many says that it is a theater phone.......... but Really as per my experience Nothing is such like that !!!!!!! its a great phone in every manner.... CONS Mind nothing such in a phone .....but Accesories of this are not to good...charger heat up very soon also the phone take too much time in charging 3-4 he .... the worse thing of this phone is its earphone...By seeing them u will feel that it will not costs more than 100rs... made with cheap quality..... os SEEMS THAT MOTOROLA HAS PUT ALL THE EFFORTS os THEIR PHONE ... NOT os ACCESSORIES ... FINAL VERDICT --- AFFORDABLE ,1000 TIMES BETTER THAN OTHER BRANDS (samsung,sony,htc) os PRICE, LOOKS, PERFORMANCE etc... rating 5/5( os THROUGH os )

 Earphones are having poor quality I still use my old shone Earphones.
 Good Joint in the phone is its look performance and prices

 Product is good
 Features build quality value for money proposition and all the latest teach makes Moto g an excellent buy
 Although hands free is very cheap grade
 Would need separate data cable for interlacing with PC.
 Shone though feels premium is a little too big because its 5 inches screen
 That said that makes watching video n reading a pleasure
 Must that its not comfortable putting it in jeans and travelling or driving
 him just making a point and not complaining
 Flipkart service was pathetic this time and it took them 9 days to deliver despite raising so many request through mail n phone
 I needed the phone urgently n they delivered it a day later
 Would have given 5 stars but os scored os hence 4*.

 And as to consider processor performance and gaming , ...... the moto g and gen works smooth without any laws as much of my notice and most of the games work that too on highest graphics configuration..... Also considering the battery of the phone...... it gives you decent battery life , which wont leave you much disappointed unless you have high hopes from a ask phone.......... on medium usage it might survive for a day and on high usage the battery fades away within 10 to 12 hours or less...... also for the first 2 days i notice that the signals totally dropped in between and after a minute or two it would come back..... but later the problem got fixed by itself ......... Also .....not to forget the sterno speakers give a loud and clear performance without any noise or anything of that sort.......... Anyway in short .... if you want all the best features in a smartfone at this range....
 I suggest you better go for it..!

 I have ordered the phone 30 days back the delivery service of the Flipkart was awesomeee.
 i just got the phone in 3 days from the date of booking and to say about the smart phone Moto go it was good in performance but we cannot find all the features where we can find in other phone like Riding unwanted applications in the menu not getting full picture of contact when someone calls us
 i was very disappointed in this features Cannot go to option of contact in shortcuts need to go through the menu Cannot surf internet when speaking on calls Voice clarity is fine and music and Gaming effect is good

 Worst service from flipkart!.....After using moto e I became a huge fan of motorola so when i lost my moto e I decided to upgrade to moto g2....It took 7 days for delivery...inspite of the delay i was so excited to open the box to find MOTO E in my package....I paid the price of go for e....Greatly disappointed
 It took lot of convincing of the customer care guy to take back the package immediately...flipkart was humble enough to accept their good up and returned my money immediately
 I on the other hand will not buy anything from flipkart.
 I have canceled my order...will search for some other mobile
 will miss motor

 It is a very good products had order it for my brother but older Moto G had better battery backup.
 With full Os on It lasts only 12-16 hours
 By Moto E lasts more than 24 days with same usage
 Of you are not a heavy user then this would be best phone if battery back is not a problems

 I have been using Moto go since a month ago but not yet found any kind of technical defects
 All the functions are working fine
 Flipkart is doing its job well I received my phone in just 3 days
 By cousin also bought Moto Os from Flipkart as per my recommendation
 In all thank you Motorola & Flipkart for rendering good service to us

 Camera is not of good quality if the functions are concerned though picture is of good quality
 Clarity speed are all fine but liability as compared to other phone need to be improved

 The product is good and meets expectations
 Though the product got delivered by the date as mentioned by Flipkart, but the delivery courier service (delhivery.com) is too bad the item moves for 2 days in bangalore from one place to another and then takes 3 days to deliver after reaching the destination

 Not this phone yesterday Quite disappointed by flipkart this time as it was told that the expected date of delivery is with of Oct'2014 but there was no call or text sent to me
 The delivery guy left the package to some one else which normally does not happen with flipkart people
 Speaking about phone Only concern is the quality of accessories provided with this which is not of a very good quality
 All the other features are good enough at this prices

 Have used both the generation of Moto Os Its good in all aspect and so many review already mentioned Gros and sons hence not worth to mention again
 Its better from st Men MOTO G in terms of screen size expandable memory and Camera
 But time has changed from last launch this launch and various other option like Zenphone, MI3, RedMi etc are available with better configuration but I prefer it because it was tried and tested and available under exchange offer
 Moto should have improve its RAM and processor chip set
 Did not like Front speaker design

 I ordered this phone on 06/10/2014 - Fig day and received a defective piece on 08/10/2014 & requested for replacement on the same day.Till day I have not received my replacement mobile
 From 08/10/2014 it is in transit till date,each time when I call customer care,they say same thing that your product is under shipment & expected in Perumbur hub...it wont even take 24 hours to reach from Bangalore to Chennai...mine is taking whole 8 days to reach my place...really fed up calling customer care guys.....one of my friend ordered the same MOTO G and Men two days back and he had received the same....but mine is still in transit.....it is SIN to ask for replacement.....this will be my final purchase with you.....at least deliver my replacement to the earliest......No reply even after calling many times to Customer care....at least refund my hard earned money....I can purchase from some other websites.

 i got this phone on exchange offer from flipkart , though the exchange offer sucks but the phone moto g is pretty good mediocre phone.it
 fits in my budget
 features are pretty good but not comparable to high end phone but easily comparable to this phone price range
 Battery life sucks Display is pretty good and clear To laws yet 5 inch screen is very good mitka

 Ought Moto G - 2 a month ago
 Features are awesome.
 Dual speaker adds a great volume to music and d effect
 Was little dissatisfied with the Battery back originally and requested for an exchange but found after regular use and charges for 15-20 days the battery now indeed has a full day back up after moderate use 5 inch os display give a great experience watching moves and playing games
 Played high graphics games with no last
 To it you are looking for a brand phone with exceptional prices
 purchase the phone with your eyes closed

 Moto G and has number of limitations as compare to Previous Version)Moto G(1st).
 1.Touch Sensitivity is not better then Moto G(1st).
 2.Icon size bigger then Moto G(1st) which makes it little odd
 3.Moto G(1st) has better look then Moto G(2nd).
 4.Feels little bad then Moto G(1st).
 5.Color quality of Moto G(1st) better then Moto G(2nd).

 Not phone delivered in one day Thanks to flipkart Have good battery backup, considering the increase in screen size and keeping the 2070mAh battery same as MOTO G st gen Smooth transition between the apes To hang and fast response
