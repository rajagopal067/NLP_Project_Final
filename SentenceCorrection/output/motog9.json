 I was excited on receiving the Motorola much awaited MOTO G2, and was pleased with the use of the products
 However After six months of use I was let down and was much disappointed as the phone refused to charge and my heart was melting as I saw the battery go dead
 I have lost all my precious data and photo
 Such disappointed I read that this is a common problem with the product and all the advised solutions did not help me with my phone

 Good overall performance but very bad battery backup...After charging for almost 4-5 hours the battery drains very quickly...!!!
 The new Novo A6000 is a much better option than this phone
 Giving features does not make sense if the battery back is that bad
 Would definitely not recommend this to a friend of mine
 MOTO seriously needs to work on the battery drain issue... Flipkart should know this is hurting their customers...and their hard earned money took

 I bought this phone and not at all satisfied with its features and performance 1.
 You cannot set ringtone other than default
 It pick up may songs from your memory card however when you choose same to be ringtone it does not work
 I tried multiple ways like copying into ringtones etc none worked
 2. It hung few times 3.
 I got replaced product which was worse than original
 I even doubt if it was new
 It had multiple issue with hanging abrupt behavior like mixing venus and home screen images etc
 I finally returned and waiting for refund

 I have been using this phone since some time now
 Very good camera and good sound due to front speakers
 Performance is very good
 Not 4.4.4
 andros when it came and now got a free upgrade to andros 5 lollipop.
 New OS is better and very smooth
 Internal 16GB memory works for me
 I have put additional 16 os MicroSD.
 Dual him good but not dual active standby.
 Only one SIM active at a time
 Shone is robust and can work with multiple applications without crashing

 I got moto go on and march and after 10-12 days only I got below defects : 1. a big one is some time battery % is not showing correctly like if it got 100 % charged but even after 3-5 hours battery % shows 100 that can not be correct
 and after start it drains drastically.
 2. some times while starting pp half of the screen shows black and it comes to normal if I minimize and minimize it once again
 3. some times light does not get on for oncoming call
 4. All quality is not so good sound volume fluctuates during call
 All these defects and not constant but it happens occasionally for now not sure about future
 I will be going to replace and hope will get a new one without any defects

 I have switched from a Gumma 720 to this phone and though the Gumma was worth ask at the time I bought it it was worth it
 Specially the pictures that I was able to take from my 720 were unbelievable so the ask were well spent keeping in mind the fluidity of Windows Shone OS.
 The 720 is now outdated but still works as smooth as any phone but I had to get a phone which had better specie was fluid and could take decent photos if not better
 And after reading hundreds of reviews and watching around 20-30 video I had to pick up this phone
 Never was a fan of customized android.
 Coming to the Moto Os 1.
 The stability of stock andros and lollipop which came preinstalled is amazing
 I have faced minor hiccups only when I have clot of apes open in the background and multitaking between heavy apply
 Still the issues are rare and the phone is a charm when it comes to fluidity.
 os 2. Battery is almost the same as 720 which had 2000 Ah where as here its 100 more
 You can expect an andros to give you 2 days like my Windows Shone but I am okay which the back that lollipop provides
 Does easily for a full day on normal use charging speed is lower but gets full in 4 hours
 os 3. Build is smooth and the phone in no way looks cheap and has a rubber feel in the black model
 Though gripping it can be uneasy as it as thin edges and a 5 inch is a big size anyway
 It all depends on how carefully you hold it
 0.5 4. The photos taken were decent in day light and the speed was good in capturing
 In low light the pictures could have been better
 Frankly I already knew this model was not meant to take best photo
 -0.5 5.
 I missed the ability to double tap to wake which is present on WP. and also the people Sub which includes smart linking of social contact with phone number thus providing social needs for each contact
 That also meant the persons Facebook picture gets auto added to the contact profile
 I did find the syncope
 pp to do this
 6. Applications and games running absolutely fine and you can multitask without issues
 Resuming is fast if you dont have huge games installed
 Smooth keeping in mind it has only 1 B ram - 1 I will add an additional star for the price of the product keeping in mind the brand and the fact that lollipop came installed and without any hiccups or bursa
 A must get under 15K INR if you like stock android.

 The moto G improves on what its processor lacked micro os card slot,beautiful os inch display and 8MP camera .
 Gros -5" display front speakers are loud n clear no network or call drops -8MP camera takes amazing pictures when HDR mode is on micro os slot up to 32gb bones there were no bones in the device whatsoever but the charger shipped with this phone heat up like a often rocky
 And battery performance is average

 Moto G and Men by Motorola is surely a value for money as it guarantees up to date software updated along with useful Motorola apes that help you to transfer contents from your old phone to your brand new Moto Os 16GB space along with Micro USB slot is good enough for any user
 I would recommend any buyer looking for a phone in this range should go for Moto G or HTC Desire 616.

 I dont write reviews until I use the product for couple of months and get knowledge of what the product is
 Were are the pro and sons of the MOTO G and Generation
 Initial order I got the phone which got switched off and never turned on in one day
 I reported to flipkart and got the replacement for the same
 New one is working properly
 Rose 1. Front and back camera quality both for photo and video excellent
 2. speed increases after lollipop updated
 3. modifications are fine after lollipop updated
 4. speakers sound is good
 5. battery back is good if not using any internet
 Sons 1.
 Little big that we cannot hold with single hand and operate
 While with moto E we can 2. Network problems
 Internet Os services doesn work properly
 It requires huge signal area to get Os internet
 Whereas my samson galaxy tax 2 able to receive Os signals at the same place
 3. Charging the phone takes a lot of time
 I figured that the problem is with the charger because when I use the samsung's charger for this phone it charges very quickly
 4. speaker quality on high volume is not good
 5. sometimes playing games like subways suffer degraded the performance for sometimes
 6. RAM is not enough for this phone
 least 2GB should be there
 7. battery drains quickly on continuous usage of internet less than 12 his
 For any other information kindly comment I will get back to you

 The phone given by Flipkart is defective

 When i ordered Moto G at the first place there was a buzzing sound in speakers when on call or playing music
 I called flipkart for the replacement and requested for a better hands this time
 The replaced set i got was even more faulty problem with speakers persisted screen went into the blink mode like a disco light
 It kept on hanging quite often without any heavy pp download and minimal usage

 Love my new motor phone that I got from Flipkart.
 One of the best phone that I have ever used
 Almost as sturdy as old nikita phone in terms of basic call/msg functionality and more smart & fast that Samsung smart phone that I owned before
 Moto is the way to go in smart phone space - love it
 Biggest Advantage of motor after 8 months of using the phone its agile & fast & extremely reliable
 Good voice & smart functionalities.
 I would give an arm & a leg as they say to get a good performance smart mobile after I was begged by my slow as snail samsung' that used to hang every now and then to the extent that I was afraid the set will be of no use even in emergencies that still take about 2-3mins for me to even do simplest stuff like make a call or send an sums
 After Samsung experience motor is like a dream
 I love the set for basis & 'smarts' took
 Small disadvantage To prepare those of us who are going to get their st ever Motor wanted to add a word of warning on what I initially missed on my MotoiG idea those simple built in samson apes like Mile Manager Voice Recorder even the Weather Ridge on desktop in fact:-) etc on motor which I had got used to on my previous slower than snail Samsung' set
 Round these apes easily downloadable from Playstore While Manager pp Super Voice Recorder pp The Weather Channel etc so that issue was solved in a months
 An appreciate the pure andros packing of Motorola however probably one of the reasons for its speed & reliability so this was a petty issue in final reckoning
 Verdict Will surely recommend motor smart phone to my friends it was recommended to e by a cadet our friend in the first place when I was rattling with the slllooowww past samson mobile

 I ordered this mobile on jan 14 th of 2015 and i got this mobile on jan 16 the
 I am happy for the fast delivery but the movement i used this mobile for couple of days the display is not working i dont what happened
 I didn expect this from MOTO G 2 mobile.May be i got the defeated piece which was given by Filpkart.
 After that i gave my mobile to service center which is in rajaji nagar,bangalore some what close to my location.They told me that phone is dead
 I raised a question for the reason because i used this mobile for just couple of days
 They said " we dont know about that we will send this moto g 2 to another Moto service center and it will take 15 to 20 business days
 I dont why they asked that much days.Finally i collected my mobile on march 12th.Now i tried to charge my mobile but it is not charging
 See how bad it is which is delivered by FILPKART.
 After that i called filpkart executive they again told to visit service center
 Please dont purchase this mobile from filpkart.There is no guarantee on this MOTO G 2 in flipkart.Very very very bad product which i got from FILPKART.

 Ordered Moto G on the th of this months got it delivered today
 Well from where I stay Siliguri, West Bengal and say the delivery was pretty much on the clock
 And now the initial impressions on the device itself after thoroughly using it for around 7-8 his the phone delivers what it promises Glass sturdiness, latest OS (Lollipop), camera features battery back (haven't tested the battery thou).But, lets see how Moto G perform against equally strong contended in the market and within this price range
 But overall feel somewhat confident that this devices donna last for a very long time in my kind of hands

 Service from Flipkart is really appreciable along with customer support delivery return policy offers

 After ordering this phone I was packing a bit since there are a lot of reviews complaining of problems
 It seemed like a luck of draw that I would receive a not-so-problematic device
 I almost canceled my order but then thought me
 It was delivered within 24 hours to me that is clearly a plus point for flipkart.
 Not for the phone all those people out there who rate a product low because flipkart missed up your delivery
 I have to say the first night I used it it seemed like that I received a defective piece with poor earphone volume poor speaker volume and a really bad battery
 And the metal strip almost burned my ears
 Of that had gone for two-three more days I would have just returned the damn things
 However its been almost 10 days now and the battery is a powerhouse, I have to say
 him getting a ~14-15 hours battery back on an all-time-3G, all-syncs-on, os hour web browsing and IM.
 And it stays at a working temperature of 30-35 Os The screen perform unexpectedly well in even very bright sunlight
 Os far as that goes him having almost the same experience as my previous lucia 720 which used to give me battery back of ~20-22 hours thought
 The well
 Os of now I am having no issues with calling both cellular and voice although the sound system could've been made a bit more better
 But it works no static no unexpected drops no so-called hissing noise
 The camera is okay
 I didn expect the front camera to be good but it actually turned out to be really good
 However although its true for almost any phone camera in Foka Gumma work better even when they are of less resolution
 By lucia 720's 6.7MP worked better than this ones 8MP.
 But dont let a not-so-good camera stop you from buying this
 him not going to state the obvious andros issues and advantages
 I dont do heavy gaming or anything so I dont know whether the RAM is enough
 By opinion Of you want to stick to ~12-14k, buy this one
 Otherwise shell out a few more bucks and get a One Plus One

 It is a nice smart phone in terms of usage and its looks
 But the Opens are not unto other mobile like Micromax, Lenovo,Redmi etc.., for the price of 13K, which is making to think twice to go for this.Shelling out 13K for this mobile is not worth , yeah but for a normal users with good and grand look , it is Good
 Camera and Internet breakers have to carry the USB charger all the way wherever you go Battery dies all the time and runs out of power
 Maximum of goose applications like Google , HangoutGmail Pp etc are consuming more battery , wherein , we cannot install those Pp as well Which is a sad part again
 *******OVERALL SIMPLY GOOD SMART PHONE WITH GRAND LOOK AND MEDIUM SPECS**********

 Hello to everyone....
 I am writing this review after using this product for about 2 months
 I got to know about this product from one of my cousin was interested in buying zenfone..But after seeing and hearing about this products I felt like having a go to Moto G2.
 Ordered this product through flipkart and am very much satisfied @ their service
 Though I got a defective product @ first flipkart provided me a replacement
 both the times I received the product within 2 days of order
 Now coming to the phone its absolutely superb
 Os guaranteed my phone got upgrade to Android Os Its camera,stereo,touch etc everything is fine
 His product gives good feature and its worth for the money
 The only con I find it right now is that the battery performance is bit average
 Charger provided takes lot of time for charging
 Also if the data cable had been provided it would have been better
 To I suggest new buyers to give a try for this products

 But on 27.02.15 the display of this phone was with full of distortion .
 I contracted flipkart and Yerrasura Mayusha of flipkart advised me to contact the service center .
 I reported to them promptly on the same day but they denied to repair the phone under warranty and demanded Os 6495/-.
 I intimated this problem to flipkart also and they took the matter but later they also confirmed that motorola is not ready to give warranty
 I had a chat with Burri Balraj of Motorola who asked to forward the screen shot
 I a forwarded the same along with voice raised by flipkart.
 By claim is that the reason of malfunctioning is certainly not due to any mishandling as the phone has not got a single scratch on its body which is ample prove that phone has been handled very carefully
 they allotted me Customer Reference number :150309-009128 and Motorola E-Mail Team member Arunjyothi had a talk
 The intimated that she is forwarding the case to higher level so that they might help in any possible way
 But they send me a mail on 11.03.15 that they have not heard from me concerning my request for support in the 48 hours since they sent you a response
 Consequently they have changed the status of my question to Solved
 His is the way motorola is cheating customers
 Ll do not but any motortola product if you want to live peacefully

 Before getting this phone i desire to get the phone more nearer to Google but should be below 20k.
 Os i found this and made the order and here is my products
 I am using this phone from last one and half months
 You get everything in this phone what a true Android can offer talking about product specification camera which is better than Bony but one point less than Apple good video recording similar to Bony best smartphone, better screen resolution relative to any other smartphone except Phone
 os problem of mobile hang But the time when you upgrade the Shone to Lollypop, the phone become responsive several times phone battery back lowers and the mobile internet dead and conjure on some occasions and even if you have to made important calls the phone love to be in responsive mode
 To buyers are requested to not to upgrade to Lollypop, and also be appraised that i have not download anything on my phone neither i have watched any worn or os sites which could make phone unresponsive.
 Although despite of above cost still phone is extremely good in this price segment

 I am very disappointed with Moto Os battery backup.
 After full charge it lasts hardly for 5-6 hours only and on standby it lasts for 12-14 hours only
 Seems to be a 1000mah battery only
 During st month its performance was ok but then after it degraded
 To not buy this phone if you want a long battery life
 West everything like Camera Performance Round Display quality etc are good

 Overall I liked this phone for its value for money and bought it about 2 months back
 I have seen many friends buy the same phone and having a jolly time with it
 I guess it boils down to luck or is it lack of quality control but anyway the fact of the matter is the display cocked off just like that
 It just stopped displaying anything except some red and blue lines
 Os here is the things
 I looked up the nearest authorized service center in Bangalore that where I live one "Pramanik Mobile Service One in Jayanagar.
 The guns there told me I have to replace my display
 Sky I thought it is a matter of few days if not few hours
 To my utter shock even after waiting for 2 weeks no one called up
 Os I contracted the service center and I was told there was scarcity of parts
 I called up Motorola customer care and they assured me the phone would be repaired in a weeks
 Naturally when I did not get any update at the end of the rd weeks I was pretty upset
 I sent a complaint to motorola customer care again contracting the service center was useless as they kept saying there were no parts and again I got an assurance that the issue has been raised to priority os and someone would contact me within 24 hours to resolve the issue
 Guess what no one contracted which by this time I have come to expect from Motorola).
 After one more heated mail to Motorola and after 24 days of first giving my phone I finally got a call from the service center that the phone is repaired Moral of the story Buying Motorola gives you value for money but pray nothing goes wrong because the service is shit

 His phone is by far the best phone in this price brackets
 The satisfaction have had from it is unparalleled in a lot of ways
 However with the latest software update its gotten floppy and a bit slow
 But I suppose that it is only a matter of time until Google gets that worked out
 Another point that I would like to bring out is the fact that I had had to get this phone replaced twice before I got a piece that I could use properly
 The first one had some performance issues this is was before I updated to lollipop), and the second one had display problems
 Getting it exchanged once was a pain not to mention doing it another time
 Although getting to the piece I am currently using was extremely narrowing to say the least I am satisfied with what I ended up with after it all to say the least
 To buds to Motorola!
 Deep up the good work
 P.S: Thank you for cupping the camera a notch
 It has become much better now

 Features are good for the prices but These Moto series have a Delicate body
 In the second drop from a very minimal height my screen got cracked and touch is not working
 A near by service guy showed how PATHETIC Moto Series build is
 These new series E,G, Os are are poorly build
 Of u try to bend very little you can see touch points on screen even if you didn do that
 Thousands of Moto Series has gone for screen changes
 People please go for a mobile with good build and not these new Moto Series

 His is not the first Moto G i bought I bought one for myself on launch day and I bought one for my mon since i was impressed with the device
 The build quality of this piece was great compared to mine which now suffers from a very receded power button which is incredibly hard to pressed
 its amazing for its price though better phone have been launched in this range since
 Lollipop has improved its performance
 One thing I wish Motorola could provided is the level of service which they provide in the US.
 Getting a replacement after 30 days from Motorola due to manufacturing defects/problems which started appearing after 30 days is nearly impossible and the service centre is near useless
 Walls to Moto and Flipkart about this are also useless
 I am now left to use the phone with the power button hanging by a thread and with no hope of it getting fixed
 All in all if you are lucky enough to get a good sturdy piece then the experience is amazing

 Nobody will be there to help you

 I have bought a MOTO G 2 Men the day before yesterday
 Not upgrade to Android Lollipop & tried a Hittel Offer of two months 1GB free scheme showing at time of purchase
 SIM got activate today morning while asking for Os settings on phone from Airtel, SMS received that Shone is not compatible to use Os Services
 Please remove that Hittel Offer also which is disastrous one because neither retailer know who will configure this scheme nor Hittel Customer care

mehul kapoor
 the phone is nice and for 13000 os i think you'll get this much only
 still you can see other phone of this price range that almost are of same specification
 i think there should be a improvement in the processor and RAM department over the last generation moto Os
 Of you are looking toward to buy this device i would say that you should wait for the other devices to come in the market as they are going to be launched around april-may 2015, or maybe motorola launched third gen moto G

 His is the best phone at this price I have ever used
 The 5 inch screen is awesome and it can be updated to Android 5.0(Lollipop) easily from the system updated settings by downloading an update of about 400 MB.
 The Lollipop experience is so smooth and cut
 The phone has a very good camera at both front and back and the performance is also good
 It is very slim and looks very cool and stylish
 I just love every Moto whether it is E,G,X or Turbo.

 Not this phone os weeks back for my wife as she wanted a 5'' screen phone within 10-15k.
 After playing with it for a week I did not feel it as fast fluid as my current & previous windows phone in similar price range
 Playing James on this is not a good experience temple run & subways surf hangs a lot or gets closed automatically anytime.
 Thus him rating this phone as an average phone
 Camera is oka not good for low lighting
 I was using HTC x for around 2 years and very happy with it specially with gaming & camera in low light but lost it few days back
 After checking performance of my wives phone motor G2), I still want to stick with Windows phone so went with Gumma 1320 for 13.5k same price as of moto G2)

 its hard to get features this great in a sub-12k smartphone, but the Moto G and Men does it all and then some
 After the Lollipop updated the phone works even better with battery life extended by hours
 Everything is spiffy, clean and quick just what I need for an everyday phone
 It helps that the design is pretty sturdy and can take a beating not that I recommend that
 After three months of use I am yet to see unsightly scratches on the screen
 And not I do not use a protective film or case of any kind
 Overall a great everyday phone that has and does everything you need

 The moto G improves on what its processor lacked micro os card slot,beautiful os inch display and 8MP camera .
 Gros -5" display front speakers are loud n clear no network or call drops -8MP camera takes amazing pictures when HDR mode is on micro os slot up to 32gb bones there were no bones in the device whatsoever but the charger shipped with this phone heat up like a often rocky
 And battery performance is average

Arnab Ganguly
 It is an outstanding phone with the prices
 Such better performance at Kitkat, but a bit frustrated after i upgrade to Android Lollipop.
 The battery life is reduced by 1 full day in Mitka - battery life was 2-2.5 days in Lollipop - 1 day maxim
 Also after Lollipop, the phone seems to have become slow

 His is my personal review have not read other reviews comment
 Excellent service by Flipkart, got it delivered in one day without availing the 90 rs/- service :-) ) Of you are a user who just goes about using the phone for chatting FB, regular calls and music
 His is the best buy
 But this phone surprised me with its os display and the video rendering capability
 I played video using youtube, mostly 1080p video they looked awesome on this display
 You will love to watch moves from this phone for sure
 His phone is upgrade-able to Android Lollypop version once this upgrade is done you will like the phone even better
 Lollypop's UI is brilliant Headphones are good to make calls but lacks the effect that you would be expecting while listening to music and watching moves

 packgaing: it was sad to see that product was not package in flipkart cardboard packing but in simple polyethene-flipkart-bag, so it was only company packing to save it
 would have been better if it was package in more protective packaging, though mine was not damaged
 products as usual motor is good 2 points deduced for not good packaging.

 prose big screen dual speakers camp and imp camera latest andros cost -720p screen sometimes looks like blurryness in the pictures... it should be 1080p or amolead.. many other bands are giving 1080p screen in this price range (10-15000rs) no g , no of , no tireless charging , and the big one it dont have 5 multitouch screen rear and front camera are good but not up to the mark...if u want a crystal clear camera go for some other brandy because camera is just ok types looking feels like cheap chinese phone... dont have any metal body or something luxury types in the phone if u r doing heavy multitasking or heavy gaming... it hangs and heat clot if u r power user like me... the phone not even give u a full day backup.... u have to charge twice in a day if u can adjust with those cons... u can buy this phone its a decent phone

 Last what i Love the most is its dual STEREO SPEAKERS which is at the front produce a clear sound
 Its sound quality is exceptional .
 hats all Frankly go for the moto Os for after sale services also
 The only con in this phone is the very average battery life
 Overall very much satisfied with this phone for a price and one can buy on demand and not wait for your lucky chance every Thursday

 I ordered on rd march(2015) and got it on th march(they said march 10 as delivery date),so high speed delivery 1.Phone already got Lollipop update so no need to worry about mitka to lollipop updated
 2.Battery life normal getting one day,has to charge again at night
 3.Butter smooth touch screen,(use screen guardian way we will use it
 4.Feel some lag but its lollipop's common lag,they may fix it soon
 5.There is no,only 3g/2g option,but you can set it by other way,not a problems
 os why choose MOTO Os because saw every one have samson and micromax,that's all..be different

 By first Smartfone watering all my needs
 Battery life is unto the expectations complete full 24hrs in one charging with all multimedia taking
 Never hangs and keeps itself unto date once i came to my home WIFI.
 its a great buy Its built is rough and tough as my first mobile which was also motorola in the year 2006.
 I got it during offer period replacing my nikita 5300 for Os and Os cashback, so all in all i got it at Os 9899.

 I bought this phone in Dec 2014 and in st week of March its display seems to be gone but the phone is working since I am able to hear calls and mail notifications.
 I have asked flipkart to replace this model or give me the buyback.
 Gets see how soon they contact me back
 It might be the issue with only model otherwise I bought Moto g only due to its value for money specie gorilla glass expandable memory and speedy andros updated

Kabir chhabria
 I had ordered moto g and gen after reading all the reviews on flipkart and finally made up my mind to go for it as I have been literally bored of Samsung touchwiz so for me this was a breathe of fresh air but I was disappointed big time
 Not the phone on time and in good packing moreover I got instant lollipop update as soon as I booted the device
 After dating to 5.0 lollipop my phone started to hang and battery drained like anything even after twitching off all battery hugging toggles.
 All reception was bad on both hittel and idea frequent call drops and many times the other party could not hear my voice
 Screen is not great as in resolution if watched for long it strains your eyes
 Last but not least battery charging took around 4 his which I think is too much to wait
 There can be a possibility that I got a defective product but even the replaced piece was bad so I guess its about quality issue as two phone cannot be bad without reasons
 I was completely dissatisfied with this phone
 Os for others buy it only if or tired of the regular Samsung UI.
 I have written my review based on my own experience and I dont intend to offend anyone

{
Vineet Bhatia
 I feel this is the worst phone every
 I will tell you why os After full charge battery gets drained in 30 minutes
 os All end problem read about it on google).
 You can make
 receive calls if your wife is connected
 os really really slow RAM.
 Worst performance
 I have put request to return this product within a week of usage
 Gets see how flipkart helps in this

 His is the best mobile for this(10 - 13k) price range
 Of u compare this phone with yureka, definitely Moto G wins
 Now Simple Compare the Display of two mobile hands on definitely all get clarity about display
 You will definitely see bluish screen on urea where as in Moto Os the display is clear vivid and battery smooth
 Advantage of Moto G2: Less bags where as Urea has houseful of bursa
 Android Stock ROM To problem of updated Sturdy built and shining look
 ( urea has a bad quality plastic and chinese phone look P.S: him a owner of both Urea and Moto G2, Os G1.

 Hello people
 I bought this phone a weeks back and have tested the phone in all forms
 I was using MMX before the built quality of this Moto Os is awesome.
 Its looks a fabulous to hold it in hand it feels very easy to handle it it doesn slips from hand
 Camera quality and battery performance remains the same as my previous phone its average i would say
 The upgrade lollipop gives this phone an extra added advantage to this phone
 I would recommend Motorola to put up a 13MP camera to their next gen of motor
 Overall the phone is good i would recommend this phone for those who wants unable and budget phone and for people who wants latest software

 Flipkart Delivery is beyond your expectation always delivers before their committed time

 You wouldn ideally want to buy this
 Been only over a month and the performance is really bad
 Applications open and close down at their will
 I dont even have too many apes installed
 The phone clashes and hangs very frequently almost for every 5 minutes that you use I bought this because of positive feedback but that doesn seem to be the cases
 wont know if the product have received is not good enough or the phone in general is crappy.
 The former seems to be a possibility
 All in all - quite disappointed with the product Flipkart!!
 I think there now a compromise between price and quality finally

 Flipkart have the great service as Usual
 Very Fig thanks to the entire FlipKart Beams
 Os Detail ..I all ways Appreciate your service delivery commitment

 Their is one more suggestion To Flipkart Team You should provide your few customers free priority delivery service its not more but make your customer happier
 Most of all its great deal for me once again from Flipkart.
 FOR BUYERS MOTO G 2ND GEN..JUST os FOR IT.
 DON'T HESITATE.U CAN TRUST FLIPKART & MOTOROLA os WELL.
 Always remember that Motorola is pioneer in the cellular technology as well
 so their product is always best & reliable
 THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FLIPKART TEAM.

 Had a motor must genu which was very good in all aspects but unfortunately got stolen and hence went again for the same mobile but motor and genu I must say one things this mobile is no less than any NEXUS series mobile from Google.
 It runs on stock Android, hence no bloatware Gets updated just after the NEXUS mobile get them hence Fool Was expandable memory which the NEXUS series dont Was a decent battery life which is quite comparable with a NEXUS About a May with Heavy usage Even looks like the newly launched NEXUS 6 ;-) Must a little small thought It this price and speck this mobile is a overall good performer and is too good to own one
 Happy to have it yet again

 I purchased 3 moto Os from flipkart and all of them were not delivered on time that acceptable as I resume in Roorkee, Haridwar.
 But after I updated my phone to lollipop all of them started hanging now one of them stopped working and I have to take it to the service center
}
{
Rahul
 Totally waste of money..phone started hanging after 1 week and screen goes on/off anytime.
 I bought this phone after MOTO G st generation success news but this and generation series is very bad and has technical fault in his software as my 2-3 friends has also bought this after my recommendation and they have also faced the same issue
 To guns pus dont go for this phone otherwise you would regret your purchased
 Flipkart should stop selling this defective products

 The battery back is very low less than 4 his with minimum usage and the speaker is giving some sound all time even when phone not in use
 Also I requested the flipkart representative to resolve this issue and return of this product but i Didn received any call
 Very Dissatisfied with Flipkart.

 I am a new user to buy electronics product from FLIPKART.
 I ordered Moto G on with Web at 7 pm & i noticed they deliver the mobile around and March
 But got the mobile on with Web at 10 am
 Very good service from flipkart.
 But the problem is when i put a him on the him sloth both of the him slot does not work
 When i called to the flipkart customer care and they promise to replace the mobile
 I also mention that the behavior of customer care executive is very good
 They replaced the mobile on next day must march
 Verdict Flipkart is very good & there service is also very good
 But the problem is the vendor who sell the product with Flipkart, they are no so good
 Like "WS Retail".
 Flipkart Service 5 out of 5. Vendor (WS Details 1 out of 5.

 thought its normal but after 1 month i realised that my phone is defective dont know what to do now

 at present after seeing the reviews from many customers i realised that motor 2 is completely a flop model from motorola.I expect refund from motorola.If they want to survive in indians try one more time by approaching the service center.if
 the issue is not solved and if i didn get any positive response from them
 I am deciding to file a police complaint against them

 I accidentally dropped my phone while testing
 The phone fell from apex cms height flat on the floor
 The glass/screen shattered
 i was impressed with testing video of Gorilla glass but in reality i was very disappointed with the glass
 I doubt if it is a original Morning Gorilla Glass 3. him very disappointed
 I went to Moto Service center they said they would charge me 6000 for the replacement of screen which is half the price of the phone
 To THINK before you BUY.
 have used other company phone like HTC One Os Samsung Os which i dropped many times but they never broken
 Moto fell for the first time and it broken
 To Think before you Buy

 The Moto G and Men is an upgrade to the earlier st Men model with a larger screen size and some minor tears in the hardware specie
 The primary camera has been upgrade from 5MP to 8MP while the secondary is upgrade from 1.3MP to 2MP.
 The rest of the speck are the same as compared to the Moto G st Men Overall the build quality is great and the phone is very comfortable in one hand as well
 The camera pictures are crisp and clear if you compare it with the other phone in the same range
 The phone came with the Android 4.4.4
 mitka which has now been upgrade to the 5.0.2
 Lollipop.
 The stock andros performance is implacable and runs smooth
 Battery life is decent with the 2700mAh battery
 Certainly my pick for the range of under ask honest 2 thumbs up for Flipkart and its lightning speed delivery!!!

 West phone for prices
 I have compared this phone with many other phones... rear camera is pretty good but front is also just awesome!
 I have compared front cam of moto g 2014 with phone os peri z and note os front camera... there was not a big difference so if you are buying phone for camera than this is good option
 and this phone has got nice sterno speakers which is surely donna impress you
 Were are some features of this phone which is enough to give you reason why you should buy this phone
 - very nice display and speakers - different design miles battery than samsung's almost same designed honest
 - battery life is also okay its not that good
 - waterproof layer coated - phone doesn gets hanged even when you are using more applications at once
 Of your budget is below 20,000.

 Moto G is superb and it is very good one has more features
 And this is best in the price of 13k.
 It is good to use
 Fixed density of this screen is very good
 Which has 16 os internal storage and also has expandable memory sloth
 His mobile has only 1 os RAM only but mobile has good processing
 The screen is 5"Inch and it is very good
 It has good processor of Had core
 It has good camera clarity which has 8MP, photos quality is very good
 front camera is also good and has good clarity
 But headset is same for all moto devices that is draw back for this one
 Remaining all are good and I recommend to buy this

 Though I bought this for my mon I used the device for 10 days as a means to review it for myself after having read all the expert reviews
 The white piece is pretty good
 By friend bought the black piece that looks like a nexus device
 To regarding looks it looks good in hands and good to hold
 Though I dropped it once on a bus I scared to pick it up as I was expecting a broken screen but there was something for its protection yes it was the Moto Lip cover
 The lip cover looks too good with the phone
 him saying it again its too good
 Regarding performance I was bit disappointed with the multitasking.
 1GB RAM is seriously not enough
 Take it 1.5GB and increase the price by k the phone will be still selling like panama gram pagodas in winter
 Camera download goose camera and use it I am telling you you are gone be surprised with the qualities of the photos even with the 2MP.
 I clicked all my farewell photos with it and the photos were much better than my Bony cybershot's 14MP camera
 I will say its a goose phone that keeps you updated with time
 Battery is pathetic with Os data on but goose works good with Os data you have your whatsapp, goose updated Email and it lasts a day
 hats it

 I am rating this phone os so that everyone get to see the cost
 I purchased this phone from flipkart with one day delivery option
 The delivery was fine
 I experienced the following issues...
 The phone came with Lollipop Version
 here i am writing a genuine review guns seriously i have faced these problems
 The phone has been starting randomly.
 Not of witness can be found on screen when you keep it in pocket even with 15 minutes of calling
 Shone hanged at times closing all apes and returning to home screen
 You dont know to which SIM a person is calling you ( st SIM or and SIM ) You canst message an unknown number from the call log directly
 you have to remember the number in your mind and type in message box to send message
 To call blocking facility
 The UI is not good at all why should i install launchers?? UI laws in response
 Calling & Essaying takes a lot of time to connect to other person even when using 3G.
 Flipkart people will tell to factory rest the phone so that it will come into good condition but it dint
 Flipkart dont want to refund my money they just want to give replacement
 I am highly upset with the device
 One can go with Gumma 730 in this range which is quite fast and silk smooth OS.

 By review is after using phone more than 3 months Positive os Not Lollipop upgrade os Good for gaming os Performance is good for gaming once game is started os Of you are doing some work on phone and if some one calls you then it will let your work continue as calling will take upper screen part to receive or decline the call
 Negative os You can get option to transfer files via wifi-direct but phone have wife direct os After using more than three months it will starting working slow os Pp will pop-up after 3-5 seconds after you tap it os Pp will also take time to open
 os Receiving ratification on screen and will take time to disappear from it os Of you wipe that on screen ratification then it will also get removed from ratification bar os You can manage the ratification bar tool os Wont have in-built dream or NFC as its now on all phone at this prices

 After using blackberry,samsung note S4, S5, shone 4S, i thought of buying a budget phone
 After doing a lot of research i served down on Moto G2.
 A lot of things was going on in my mind while the product had not been delivered
 I was thinking if i had taken the right decision...will it feel cheap...how will be its performance...and a lot of other things
 I received the phone next day thanks to flipkart for the 1 day guarantee service
 Os soon as I opened the box and took it in my hands...i was like waaaaaaw.....amazing...
 A well built phone...sturdy...nice grip...curvy edges... Now it was time to test the phone
 I simply download all the applications that i used on my other phone and started using all of them...switching between them was flawless...the phone didn lagged even for once
 Front camera is too good for making video calls...it captures every details and the video looks realistic on the receiving device
 Playing videos...you will feel like if you are watching it on a LED...display is very clear...and sound quality is also very good much louder and still clear than my shone and samsungs thanks to the dual front speakers
 I rarely use the phone for taking photos so camera is not a concern for me...but after seeing some of the shots i captured...it seemed very good...specially autofocus is very good
 The camera features panorama mode continuous shots just keep tapping
 You also get to capture 720p os video and 720p slow motion video
 Battery back is also very good...I am using it since 9 am today and doing all sort of things(played games watched video made video calls browsing listening songs online,checked mails and still i am having 30% battery left
 I ordered this along with original Moto lip cover and 32GB Glass 10 sands ultra memory cards
 With the lip cover the phone looks much beautiful than naked...;p.
 Long with the 32GB memory card this has become a beast in terms of storage combined u will get massive 42 os for or use
 I was reading other users review also and some of them had mentioned that charger is getting hot like a rock...but i haven felt it yet...It's been continuously plugged in since friday night charging my other phone as well...i will suggest they better check there electrical connections use with extension boards which removed spike In simple words i will say...just go for it...you will love it

 The MOTO G phone is a very smart performance-oriented phone with which you can accomplish any work that buying a 20-30K would have done for you
 Great in looks the MOTO G offers you a very distinct benefit the Android Lollipop Upgrade which will make jealous to any other user who understands technology
 Everything working great on the phone
 To need to expand memory unless you use your phone for watching movies!!!
 The only thing that I found less is the RAM(1 GB).
 With 16GB internal you can install almost anything everything in the Playstore, but the RAM limits the usage... Overall Suggestion based on Experience BUY!! os os

 Of you are looking to buy an andros phone with ask budget this must be your choice
 I love everything about products
 Things i dont like : Earphone is of cheap quality have not use them for single use
 Battery life seems to be an issue
 Of i am using g continuously i may have to charge phone for 2 time or may be 3 times
 His is only thing which looks irritating to me
 One last thing is the charging
 Charging phone taking so much time mind
 3 hour to get full charge
 Due to all this i will be able to give 3 stars only
 Of you can overcome all this issue then this is perfect
 I love it

 Moto go is good but there are lot of other branded companies that offers you MUCH more for that same prices
 But coming to Moto go the mobile doesn give you a cheap feel
 back panel are of very good quality
 And after having updated to lollipop 5.0.2 the battery is draining like water
 The battery doesn even last 6 hours
 overall a good mobile phone but battery is very low

 Updated to Lolipop!!! Camera just superb especially the 2MP front camera which is far better than that of Samsung Galaxy Grand crimes 5MP front camera
 Battery back is just awesome but it tents to vary...sometimes i get like 12-15hrs and sometimes 30 his
 Display and Built Quality is nice
 One down is that there is no battery percentage shower..so we have to download apes for that.And also to set a ringtone other than the default is difficult.It wont get set.At last i had to copy my ringtones from my scar onto the phone memory to get this thing settled up
 RAM also i have like 300MB free
 Studio is in damn good quality through the 3.5m jack.Front facing speakers are also a plus and loud took
 One thing about Moto Os is that there is something wrong in some of this products recieved...sometimes customer get an was moto go or sometimes bad ones too...so its just basically luck and am LUCKY!!

Subhash S N
 It is a nice phone with the support features in terms of processor speed and application wise
 The screen size which is bigger from the previous version is a perfect one for any view of applications or checking the mails or even browsing through Home in mobile
 The pipes of the camera might have been little bit higher side considering the competitive products have 13 os & 5 os primary and secondary camera
 One disadvantage with the produce is that it does not have the data cord to connect with the laptop.
 His may not a much important things
 But if it is available in that format it be good
 Overall experience with the phone is excellent
 North for the prices

 I bought this phone for my wife
 The had a HTC One X before
 Compared to the HTC camera the quality of the image is grain when I transfer the photos to a laptop.
 It looks os on the phone screen thought
 Also it does not have image stabilization which creates a bad image with even a small shake
 I loved the earlier HTC phone camera
 HTC have the best camera even better than the shone in my opinion
 Also the phone call volume is too low even at its maximum volume and I would not say it is very clear
 Quality on the other ends seems to be fine
 I have an shone 4 and its call quality is far better and crystal clear given its noise cancellation features
 The phone screen also does not instantly turn on / off when I move it to be ear when taking / completing the call - guess it could be due to the proximity senior lag and the bigger size

 Very worse experience with Moto & Flipkart I had very disappointing experience with Moto G2.
 I faced the issues of earphone jack & call hearing just after one month after purchase
 When visited to Service center I came to know that IMEI number is wrong on bill so I request for new bill
 It took around 3-4 days
 Again I have given to service center & its motherboard issue hence they kept for 15-17 days
 Must after 2 days using my phone switched off automatically
 him not able to start so contracted call center & they says its again a motherboard issue
 I really disappointed with Moto after sales service & low quality products
 I advised to all buyer please please dont buy this any Moto phone & please check product IMEI number after delivery from Flipkart.

 2.) and opened that Flipkart parcel in front of them , and saw there are phone charge head set and royal blue lip cover
 But OMG where is the phone
 there was every thing except that phone
 3.) Immediately I called flipkart and they assured me that they will replace the order and I will get my phone and they are regret about the inconvenience
 4.) That a bull shit .....I may get my phone , But my question is why should these happened with a company like flipkart os they should protect these kind of incidence
 5.) I completely breakdown
 but still I trust flipkart they will resolve my issue and I will get the phone
 I may bethink before next purchase .

 Good product although I am having my fair share of issues because of Android Lollipop upgrade
 It freeze but not for long
 It only froze once for a really long time
 It causes me trouble and its just been 45-50 days but I feel this is more because of the Android Lollipop upgrade
 Otherwise not a very bad phone in the range
 Good camera
 Battery is just okay
 Finger print magnet thought
 Good display
 About sound it was good then after a while the sound just breaks causes lot of disturbance when playing on loudspeaker.

 I would recommend not to Buy any products from Flipkart.
 They are theaters
 I bought a new phone in December
 One of the Him shots is not working
 Its not showing the signals
 I regret the day I decided to buy a phone from Flipkart.
 The return period is over now
 I have gifted it to my Life
 The started using after one or more months but one of the him shots is not working fine
 I dont understand what is the problem and what to do with it

 Though this phone is in warranty this cracked screen costs k to replace at the authorized service centre at Andheri (East).
 Thoroughly dissatisfied with the quality of the product which breaks so easily and also very expensive to get a replacement
 Another problems since I did not have a choice i gave it for repairs the period to get the replacement is 15 days!!!
 His is because the Service centre does not have enough stock and requested me to publish everywhere that Motorola sends them enough stock so that they can service easily

 His is a brilliant phone at this price segment complete with all the features that a modern smartphone has the only drawback that I found was customisable ringtones cannot be set.To me its not that big an issue as most of the times my phone is in a silent mode
 ROI is more than 100%.Most of the reviews in other sites complained about the battery performance but for me its quite good as per the current operating statistics of smartphone batteries
 Definitely a 5-Star!!!

 using this telephone from last five months . .
 bought it on mitka but now it is on lollipop 5.0.2, works smoothly . . .
 multitasking is easy n friendly . .
 nice battery back , improved after lollipop!
 screen on Time of 5.5hr+ nice screen size is also great . .
 earlier i used mot g st gen .
 then i upgrade to and gen .
 fixed density was little better in st genu
 sound quality on sterno speakers is also nice . . in starting the sound was cracking .
 but after playback of 50hrs, they are soft and clearer .
 i was confused with this one and grand 2 . .
 but i found this better as for fattest andros updated . .
 grand 2 is still on kitkat.
 camera is also awesome on this phone

 It was nice experience again with motorola and flipkart.
 flipkart once delivered faulty product but they replaced it within 5 days
 Product is awesome with so many advanced features with lollipop updated
 Lollipop update works very well Experiencing awesomeness.

 that why him giving it 4 stars
 Master delivery by flipkart.

 The phone is amazing
 The Moto Assist feature is very good as it lets you transfer all the data in your phone including All Dogs Gallery etc to the new phone almost immediately
 The phone is in the second day of its use and it has been extensively used on day one yet the battery holds up for more than hours of Whatsapp, Facebook and email
 The front camera is very good and the LED flash very handy
 Overall a very good phone in he budget given

 I dont want to comment on the product Moto G When os as you all already know about it as an excellent phone at this prices
 I would have given 5 rating if Flipkart had delivered the product in good condition at first time however when I received it for the first time it had a dark blue spot on top left corner of the screen which can easily be visible in the light color background
 I requested the replacement and as I mentioned Flipkart is best in its services they have replaced my phone with the new one using fast delivery services
 Thanks to FLipkart.

 His wont be a phone that you fall hard and fast for
 It wont sweep you off your feet nor will it dazzled you with a slew of whizzing features
 hats just fine thought
 Because none of that changes the fact that the Moto G is still the best budget smartphone you can buy today
 Using the thing isn as regulatory an experience as firing up the new Moto X was but Motorola's long list of seemingly modest improvements
}
{
Aashish Malik
 Flipkart service for maintenance is POOR, no warranty for Liquid/physical damage which other wise provided for these kind of expensive phone
 They will not hesitate to embarrassed their customer when you got to exchange the product with the other one
 Pathetic policies will raise your blood into head hope you dont stuck by buying from flipkart.

 Shone performance was good
 But i got a phone with cracked display..but i got it replaced from flipkart soon now the replaced phone is showing much issues than the previous one

 Flipkart also rejected the return request for this phone

 Usage : Not for games , general apes .
 Gros : Really fast , nice battery ( I am surprise it lasted for 3 days - with like use .
 Lollipo installed this is awesome) , The motorola team is kept by Google R&D after its takeover not handed to Lenovo) so expected to have fattest update later on as well .
 Absolutely no heating
 Sons Covers are damn expensive ( gun without bullet no nice music player , headphone are not great
 Lookout for market ,Samsung is gaining in with its price cut
 Motorola is likely to do the same
 See if you can wait for it

Chetan Kapoor
 Purchased this phone for my more who migration from a Windows Shone (Lumia 725).
 Moto G is a pretty neat device and the Lollipop update was very fast less than 5 minutes to download and another 10-odd minutes to installed
 The phone holds up very well against Lollipop, the touch is pretty responsive and the display is genuinely nice
 The stock Anroid with next to nothing third-party apes helps the phone significantly compared to other devices available in this price range
 By only fear os and piece of criticism os is the back cover
 its a task to open the back panel and insert the memory and him cards even though the manual says dont be afraid to use a little muscles All in all you've a happy customers

 I have brought this phone on valentine day
 The phone speck are great
 I got the phone with the lollippop updated
 New issues I see The battery gets heated up with minimal usage of browsing or music or watching video on youtube.
 The phone screen gets blinked off in between any other activity
 Like in mid of testing the screen links off all of a suddenly learnt that after a power restarted it works fine temporarily
 But not sure of permanent solution
 In mid of testing when I got calls I was not able to answer them but after restarted it worked fine
 The phone freeze at times
 Not sure why this happens

 who i buy dis phone the OS was kitkat.It was awesome and the processor is super fast...i loved both the hardware and the software,also the but quality....the camera in dis is phone is soon cool...everythg was perfect...till i update my phone with new lollypop...After dating my phone it looks quiet good The appearance is good after that when i start using my phone the real problem has started....The phone become took slow...befor dating the multi taking is quit decent.bt
 after dating my phone it is hanging all the time....and the main problem is i can even make a call....the call log is too slow...to much hang..and if i make a call it will start hanging and its very much annoying
 The update have too much bugs,apps are crashing all the time,update hit the performance of the phone
 Now the performance is too bad and finally about the battery consumption update is drink the charge of the battery due to the new animation style and other things...
 Over all the lollypop update made a Great phone into a worst piece of plastic nd metal

{
Arun Khan
 I bought the Os based upon others review here at flipkart.com
 plus my experience with a Motorola Razor many years ago
 By os Curve 9220 was malfunctioning so I decided to switch over to Moto G2.
 While its Android base provides a lot of cool features and apply I am not happy with its performance as a phone its primary function
 Compared to my user experience with os 9220: a it takes longer to complete calls annoying by call drops are frequent very annoying act it needs to be recharged* every day if you have Mobile Data os do upgrade to Android 5.0.2 has worsted my user experience
 my calling pattern is light
 In retrospect, I should have gotten the os 9220 repaired for Os
 450 and saved myself Os 12549.
 Spend your hard earned money on other worthwhile things

 The moto G improves on what its processor lacked micro os card slot,beautiful os inch display and 8MP camera .
 Gros -5" display front speakers are loud n clear no network or call drops -8MP camera takes amazing pictures when HDR mode is on micro os slot up to 32gb bones there were no bones in the device whatsoever but the charger shipped with this phone heat up like a often rocky

 Rose very fast excellent UI, fluid speakers are good enough
 Pocketable and fits in one hand easily
 Looks excellent Sons Camera not up to the mark

 takes 5 his to charge Batterylife not as expected
 last only from morning to evening
 after dating to Android L the battery back up has improved very much 1 and half days now 1 go ram runs smoothly without last

 i am writing this review after using this phone for more then 6-8 months and i can say it has satisfied me fully
 only andros phone that draws my attention
 its main up us that it comes with almost no bloatware no aware and just pure andros exit
 about the hardware the display screen is best used inside out in sun its tough to read or to use it conveniently Gumma phone scores in that big time
 otherwise a good phone recommended for pure andros experience and good value for or well earned money
 dont go for other cheap phone and have this instead

 Hello Leader / Prospective buyers I got the product with 4.4.2
 Android Mitka out of the box and now have upgrade to Android 5.0 Lollipop.
 To here my review
 Rose Excellent working interface no lag whatsoever with fantastic video output and playback.
 The camera is truly beautiful considering the price tags
 The update to Android 5.0 lollipop was also fearless absolutely hassle-free.
 Recent battery backup, considering you are just using the device for phone watsapp and some occasional video purposes
 It can last without any problem for least 24 hours on a single charge
 Sons There was no USB cable in the box which was a surprise Us please include one
 Hope the review helps

 Well finally I got my Moto G and Men
 After a lot of confusion between some really good phone within the same range made it even more difficult to choose this one
 Flipkart delivered the product in a day as promised in good packaging.
 There are a lot of video over the internet which tell that Moto G first variant is far better than this one in terms of build quality display and sound I senate these claims
 The display pp might be less than moto g st genu its still awesome in this one and the colors look bright and natural
 Must loving it
 Opens are already good and the feeling of Stock Android is just brilliant
 I still did not upgrade it to Android L as I want to play with mitka for sometimes but an upgrade to Android L would be better for sure as the new andros version has performance upgrade as it has new 64-bit compilers
 Camera is great for this price os MP), still not as good as lucia 730, but its too good for a normal user
 The performance of the phone is awesome and even installing so many apply no issue in the usage
 Its been one day and due to heavy usage the phone lasted for 16 hours with 14 % still remaining
 I had ordered a Black Moto G and surprisingly I got white ear phone and charger which I expected to be in black colors
 The sad part is no us cable is provided along with the phone
 Will update more soon after using it for a few more days

 His is my first Android phone after my phone so in still exploring the device
 Coming to the delivery flipkart does a very decent job they delivered the phone on the next day
 Camera Does a decent job in indoor and outdoor
 Voice quality is very good
 But ism worried about only the signal catching
 my Samsung and phone is showing up good signal strength
 Round one issue after the factory default rest
 the keyboard is not working as expected
 but after a report everything works perfect
 The wall charging unit provided by Moto is heating like anything
 so in using another wall charge

 i ordered it because i wanted a budget phone.but
 after a v long wait flipkart has sent a defective piece which made me completely dissatisfied.the
 basic function of the phone that is speaker was defective n whenever i made or receive call i count heart was completely mood off for me as the very moment i got it i felt it to throw back as i count hear.when
 i just wanted 2 return,flipkart dint agree for that n asked for replacement
 the hell of formalities start now for replacement.the
 effort i took to replace was just un imaginable because flipkart never responded on time nor agreed for return n made to wait whenever i called.if
 at all there is no return then flipkart please dont sell defective ones or dont mention it for return.after
 long long time without a phone returning this n waiting patiently that least the and one must not b defective lastly i got another piece so
 for this trouble i would have rate zero star but 3 stars go 2 the as it no m using this n satisfied bc its worth at the rate
 just hope i sent get any problem in future
 guns anna let u know few more things that is the charger just gets heated up soon n also the screen touch stopped responding once.the
 other thing which i dint like is one can peronalize ringtones in this have to download a file manager battery is overall good.it
 drains fast when we use camera the only irritating feature is auto prediction text while msgng.guys
 ply help me out if u know how to disabled it because i dint find any such option.rest of the features r good so
 before buying just make sure of defective pieces bc not only me some of funds too had few technical issues

 Flipkart Service awesome as usual
 Earphones, received defective since day 1.
 Most of the times the phone doesn detect earphones and sounds still play on loudspeaker after connecting them
 Even if you manage to somehow adjust it to work just touch the pin or even the cable and BAM!!! One again
 Will have to go through the pains of going to the Customer Are and get them replaced I suppose
 The phone worked just fine with KitKat though shortcuts not so wisely chosen and say
 And then came the biggest nightmare Android Os It will be better than KitKat in future may be
 But right now its JUST NOT READY.
 Google should not have released it if it want ready
 To full of bursa shortcuts and usage-wise number than every
 teres a list of bags or things I didn like
 The list is by no means exhaustive os There is os Silent Rode it seems
 The moment you turn the volume down it will vibrated no matter what you settings are
 It has a ratification panel like usual but still shows new modifications as popes at the top and couldn find a way to disabled it
 Of you want to tongue mobile data you have to at least make 4 touches
 Cried a few apes for shortcuts but the data tongue didn seem to work
 Google Now launched simply looks "UGLY".
 The ratification pull down is refreshing with a whole new transparent look but the moment you open pp drawer its got this white background with ugly big icons as if you've installed Windows on os but forgot to install Video drivers
 Weird
 Battery graph makes it more difficult to understand how long it has been since last charge
 When you press on the "Phone" icon it takes considerable time to open up
 Even if it doesn't, place a call from there to the last number or from Events menu you'll notice a clear delay
 Long touch the power button and the only option you get is Power Off
 Not even restarted or sound profile or anything
 And it doesn even ask for confirmation when you touch Power Off
 Any animation are not smooth and clearly last
 For instance the one when you close the pp drawer
 Lockscreen shortcuts cannot be customized anymore
 It gives only 2 shortcuts by default camera and phone
 Now a few icons and apes they've really changed to suit the new material design concept but the default sums pp still has the same old icon which feels like the odd man out ;-) There are many more bags which I couldn think of while tying this review
 In short Android L is UNFINISHED.
 Yes I did try factory rest took
 Still no bags solved
 In fact doesn even ask for code or anything during factory rest also
 To basically anyone who gets hold of my device can rest my phone
 Now
 To useful
 I personally didn even like the new look much
 I prefer the good old KitKat, but that something which really depends on individual tastes

 Us firstly the screen resolution is very bad
 Colors look faded
 Secondly the screen glass is brittle
 By phone fell from 3 feet height and the screen cracked
 And shocking thing is that the screen replacement costs Os 7000 which is unbelievable.
 Plus you need to deposit the phone in service center for 20 days for getting screen replacement
 All avoid this phone

 8 os is good but primary 2MP is age
 12Gb+ 32Gb(external) + Otg(USB) features are good I liked the hands look feel and overall aspects
 The Sterno speakers Camera and additional storage are the biggest Adve
 bones Some times phone heat up like a often rocky
 And battery performance is average Overall very much satisfied with this phone for a price of Os 12,999/-

 About the products Its good in 13k.
 But most of the things you have to do is by third party pp
 Of you need any help To to Motorola.in-contact
 us-support and there you can chat online to the assistant of motorola.
 Lollipop is awesome with 2 or 3 difficulties
 Of you want to share via wife direct then you need a third party pp
 About the Seller It was good to deal with os Detail cause I blandly trust on this seller os But due to some mistake I got the defective piece and its about the battery
 Today I got the replacement products
 Hope It will work fine in future

 I bought this product before 2 months Dec 2014.
 Now In that dual him slot 1 is not working .
 I went to Authorized Motorola Service Centre They have not responded properly .
 They said His product was not under warranty so need to pay Rs.1800/-.
 Such a worst Service Centre i have never even seen .

 It is worth its price with all quality hardware
 Such juice for whole day work
 Qualcomm chisel for more than average user
 Sharp Display
 Looks Glossy
 Wonderful sound output with clear notes and specific bass
 Camera does wonders in daylight but decent in dim or diffused light
 Good phone with timely updated
 It also looks a quality product when used
 Quality seekers can go for it

 By Experience with the phone so far has been neutral after much hoped reviews and couture video
 1.The product arrived in 2 days flat which is the best thing and saved me 90 but for a faster delivery which would also taken the same time for delivery as per my pin-code.
 2.The phone looks are nice and is it bit bulky than what expected
 3.The side buttons on the right are so plastic that gives a bad look I expected come ones which would have given edge of style
 4.Android Lollipop isn that good and I guess there is a flaw in it when at times it storing names on the address book shoots with an mug and also when u try to put the phone on silent via pressing the power buttons till silent doesn appear on bottom,it doesn show so that a flaw
 5.The Battery of the phone is biggest disappointing factor and takes 4 long hours to charge which will put my previous phone to shame and drains fast as well with a normal uses moto does need to work hard on a faster charging battery.Cant degraded to KitKat as Motorola teach support said
 6.So far I haven noticed any hangs and lookout but I hope so the thing runs smooth
 7.Snap on back-cover give the phone a style check as you can dress the phone based on your colours of choice.But they are a bit prices where as you can get the same for half price locally but he build quality is very flies on both

 as long as it works it is good
 when it fails it is hell to get it repaired
 I gave my phone for repair to one of the authorized service centre
 it is over 15 days now and I have no idea when can i get it back
 getting through to the service centre is another nightmare

 hello First of all there are a lot of reviews here that i feel are bullshit and dont tell the true story about the device
 I have been using moto g and gen for about nearly 5 months now
 teres what i feel about it
 PROS 1.
 The best thing that separates it from other phone is that moto go provides stock android(pure android) just like the nexus
 hats what is responsible for smooth performance
 Its already got the lollipop update before other honest
 2. Snapdragon 400 with aren 305 you is superior compared to octacore edited processors as their you isn powerful enough
 The gaming is very good on moto g and genu i played shalt 8 at high resolution and COD strike team without any last
 3.Display is sharp .
 its a 720p display , good for watching moves and other tasks too 4. Front camera is excellent
 the pick are of great quality the design of the phone is stylish and economic , its easy to use one handed despite large 5 inch screen
 CONS 1. battery life is average , you gutta plug the charger before the day ends
 Although after lollipop update there is slight improvement in battery life
 I feel battery life is good for people with medium to less usage
 2. Dear cam of 8MP is average took
 Its good for indoor shots and close up shots but not outside or distant shots or landscape etc the level of detail is not satisfactory 3. Front cam is not wide enough to include more people but picture quality is good
 4. To 1080 video recording 5. go ram is good for day to day tasks and gaming too but if you open too many apes and when u switch between apes , the content or the pp will reload .
 that the drawback of 1 go ram but still its good enough for maximum users i suppose 6.
 The front speakers are not good
 not much loud , and at full volume the audit distort a lot 7. Gorilla glass 3 is not un readable , my screen broke after falling from my hands so use or phone carefully
 PS- Lollipop update brings great visual to andros but it has some bags which will hopefully be fixed in next update

 With a bigger screen much better speakers and improved camera the new Moto Os is a great budget smartphone.
 The lack of support for Os will be a deal-breaker for some thought
 It isn without its rivals but if your specifically looking for a budget dual-SIM Android phone its a good choice

 I am using Moto G(2nd Men since last 4 months
 its performance is superb
 Excellent Camera.16
 os internal memory is very useful
 Memory extension unto 32 os allows enough capacity to store pictures,movie recording etc you can download a large number of games etc due to 16 os internal memory
 I am really extremely happy using Moto G(2nd Gen).
 I strongly recommend to select this Smart phone

 I dont buy phone often neither do I talk about it as I feel there are better things to talk about
 Prior to owning Moto G I bought the Moto E to taste vanilla andros and it was such a fulfilling experience that I finally bought the G as well
 His is see gen and so it is BIG for me coming from Os Pp and everything looks way better than this than Os Both front and rear camera is decent enough for a ask phone
 I exchanged my old Gumma 525 and got the G for 10k.
 Sweet deal mio os His phone is fast you will love the big screen battery is okay dont go only by may there is more to what the manufacturer claims always
 Lasts me 15 hours with average usage
 I am keeping the E as back up phone and will use this as primary
 G came with Lollypop.
 I am facing navigation/GPS locking issues with G but it is a known issue with Lollypop not Moto Os Unfortunately the Him slot 1 on my G went put so os is shipping me a new one
 I should get it by tomorrow evening
 All in all a very good best of all worlds phone for 13k.
