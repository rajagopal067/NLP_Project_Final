 I wanted to provide a quick review for the Moto G and Men Specific model is the os GSM Black 8gb.
 I purchased this for my wife here on Amazon
 He use AT&T and I wanted to replace my wife raging iPhone4 off contract
 His is the best phone for the price I found
 I charged the phone inserted her AT&T him card from her iphone4, inserted the 16gb micro sd card can use up to 32gb), and everything worked flawlessly.Pros: lovely os screen quick and responsive touch perfect size screen Gorilla Glass micro-usb charging (common), stock Android It At upgradeable to Android L when released MicroSD card sloth front sterno speakers great call quality great reception prices unlocked great for travel no contract
 Blutooth and If work fine
 To issues connecting to our home network and my wife work wifi.Cons: To 4GLTE, On Removable battery To included headset/ear buds LIMITED accessories so far(cases)Build Quality Nothing to complain about
 Perfect weight feels solid very tight does NOT feel flimsy.
 The back phone cover is easily swappable.
 The black color is a deep matter black
 Not slippery hard plastic but a more rubberized feel.Battery life is very good
 Not stellate but easily lasts a complete day for my wife who is a average smartphone user
 I just wish the battery was replaceable to increase longevity of the phone.This phone is perfect for the non-power user average user someone new to android, or is replacing their phone off contract
 The speck are slightly above average for a phone in this price category
 It is an amazing phone for under $200 off contract
 Os LTE would have been greatly appreciated but it is not necessary because my wife phone 4 never had it either and she is almost always connected to wife anyways).I personally use the flagship os Os on AT&T another AMAZING phone
 so I set everything up for my wife (iphone4 user
 I imported her contact from her phone which was simple after watching a few couture video on how to do it
 Must search on couture "iPhone to Android Contact listen
 The entire process after watching the video took 2 minutes old
 Of course this phone cannot compare to my os G3, BUT, I was very impressed with this motor and Gen.Contents: Box Manuals, phone and charging cable with plug
 It is a wall plug with long microusb cable attached to the plug itself
 Basically the wall plug adapted and the microusb cable cannot be separated
 It is built as one single unit.NOTE* Of you live in the UNITED STATES, buy the os GSM version
 The Global version will work fine.... BUT the os GSM version is better suited for os cellular signals
 I can confirm this phone works perfectly with AT&T and should work perfectly with T-mobile.I would order this phone again in a heartfelt for my wife
 The loves it
 I hope this review helps!****Minor Update****This phone continues to impress me
 The screen is very bright and the colors are vivid and punch
 The screen resolution is more than adequate it is very similar to the phone 4 retina display
 Of you look closely you can barely see pixels.
 wont worry the screen is very sharp and small text can be read with ease.After playing with the phone for over 12 hours installing apply configuring the phone browsing the web facebook, spotify, etc
 I still show 30% battery remaining from a full charge this morning
 His was an intensive day of usage setting everything up
 I easily download 20+ apply and probably 100 songs on spotify.,Do
 not be concerned about the lack of dual simon
 Unless you are a frequent traveler going overseas this is not an important features
 Dual him is used so that when traveling you can buy a foreign him card and insert it into your phone without needing to remove your primary him card hence dual simon
 With this single him os GSM model just remove your him and swap it out for the foreign him cards no big deal
 Must dont lose your primary him card lol.*********************

 Edit 9/18/14: fixed error about SIM cards and wife specsAlso, here is a useful link to information about os card usage in android: https://forums.motorola.com/posts/7e59cc7bafEdit
 9/21/14: Yesterday I used my phone indoors with standard usage
 The screen brightness was mentally set between around 20-40% the entire day
 When I plugged in the phone when going to bed I had oh and 45 min of battery time and 5 hours of screen on time
 I still had 20% battery left
 The battery is as awesome as before!(Note:
 Because this global version is the same as the os version and only differs by having different Os bands have copied my review from the os version.)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------The
 Moto G was a huge hit for Motorola in 2013, as it provided many people with a fast new smartphone at an extremely unfordable prices
 Now in 2014, Motorola has updated the Moto G with its second iteration.
 There are many similarities with the first generation and a few important changes/improvements.Similarities:-Same screen resolution 1280x720-Same CPU, Snapdragon 400 (1.2ghz quand core)-Same, Os only conductivity no LTE in this model)-Same 2070mah batteryImprovements/Changes:-Screen size changed from 4.5" to 5"-Front camera upgrade from 1.3MP to 2MP-Rear camera upgrade from 5MP to 8MP-Speaker upgrade from mon rear speaker to front sterno speakers-MicroSD card slotDisadvantages compared to first generation:-Some dislike the bigger screen-Slightly worse battery life due to bigger screen size with same battery size-Pixel density dropped from 326ppi to 294ppiWhile this second generation Moto G has slightly worse battery life and fixed density than the first generation these are minute differences that will most likely go unnoticed
 That does matter thought is that the second generation Moto G build on the successes of the first Moto Os and adds multiple improvements to make this a truly excellent low budget phone
 By main complaints about the first gen Moto G focused on the poor camera performance and lack of os card sloth
 Now this and more has been improved with the second generation
 Father than an revolution this is an evolution of the previous Moto Os making it better than ever.The first thing you notice when picking up the second generation Moto G is that its bigger
 all admit it its harder to hold this phone with one hand when compared to the first generation
 However the big beautiful screen makes up for it
 While I no longer own the first gen for side to side comparison the screen feels like its brighter and more color accurate
 The front facing speakers are a huge plus if you watch video or your phone as you no longer have to cup your hand around the back of the phone to reflect the sound towards your face
 Probably as a result of them facing you all the time the speakers also seem to be louder
 His also brings around an advantage if you use the speakers to play music since you no longer have to put the phone face down for the sound to remain unmuffled.The camera are also a HUGE improvement
 Os a a college student I use the front camera quite a lot to communicate with friends
 The previous front facing camera (FFC) was very splotchy and muddy
 The new FFC honestly feels like its better than the rear facing camera on the first genu
 Although I didn use the rear camera on the first gen very often the one in this phone seems to have better color reproduction and dynamic range
 To put the camera upgrade into perspective its roughly like going from an shone 4 to an shone 5.All these improvements are available for the same MSRP ($179.99)
 as before which is an excellent deal especially considering the fact that the phone now has a Micro os card sloth the 8GB board memory poses less of an issue
 I will keep this review updated if I face anything that changes my opinion of this phone but for now it deserves a 5/5.

 Wonderful phone
 Twitched from a Nexus 4 to this because I was fed up with poor battery life
 The screen is absolutely gorgeous
 Its vivid and bright and puts my nexus 4 screen to shame
 The phone has a premium feel with a nice weight and soft touch back
 Certainly doesn feel like a sub $200 phone and in my opinion feels better than some plastic flagship honest
 Battery life so far has been excellent easily lasting a full day with average usage and screen set to 75% brightness
 The performance is sappy with no noticeable lag whatsoever
 Front speakers are nice upgrade couture video and calls on speaker sound crisp and clear
 I threw in an micro os and transferred pictures video and music to it quickly in the storage settings
 I am not sure how installing apes to the os card will work but I am not sure I will need to do that if I keep all my media on the os card.The only hesitation I had about buying this phone was lack of LTE.
 HSPA+ speed on Mobile have been around 5 Obs down which is more than adequate for browsing mobile sites couture video streaming music and navigation
 I am able to do all of these things without noticeable delay so I personally dont mind the lack of LTE.
 I contemplated this model vs the 2013 Moto G with LTE and decided to go with this for the larger display and better camera.In all if you are on a cell phone plan that does not offer phone subsidy or use a repaid service this really is an incredible value
 It does not feel like a cheap phone
 Sure there are some deficiencies like lack of LTE and 1 os of ram but if those things agent crucial to you then there is little to differentiate this $180 phone from phone that are prices over $600 in terms of user experience

 Quick review His is the best value phone there is and more!Disclosure: I am upbraiding from Samsung S4...yes, you heard it right!Pros:1.
 180$ unlocked
 I mean you canst get better than that for these specs.2.
 Surprisingly has gyroscope...So, all those os games work fine
 And work well
 First Men did not have that.3.
 Its not as low end as you might think
 Lowered by 1.2Ghz quand core 1GB RAM which is more than sufficient for most applications and decent graphics its no slough
 Everything is super fluid so far
 In fact I am surprised how fluid this device is
 Samsung Os got sloughy because of the boatload of Samsung applications running in the background.4.
 os 720p screen is awesome!
 There was a time when Apple sold 540p screen and advertised it as retina display and everybody went gage
 Well even at os 720p, this is still a retina display with close to 300ppi.
 Os people labouring for 1080p screen on Moto Os shut up...:-)5.
 Battery life
 That can I say
 His was a surprise for me
 Excellent standby time and great daytime use time
 I slept with battery at 81% and woke up with 80%, that os consumed in os hours
 During the day for my normal use it drains at around 1-3% per hour as per better battery states program
 It stays in deep sleep most of the times
 I use Assist's Battery Tavern feature and have wife os all the time
 Bluetooth and GPS are off most of the time.6.
 Digging the sound coming out of front speakers
 To much better than my happy Samsung S4's rear speaker!7.
 GPS locks in less than 2 seconds
 To much better than Samsung S4, where I had to wait for 5 mind sometimes.8.
 Works with MicroSD cards of 64GB size
 It was advertised as only unto 32GB but it works fine if you format with fat before hand in your os or Sinus OS my preference command is mkfs.msdos
 Os 32 /dev/sdi, assuming /dev/sdi is the card).9.
 Mitka 4.4.4 and the ability to clock bootloader good for folks who dont care about warranty
 without jumping through hoofs
 Sure andros experience!10.
 Ability to move apes to os cards unless an pp specifically insist on not being allowed to move.Cons:1.
 Heap ass buttons
 That Motorola!
 They are really cheap
 But in better power and volume buttons in Gen3.
 Please...:-)2.
 Heavy
 Coming from S4, this was heavier but it feels solid in my hands and there is no chance of this slipping out of my hands like Os because its not as slippery as Os in the back
 I dont mind the weight but some people might.3.
 Non-removable battery
 His is not excusable
 Since the cover is removable the battery should be took
 Of it was one piece like Apple iPhone, I would grant this but its not
 Anyway this is minor
 I can carry a spare charger for it
 And longterm, I hope the battery keeps working until I am ready to upgrade again.Update 1 Act os 2014): Some folks have asked how much internal storage we have left after we install typical apply I have about 3.4GB left after about 35 apes I use
 I dont have big time games apart from Angry birds but typical apes like whatsapp, firefox, outlook yahoo, banking apply skype, sudoku, tetris, vice him netflix and many others I dont recall etc
 His includes about 200MB of history I imported from my old phone for whatsapp.
 I think 5.5GB of space is plenty for a typical install and there is no need to worry
 Moreover this phone DOES allow to move apes some apes may block this operation to os cards
 Os you can free up space if you need to down the road
 Its a non-issue IMHO!Update 2 Act os 2014): Having used the phone for a week now this phone continues to impress me
 Quick update of charging time I started at around 43% and it charged to 86% in under 2 hours
 Using a cable directly attached to the USB port on motherboard and NOT* to a USB hubs
 Or else use the supplied wall charge

 I purchased a white Motorola G and generation to replace my st generation Moto Os By main motivation to buy was the improved camera in the and gen over the st generation
 The bigger screen was a nice side effect
 I got used to the screen size quickly
 I am disappointment about the quality of the photos thought
 The pictures can be quite grain still
 Of your sole motivation is the improved camera I dont recommend the upgrade from Moto G to the and genet week ago I started having problems with the headphone jack and want able to fully insert the headphone jack and thus unable to make phone calls over my headset.
 I called in Motorola Customer Are and described the problems
 They were quick to say that they can send out a replacement unit since this kind of malfunction cannot be fixed remotely.
 But first they had to verify I bought this phone in the US.
 I was surprised by that request but nonetheless submitted my receipt showing delivery to my place in California
 Little did I know
 It took me another 3 attempts to resolve this issue over the phone
 Very time I called and explained my situation I was put on hold for extended periods of time while the representative was talking to another department
 In the end I even submitted a photo of the box the phone came in including the packing slip
 The last rep I contracted said that my case has been excavated as High Priority in the Department today
 That was exactly three days ago and I have yet to hear back from Motorola Customer Service
 From a service point of view Motorola gets zero Stars
 The phone is ok but since I am not able to use it without the headphone it gets only one start

 him typically not one for buying brand new products as I like to avoid buying things that are not well-established yet but him glad I decided to recorder this
 To avoid having this sound too much like a sales pitch him just going to say what comes to mind in whatever order it comes to mind...The screen is a good size and is very easy to ready
 There is a lot of detail for such a small screen and I was very happy with how it all looked.The phone feels solid in your hand without feeling too bulky
 It os admittedly a pretty liable phone so I wouldn suggest getting this for someone who has tiny hands but for someone with average size hands or bigger it feels nice to hold and is easy to use.The touch screen is responsive and accurate
 I haven done much in the way of multi-touch for testing but the little bit have encountered has gone just fine so I expect that it all works pretty well.Having the may slot was a fantastic addition over the original Moto Os and frankly if you get something like a 32GB may cards your never going to feel like your running out of space.When I first got the phone I want sure how the camera quality was going to be as I was upbraiding from a phone with a 3.2 os camera so I didn think 8MP was going to be a humorous improvement... that was when I realized how much of an effect the phone itself has on how good the pictures it takes are
 By old phone was sluggish at the best of times so even the 2MP front camera on the Moto G takes fantastic pictures by comparison
 The 8MP camera on the back focused well and takes great pictures for the typical person
 Of you really want high-quality pictures perhaps you should consider a proper camera but for a phone this does a great job was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the speakers
 Typically speaking and be using headphones for music but I did check out the sterno speakers for the sake of testing and they had a much nicer sound than I expected them to have
 whereas not much bass to speak of but the rest of the sound spectrum sounds quite nice coming out of the phone even at higher volumes and with noise music.Lastly, the conductivity of the phone is pretty solid
 its not 4G, but it does get the higher Os speed (HSPA+, etc and data usage has always felt quite sappy when your in an area with decent coverage
 I use mine with Straight Talk (AT&T service through them and him very happy with italy
 only minor qualms with the phone is the battery
 Of you watch how you use the phone the battery lasts quite a while and is more than sufficient
 However if you agent too careful with your usage of the internet and such on the phone you can drain the battery more quickly than I would like
 Still though - phone weren designed to be used too extensively so as long as your using it sensibly its still plenty of battery life

 Already many people gave reviews about the speck and technical stuff of this smartphone so I will just limit my review to my first impressions.First,
 I bought this phone on the Saber Monday sale here on Amazon at $149, the regular price at the moment was $179 so it was a good deal
 The reason I bought it was mainly because my old phone a Motorola War os was literally dying the battery was bloated to the point it slowly broke the phone
 Amazon delivered this phone 3 days before expected by UPS, so that a plus.The good part Of you have doubts about this phone forget about it
 It looks and feels like a high end expensive one
 In addition was impressed with how it guided me and helped me to migrate all my old phone stuff (photos, video music apply smoothly with the Motorola migrate pp
 I felt I didn have to do a things
 I also was impressed with the speakers the sound is fantastic compared with other honest and the battery life that last way more than other phone I used before.The bad part When I received the package the box was almost open like someone wanted to week inside but when I finally opened it everything I bought was there the Moto G and gen and a cases
 When I took the phone out of the box I noticed right away it had a very small went in the right side along the border
 I looked closely every bit of the phone and have to say that it slightly felt like somebody used this phone already
 I couldn tell for sure
 Also the charger didn fit the phone
 I tried to connect the charger to the phone and had to stop because I seriously thought I was going to damage the phone if I continued
 him using another Motorola charger instead
 Beside these issues the phone look good and these are the only bad thing I can say about this phone
 I still recommend it.What
 him looking forward I can wait for the Lollipop software update as I have seen video of the improvements
 I also wish that this phone doesn have the same issue as my old Motorola os battery bloating).
 I really dont like that you can take the battery out.I'm still exploring my new phone
 I wrote this review only 24 hours after getting it so I will give an updated review of my experience with it later

 I was reading the news on my phone one night when suddenly the screen went off
 I pressed the power button to wake the screen...nothing.
 The phone went completely dead
 I then held down the power button till the ratification LED came on about 20 seconds later and then the screen lit up only to show os battery
 His made no sense because my phone was fully charged when I was using it
 And the phone was in no way pressed for resources
 all let it charge I thought...but what I observed next was The ratification LED lit up again and went off
 The screen lit up again only to show os charge and then went off
 His cycle kept on repeating itself for about 3 hours till and had enough am disappointed and surprised
 Never expected this from a Motorola products

 I am VERY impressed with the battery life on this phone!!! after a 14hr day with 2.5 his of screen on time and some gaming the phone is still at 60% battery the best battery life I have seen in any phone to date
 also after leaving the phone over night without plugging it in (10hrs) it seems to only drop about os so the standby time is great as well
 being that this phone is stock andros it is very fast and no begging down
 this is a much better phone than my Samsung galaxy s all the way around

 I had the Galaxy Os from ATT, unlocked it and moved over to T-mobile.
 It was giving me issues so I decided to get a temporary phone until the next big thing comes out in 2015.
 To I went with this phone
 For what it costs it is a great phone
 Coming from an S4, you could tell the difference in speed and processing as this phone is a bit slower but it isn a big deal
 It moves smoothly and I just make sure not to run crazy amount of apply
 have always done that anyway
 Unfortunately not LTE, but here in the West side of Miami, get decent speed with T Mobile
 Yesterday I actually blocked 9.7 Lips download speed at the FIU camps
 Not bad at all
 Sure it isn the 20 plus I would get with LTE but I never needed that much speed anyway
 For my social medial browsing video testing it is all I need him sure hardware users and developer would need more but this wouldn be a phone you would look for anyway
 His is a budget friendly phone that can do everything the big name phone can do for the average user and by average I mean you social media addicts).

 nerve had this phone for a couple months now and it was the best thing we did
 Went from a Galaxy 3 and os considering a new Os when we first heard about the Moto G 2. For about one third the price you get a phone equal and in some ways better.The Moto is water resistant actually it can be briefly submerged with no problem however it is not made for snorkeling or constant underwater use
 The Gorilla glass screen is bright clear and really tough
 The phone is lightning fast camera takes great pick and overall appearance is at least as good as the Samsung.Some fluff features are not present but I cannot see even using some of those extra like a million camera adjustments or tons of necessary and unwanted software
 One thing lacking is a file manager and flashlight pp but they can be easily download from Google Lay store for free in minutes
 In the upside and rather install the apes I want rather then have Samsung fill up the phone with stuff they think I want.All in all a very smart moved you wont go wrong with the Moto G-2, and look on may for a myriads of cases and other accessories.
 Os far as some friends turning up their nose because it is not a Galaxy the extra cash in my pocket plus having a very attractive and more capable phone gives me the last laugh

 His is a great second operation to what is arguably the best budget Android smartphone on the market
 The screen is perfect the dual front firing speakers are awesome, the matter back finish feels good in hand and overall the general Android experience is pretty solid
 By only grip is the home screen tends to re-draw itself a lot after leaving an pp
 Maybe this will get fixed with the release of Android Lollipop?
 Either way this is still a great hands if your looking for what is essentially the stock Google experience on a phone but without having to pay a premium for the hardware use this on T-Mobile and get great downlink speed on HSPA+, typically around 8-10Mbps.
 The battery with my personal usage lasts about 1-1/2 to 2 days while being to use for checking email twitter playing a few games watching Plex/YouTube/Twitch, and reading a few webster forms
 I can push it to around 3-4 days on a single charge possibly more if I dont play any games or watch video
 Really impressed I can only imagine how crazy the battery life on the st generation Moto G was compared to the and genu
 That said
 His is a great phone
 Of your not a power smartphone user this is the one to get
 Need a back phone to use worldwide
 Met the Global GSM version of this
 You wont be disappointed

 I am bowed by this phone
 I have Consumer Cellular and motivation with a new mini-SIM card they sent me could not have been easier
 I replaced a Samsung Rugby Smart and didn realize it had a regular sized SIM so I had to wait a day or two to activate it
 Consumer Cellular offers a version of this phone but it wont get the new Lollipop andros software and this one will
 I dont plan on going out of the country but I bought the global version because it was available and it gives no problems with my carrier at all
 All my Rugby Smart charges (car/house/usb) work perfectly with the Moto G so dont try and buy a lot of extra stuff for it
 It does need a case in my opinion and I got a nice one from Amazon that protects it well but doesn add to the size of it much.I've never been one who was interested in watching couture video or anything but this Moto G has such a dynamic screen and such great sterno speakers now I canst resist
 It is truly light years ahead of the Rugby Smart although it was a good phone for me too.The size is perfect and I wouldn want any bigger
 It can still fit on my belt or in my pocket but any bigger and it wouldn I dont think
 Felt Posters are available through Amazon took
 Really I predict you will love this phone

 Some thoughts after two weeks of ownership Great service from Amazon beat the estimated delivery time by several days.The phone seems to be built very well doesn feel cheap at all
 The removable back os plastic but has kind of a soft rubber 'grippy' feel to it
 Somewhat curved nice
 To added come trim or any unnecessary clutter.The screen is HUGE compared to the less than four inches that I came from
 Right clear plenty of room to navigate.
 I have a nice big weather wide on my home screen and there plenty of room for additional pp shortcuts.I'm using T-Mobile and so far so good
 Purchased the SIM card from Target for $9.99.
 I transferred my number from Virgin mobile no problems
 $45 a month for unlimited texts and talk 2GB data
 him NOT a heavy data user mainly browsing the web when him on a network
 It home I use WI-Fi.
 To far after two weeks have used 240MB of data 2GB will be plenty for me
 The Os log shows on my phone most of the time and pages load up quickly
 Voice calls are clear I used Type to call my Tom in Germany (I'm in Indiana and no issues.The phone comes with Motorola's 'Migrate' pp and I used this to transfer my contact and MMS messages from my old Android phone
 It just took a couple of minutes and everything was transferred unbelievably simple put a 32GB micro os card for additional storage
 All of my pictures and my apes that are able to be will be kept on the cards
 About 3GB is left on my internal storage so having that extra space is nice haven used the camera THAT much but seems os for the basis
 I like to run them through Instagram for posting and they seem fine
 The camera settings are easily accessible and I suggest you play with them a bit to get the results that you like.The phone shipped with Android 4.4.4 and having read that 5.0 was on its way this was one main reason I wanted this phone
 I was checking for updated daily both on the phone and via Motorola's Device Manager program on my PC, no updated
 I finally read on an Android site how to do the update manually, followed all the instructions and was able to install 5.0.1.
 Half a day later I was notified that 5.0.2 was ready to install from Motorola, go figure
 have only had a couple of days on the new version but I really do like its interface
 It does seem like it uses less available RAM than what 4.4.4 was using when I check my settings
 Smooth as silk so far...There is very little in the way of unheeded 'junk-ware' on the phone
 Os you may or not may know most manufacturers put their own software over the top of Android, causing performance issues and making the phone a little less unable
 His is almost pure Android and that the way it should be
 In my opinion this is the way to own a cell phone your not tied down to a carrier and your not paying extra every month for the privilege of using a smart phone gave it five stars what the hell
 I figure that it makes up for the one stars posted because the phone was destroyed in a tragic gardening incident or fell out of a moving car and quit working.Peace

 I purchased this phone through Consumer Cellular they refer to it as the Moto G EXT) and was was fully impressed with its capabilities
 and much prefer this phone over any iPhone, and the price is only a fraction the cost
 Its biggest disadvantage is that few accessories are available
 However I did find several acceptable cases but could not find a charging dock that was made for the phone
 To I looked for any charging dock that might work and found the Elkins PowerHouse Micro USB Charge and Zinc Lock
 His dock not only works nicely with the phone but with a small modification to any cases it will also work with a case on the phone
 The modification requires only widening the hole in the case for the charging port to 1-1/4" or more so that the case slips over a raised part of the dock
 With the "Daydream" setting on the phone combined with the Elkins dock the phone now acts a convenient clock even while asleep

 Os the title of this review states so much bang for the buck on this phone
 have had no issues at all running the andros version of my phone apes eyes him trying out android),I've read all the reviews and want to address the top three negative that people have levied against this phone:1.
 Fixed density of the screen is low Noticeable if your nose is six inches from the screen and staring hard
 Otherwise a non-issue/2.
 Battery life By phone lasts about 2 days between charges with light to moderate use
 I understand that not bad for an andros phone
 Your call.3.
 Not 4G: I dont stream moves over the phone via cellular so I canst comment on that
 For everything else that I get on line for have seen no speed issues whatsoever
 Takes me wonder what the payoff is for 4GLTE...For $180 bucks its an easy call to pick this phone up just to try it out

 For those not consumed by the hype/status/marketing of the cell phone world this is a great no nonsense bargain phone...especially if your not locked into a contract
 $180 gets you plenty and now has Lollipop.

 Good phone for the prices
 Since upbraiding to lollipop, I have experienced random freezing that only a hard boot fixes
 Would not recommend doing the lollipop upgrade until this issue is resolved
 Hopefully in 5.0.3

 Good price and decent feature list
 But poor performance
 Battery charge level cracking is erratic
 The phone hangs up often
 The 8 os internal RAM is really not sufficient
 May a little more and buy a 16GB phone

 Uncluttered andros 5.0 OS, no june apes since it is unlocked not from any provider
 Not all apes can be moved to os cards depends on pp writers

 I loved the original Moto Os but the power button is absolutely terrible on this phone you have to really mash it to get it to work
 its a decent phone but it just feels cheap compared to the first version

 I purchased this as a lightning deal for a friend that lives overseas (Ukraine).
 They are loving it
 Flush the cost is fairly low for an unlocked Android phone
 Note that it does use the newer microSIM cards

 Excellent price for a really amazing telephone , the goose pure andros OS is just lawless and its lolllipop version is still better Motorola will take the middle cost segment with this telephone for sure

 Very tough reliable and has a great battery life
 Lots of bang for your buck compared to anything else on the market in this price range

 Side from the sterno sound its the exact same as the first Men processor screen etc
 And it accepts os cards
 But if you dont mind those two differences then go with the first Men and save a hundred bucks

 Before I begin I will fill you in on why I bought this phone
 I downgraded from an shone 6 after dropping it in the water
 With warranty I thought my best option was to shell out $180 dollars for this phone instead of fixing my shone and save $120 dollars by doing so read extensive reviews and came to conclusion for the price this phone had the best features
 him somewhat familiar with the Android Operating system so twitching was somewhat exciting for me
 His phone does not live up to Androids standards
 It will frequently get very slow on you
 You'll be accustomed to "Unfortunately, this program had to quite and poor whatever you where just doing is gone
 I figured I could live with it but it soon began to eat away at me
 Small features you may have become accustomed to will not be prevalent in this phone.Now, this phone isn horrible but you'll need to learn patience using it
 After two months of use I ended up getting my shone fixed.If your looking for a basic phone and use it for minimal purposes buy this phone.If your heavy user of your phone or your expecting a Galaxy or shone quality phone stay away

 Alright I will start here first that I have had nexus 4 for the past 2.5 years and I am an andros fan
 I bought this phone recently for my wife
 It worked fine although it got slower as the not of installed apes increased in a month (~10).
 It has andros 5.0.2.
 Almost half of RAM gets occupied by the bare minimum apes you download
 But not that not it
 The phone has instantly switched off multiple times even though the battery is full
 INSTANT BATTERY DRAIN!
 I have tried multiple fixes factory rest charging-recharging process etc
 Since amazon provides only 1 month warranty you are left with 1 year manufacturers warranty with Motorola who doesn even respond on phone
 Flush their policy says that most likely they will ship you a return phone if they can fix this one
 Otherwise you got to pay them to ship your phone
 Pp like gaily whatsapp and goose maps take forever to open even though its only been a months
 Accessing data from the data card is way too slow took
 I have no gaming apes installed
 I dont think I made the best decision made in buying this phone
 Os if you dont anna end up in the same soup as me dont buy this phone
 Buy something better
}

 You owe it to yourself to use Sure Android.

 Highly Recommended

JuanNadal
 excellent sound good idea by Motorola include two speakers os sound sounds like
 The screen is great once you get used to it it is not too big nor too small
 The curvature is excellent accommodate your less easy and perfect grip
 Weighs almost nothing not felt
 Regarding the battery I think it is excellent with prolonging cell lasts me 8-9 hours for example every day I get up at 7 and discontent the phone from the charger immediately and lasts me until 8-9 night if you want to know an example right now is 8:34 and my battery percentage is 26%.
 The pure andros software already know I love
 usually difficult to find the available cell but sent it quickly brings the box manual and charger longer than normal charges bone os they say everything in it is excellent I thoroughly recommend for some reason he is the king of the midrange.

 I bought two of these honest one for my wife bought directly from Motorola since Amazon was out of stock of white ones and a black one for myself
 They replaced a HTC Sensation Os was a flagship phone for about 15 minutes in 2011) and a cheap os E-612 Android phone that we picked up in Australian
 gets just say that these new phone blow our old ones out of the water
 The screens are nice and clear
 Who cares if they agent 1920x1080 pixels, they look fantastic
 They are fast run all the apes we want and get great signal where our old phone let us down
 were both on repaid plans and we get great connection speed for our needs
 His is truly the best deal on a smartphone for those who dont wish to sign a contract with the devil to rent to own a phone for two years

Hamza Tahir
 A friend brought this from the states to Pakistan for me and I have seriously fallen in love with it
 West phone for the prices by far
 The display is gorgeous and overall its generally very smooth and fluid
 The camera is VERY good and perform very well in sunlight
 Battery life is just normal nothing special.There are some drawback , as is to be expected from a budget phone
 The battery is non removable so that could be a problem for some people
 It also drains pretty quickly using mobile data but that true for all honest
 It lasts the day for me so ism happy
 Part from that the phone is awesome!This phone doesn feel like a $180 phone
 You canst go wrong with it
 Am recommending to all my friends here

 Awesome ... West Budget phone that actually works well.Does the job for me Google Caps Notify and Accept Walls - through Bluetooth - War - Works fearlessly - without any lag.#
 Facebook, whatsapp, messenger , Type , Youtube, Flipboard, Hangouts - works real well without any lag.Best part and surprising for me was the screen os its really good.Pro's- Android 4.4 - clean OS.- Screen is very good great viewing angles
 Camera is good
 Back and front
 Battery Life.-
 Memory Expansion.Con's- CPU and Memory could have been upgrade from last year model
 LTE - hopefully in next few months it will be available

 Delivery by Amazon was very fast , I ordered this phone on a Monday and by Friday had it in my hand
 have had it for just 3 days but am already in love with the phone
 Must popped my discard in and it worked great calls are very clear and reception is great , camera is great and shoots very clear pick battery isn incredible but very acceptable even with regular use wife connect quickly video run smoothly and look great in the big os screen
 I will update my review when I have more time with the phone but for now I love it , works great , and for less than $200 it has features than you can find on most bigger budget honest
 You canst ask for much more , for this prices

Unanimous
 His phone shakes the smartphone market for the following reasons:1.
 Contract Shone - The phone does not have a phone carrier log anywhere on it
 You are free from the phone companies
 You are independent
 Freedom!!2.
 Excellent Price of $179.99 - Hats all you pay for the phone
 Period
 To other strings attached
 To carrier subsidy.3.
 Stock Android 4.4.4 - Virgin version of the Android software from Google.
 Sure software
 To carrier customized unaware or bloatware.
 Barrier customizations of the Android software makes your phone slow and you dont get the latest version of Android.4.
 Choice of Barrier is Side open - You can switch between any carrier in a SPLIT SECOND.
 To worries of paying a contract termination fee.5.
 os hardware for the seller Price - Great screen
 Great specs.This move by Motorola For is a smart smart smart smart genius move that customers love
 I canst wait to get the Moto G rd generation phone to come out in 2015 after purchasing this for my wife

Kyle Greer
 I bought this phone as a good budget option since I am on StraightTalk and needed something to replace my dated shone 4. Since January I have noticed a significant slow down in my phone processing ability even after keeping all apes and Android OS up to date
 The nail in the coffin just came yesterday when after reaching os battery practically a daily occurrence I was unable to charge the phone
 I have left the phone on the charger overnight and still no sign of life
 By advice STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE!
 I used to love my older Motorola honest but unless they pull some fantastic customer support consider this my last purchase with their brandy

 His is really good smart phone and greatprice.battery
 life have used a 3.5 hour on front light .
 I was using a web brother and some apes between.battery
 remaining after 20 hours was 15%! then cut the 15% when the battery save start.This phone is great if you can a some compromise on camera function.The back of the design is a great and cut
 i changed shell case it to blue、Ｉ'ｍ very happy!For use in Japan domo fomaプラスエリアでは使えないようです.私はＩＩＪＭＩＯのみおフォンでつかってます。 AＰＮ設定もされていてシムカードをさすだけで使えました。日本語も装備されていましたが入力はgoogle入力アプリなどをplay storeからダウンロードする必要がありました。余計なアプリがプリインストールされてないので動作も軽く快適に使えています。カメラ性能はiPhoneなどの高級機とはサスガに違いますが大変気に入っています！

 Similar speck to the shone os yet $450 cheaper
 Apple makes insane profit margins in the shone because people are willing to pay for it
 Met the hardware they put into their phone is mostly on the lower end
 wont throw your money away
 Screen on G is larger with similar resolution to iPhone.
 Dear camera are both imp but G has better front camera with imp versus 1.5mp for apple
 Both have 1GB of ram
 G only has 8GB internal storage but can easily add more with cheap micro os cards
 G has 720p video and shone has 1080p.
 The biggest difference between the phone is the shone has noticeably faster processor with better graphics processor
 James will load and run better on the iPhone.
 Of games are a priority get the iPhone.
 Otherwise for your everyday tasks the G is just as good and in some ways better
 Update to the new Android Lollipop OS and enjoy the fantastic new UI.
 its gorgeous and every bit as good as in and then some

 Was hardware Samsung and now using Os until now.From today i am going to switch to motorola.I planning to but this from long time finally got it I gifted to this my Had and he was delighted and loved it from the first touch on it.PROS- Price,no one can ever give this kind of piece with this price in this globe 720p os screen Extended memory sloth Master CPU Had core Qualcomm- Android 4.4.4-
 Smooth back to holding plastic back but smooth touch rubber kind i think 8 os CAM- os Radio optionCONS-Little weight-Non removable battery

{
Rhythm
 Really great phone for prices
 I ordered the global grm and works fine with T-Mobile for those who need to use it in USA and globally.
 I like the andros 5 experience on phone
 The phone may get little baggy when you have a lot of going tasks due to just 1 os ram but you can keep on closing unused windows and clear RAM in a timely manner to get good performance
 Os long as you dont overcoat the phone with hardware intensive software it works great for day to day use on browsing email YouTube, music and social networking apply
 And a I enjoy the 5 inch screen on this phone
}
{
Felix
 His is the best value for a phone that have seen for a long time
 I bought this for my dad and he loves the phone to death
 The build quality is very fine considering the prices and the increased screen size is very well appreciated
 You shouldn notice a difference between this screen and those Full os screens on higher end honest
 Thanks to Motorola's light skin the phone doesn lag one bit
 It flies through tasks like a beast
 Of you are looking for a great smartphone or Android experience and doesn want to spend too much on it this is the phone for you

 The moto G improves on what its predecessor lacked micro os card slot,beautiful os inch display and 8MP camera .Pros-5" display-front speakers are loud n clearing network or call drops-8MP camera takes amazing pictures when HDR mode is on-micro os slot up to 32gbCon'sBattery performance is good but they could have implements a 2500mah battery instead of 2070mah.watch the detailed review which includes sound,video,gaming,web streaming tests herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA9T13UevsA

 Great
 For $180, this phone is outstanding
 Incredibly fast and reliable
 Comes with 4.4.4
 kit At
 Screen looks gorgeous
 Only 720p but it looks superb
 Speakers sound good
 Performance I would say in on par with the s or the shone 5. os screen so its decent size but one hand use is still double
 Camera is great
 (8mp) front camera is also not too shabby
 Comes with LED flash and it works well
 Overall
 Fantastic device
 Would recommend to any been or really anybody
 For how well this device performed its pricetag is unbelievable.
}
{
Always Right
 so far its sipping the battery which was a major concern with the and generation reviews
 I have only installed a couple things so far but I think All like this for quite some time Android on roads
 I was still using my Os which was a great united
 I am in os and bought the global version no worries it works fine on ATT network coverage and have even read that it works on most of the Print network that it was supposed to not cover as well have only had this a few days so All come back if it takes a cap on me

Volkhard Neumann
 gave my old Moto E to my girlfriend and upgrade myself to the Moto G and G).
 Familiar with the Moto line I think they are one of the best values in their price range
 I am using the Moto G now for one month and had no issues at all
 Android is running fast enough and the camera are taking good snapshots as I dont need them to replace my DSRL.
 Battery keeps up reasonably although I am not a super heavy user who is on his phone all day long
 For me going with another Motor has been again a good decision

 Though I like gadgets, I have strong reservations about spending too much after a phone
 To I never ran behind the hopes for iPhone, Galaxy Os etc
 But I was always looking for a decent smartphone that serves my purposes.It is not obviously best phone in market but its genuinely best valued phone well at least to me
 It meets almost all expectations including the price tags
 I canst expect a better phone at this prices will recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent smartphone for less than $200.

 I want to like this phone...
 I really do
 But its so slow and glitchy.
 Pp take a long time to launch mapping feels almost unusable, the settings for sounds and modifications seem more confusing than most
 When I first got it I liked the screen size and it felt well made
 After using it for a few months him just not happy with the performance
 It may be my imagination but I think it did work a lot better before the upgrade to lollipop from kitkat.
 Seems a lot slower and clunkier now

J. Glick
 Definitely the best value for the money smart phone I have purchased
 I wish it came default with 16gb internal but the good news is it takes larger cards than the 32gb cards the description lists as maximum size
 I have a 64gb card in it now which is the largest size I had and after formation it in phone it took it with no problems
 It is limited a little by the go ram as well but not extensively
 Biggest thing I see is the desktop page redraws.
 Very once in a while the touch screen is glitchy, but more an annoyance than anything serious
 I would recommend to anyone wanting an off contract os or International phone
 I got an international version for use in Africa

 Made the switch from Apple to Android.
 Shone works fine
 The OS is somewhat of a learning curved
 After a while things are coming together
 I like the larger screen
 The speakers are great
 They are much better than lets say a small translator radio
 I had a shone os and those speakers were adequate
 I like the camera pp that comes with the phone
 I would do it again
 The battery takes somewhat longer to recharge.
 It seems to last longer than my Os did
 The price was great
 I bought it from amazon warehouse
 These are returns and open box items
 Saved close to $30.
 I would have a hard time going back to a top of the line phone when this does all I need

 Very dissatisfied!It does not work with WindMobile Canada!!!Eventhough it has the required bands according to the description and it is supposed to work it cannot identify wind network in Canada.Wind is an AWS and requires 1700, and 2100 MHz..
 But this phone still doesn work..Here is what the description says it has:Bands by model os GSM Model GSM/GPRS/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz) UMTS/HSPA+ (850, 1700 (AWS), 1900 MHz) Global GSM Model GSM/GPRS/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz) UMTS/HSPA+ (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz)Someone should do something
 such a waste of money

 Until now I had been cell phone free since 2006, so I dont have any experience with other current cell phone models and therefore I am unable to compare this phone to others on the market
 That I can say is that this phone has been great for me and I have not had any problems with it.Since it currently runs the most recent version of Android (5.0 Lollipop) it has been compatible with every pp I have thrown at it and does so with ease.The only complaint that I have with this phone is the average quality of the built-in camera
 However that is to be expected with any sub-$200 smart phone

 The phone seems good great sized screen battery last a long time it really seems like an overall great phone.... HOWEVER... just two days after getting it fell on the floor as I was opening the door of my house the screen is now completely cracked now with is very disappointing to say the least os my previous Samsung Galaxy s mind accidentally fell on the floor numerous times and was way more resistant.So now I have to either put on a new screen on this new cell phone or forget about the purchase and go to my old one
 To be extra careful holding it or buy a really good case with it

 The constant main screen re-draws, only running 1 pp at a time without reporting every other one and slow everything were bad enough.Now if I do ANYthing at all it locks up and needs to be rebooted.
 Os there isn too much on it
 Os nothing weird was downloaded.
 whereas no excuse for the phone
 its just garbage.This is after 2 months
 I didn save the receipt bought in a stores not Amazon), but all be attempting to return this thing this weekend
 Miserable experience

 I ordered this phone in March...
 I didn activate until a month later in April
 It stopped working in June
 I hadn dropped it or damaged it in any way By first gen moto g was subjected to harsher treatments and survived
 Of you Google moto go wont boot you will see this isn uncommon
 When I contracted Motorola their option were less than appealing to me so I speed to get a new phone from a different company
 him terribly disappointed in Motorola and they have lost one loyal customers
}
{
Arun
 Its worth for the money that we pay
 its good for someone wanted to experience lolipop and a big screen phone
 but if anyone is thinking of doing a multitasking and gazing please dont buy this phone you will be disappointed
 but worth for every single penny
 it value more than the money that we pay
 that for sure
 that being said basic user should also go for this phone like streaming youtube, calls skype, testing etc
 And one more things camera is very poor
}
{
bookbuckeye
 The Moto G is nice phone when it works
 But do not expect Motorola to stand behind their claimed warranty
 In our phone the charging port quit working after 9 months
 He shipped it to Motorola per their instructions
 A month later they have still not repaired or replaced the phone even after repeatedly contracting them
 To a search and you will see many others that are having the same frustration with Motorola warranty problems

 And for people who said the sterno speaker quality isn good Its just amazing and super loud
 The phone built quality is too good , comes with an sd card slot to and the back material is awesome.171$
 its the best smarten available with stock andros like skin

 him very satisfied with the acquisition that I made
 It first it was too big but now I canst keep my hands off it you can watch moves brows the internet without a problems
 The screen is very good a 1080p would've been better but in this price range is perfect.I'm using the global version in Mania and everything works fine the call quality is clear the internet speed through g is pretty fast

 Couldn't ask for a better phone at this price range saw quite a few people complain about the battery life but let me tell you the battery life is just amazing got nearly 2 days on 1 charge which is fantastic however you look at it.The phone is solid and there absolutely no bloatware which in itself is impressive,not much more I can say but top drawer phone at low level price,well done motorola.

 Shone is unbelievably slow
 Of all your looking for is a phone to call and text with then this phone is okay
 Of you plan on downloading any apply look elsewhere it canst handle more than a few apes open at a time
 Cried using goose maps for directions and it clashes
 The speaker volume is terrible for having two front facing speakers and my bluetooth wont connect to anything

 His is quite possibly the best budget Smartphone to date
 I just upgrade from an HTC One X which I really did not consider an upgrade at first
 His Moto G is an amazing close and to the HTC! Believe it or not the dual speakers on the front actually provide louder sound than the HTC I had
 Of your heating on buying this phone I suggest you stop thinking about it and go ahead with the purchase
 Thumbs up Motorola

 It is much kinder to the wallet than an shone and it does everything my shone 4 did
 The screen is even bigger
 I love the Android OS.
 I use it all the time and though I like Apple I wont go back to an iPhone.

 His is really an incredible value
 The only limiting thing here is the storage on the phone which is more of a challenge for us than we anticipated even moving everything we could off to the sdcard).
 Either way the phone is very well built and is really a work of art for the price paid
 He are very happy with this purchase

 I have been the proud owner of a moto g must genu for the last years

 To LTE, but this isn a problem for me right now

 The Moto G 2014 has consistently received the reviews as one of the best of the budget smart honest
 I have the phone set up to use WIFI data exclusively so the absence of LTE is not a factor
 WIFI works great even at some of the free WIFI sites (McDonalds,ect.)..
 His phone has met or exceeded my expectations
}
{
Nirav P.
 have owned Samsung and HTC honest and while I love those honest Motorola has become my new favorite
 They stay true to the original andros and dont put any bloatware on it
 The sound is clear and it does what it needs to do

 I dont need a $400 os $600+ fashion statement or confirmation of my self-image.
 I can also do without a few megapixels on the camera when they do little more than clot the unload pipes.So far less than two weeks this is exactly what I was looking for - a reasonably-priced, updated replacement for my increasingly unstable Google Nexus 4 (N4).
 His and gen Moto os Android Lollipop version may not be quite up to the same revision as the Nexus but it also doesn shut-down or freeze frequently yet Given the current state of the art of enforced obsolescence and controlled lack of quality I expect this will soon start
 But him still hoping for a good 6-8 months or so.Display is nice - better & brighter than the N4, and certainly good enough
 Touch response better than the N4, but I haven put a screen protector on yet
 I love an abundance of power in nearly everything but I dont yet find a need for an excessive amount in a typical smartphone at least not without enterprise-level MDMs and VPNs).
 While I would have liked to have kept NFC, and added LTE, so far I dont miss either
 Of I wanted better security and get a new Blackberry or eyes I never thought and say it Windows 8 or 10 phone dont toll me about os Android - let alone iOS).
 Android pp response it better with this Moto - the processor speed seems to be a significant improvement over the N4.
 I lost 8 go of internal memory compared to my N4, but the micro-SD memory expansion slot will probably be better for my needs
 USB to go seems to function well limited testing so far)Speed, sensitivity and network functionality on T-Mobile's network seems to be at least as good as the Os - I still get 3G+ in all the places I used to and probably a few more
 Os may miss lack of LTE someday .
 Voice clarity might be a touch better on the Moto Os still think smartphones are the stupidest way to talk on a telephone yet invented - kind of like talking into a board on the side of your face during an intercontinental os Am radio telephone relay to Africa during the cold war
 I find the same network dead spots and extended registration times in a particular urban area that have been complaining about for years but they may be slightly smaller
 him not often a video streamers but when I do its pretty heavy - this phone is head and shoulders better than the N4.
 By home doesn have good cell signal from anyone so I rely on Wi-Fi there for bandwidth.
 His seems to work better than he N4; better range and slightly higher speed using 802.11n.
 all probably miss not having 802.11ac capability soon but not yet.Yes, the case is plastic
 You can support the PRC economy and try all the Moto shells you like if that an issue.Bottom line Maybe not perfect but very good and excellent value
 Highly recommended so far

BAH
 His is an excellent phone and it is the best andros phone under the $200 range.Pro:----- Excellent reception and call quality.-----
 Fig 5", gorgeous bright and crisp 294ppi screen gorilla glass)----- Very fast and responsive
 1GB Am is typical for this price range and it actually works really well with Lollipop 5.0.2.
 I have a ton of apes and had plenty of background apes running and the phone is still very fast and lag free
 I do recommend Clean Master pp with 1 tap boost button
 It is an excellent pp that frees some of the RAM.-----
 Lollipop 5.0.2 came with my phone
 It is an awesome operating system that is fast looks great and is easy to use
 I really think it is a big improvement over mitka with all the new features
 I heard some people complain about lag but I haven experienced any of that
 Last time I checked I even had 18 apes running in the background and the phone was still very fast and responsive.-----
 Very nice imp camera with flash
 It gets the job done for me but I am not the type of person who takes a ton of pictures or considered a camera expert
 The pictures and video forage look great and the user interface is user friendly with plenty of option for more advanced user.-----
 Speakers sound loud and clear with good bass
 With the headphones, music even sounds better
 Very happy with the sound.-----
 Unlocked phone
 It gives me options.-----
 Accepts Micro os cards
 Even though go is too little of storage Motorola fixed the problem by letting the phone accept Micro os cards
 I put a 32gb Micro os card in mine.Con----- Battery life
 His is my first large screen smartphone so I am not used to short term battery life
 With my smaller screen Windows Gumma phone I can easily go couple days without charging
 I think windows operating system is just more efficient than andros when it comes to using RAM and battery power
 I think with the large os screen and the lollipop system with so many running background apply it uses a lot of unnecessary RAM and battery power
 I noticed the Power through your day with the allay battery in the description as if that is something to brag about
 In my opinion every phone better last a full day and they should last 2 days on one charge with regular use
 him using Clean Master pp and disabled lot of unnecessary pp modifications so I may squeeze a One and half day battery power now
 Maybe in the future I will get Lollipop 5.1 or another update that will improve battery life
 I will look into getting a cheap portable battery charger too.-----
 Not Os LTE capable....
 Not a big deal for me though.Conclusion: Amazing phone with a bargain prices great specie awesome features and an impressive Lollipop 5.0.2 operating system
 All the pro easily compensated for the lackluster battery life
 Of you are a lesser user you may get a day and a half battery use
 I highly recommend this phone and I would rate it a 4.5 out of 5 stars

 Must to preface this I came to this mobile after owning a carrier branded Galaxy Os for just over 2 years.This mobile
 Oh gash this mobile
 I think the best way to describe it is indeed the highest of the low end
 However dont let that push you away
 For the price its hard to find a better andros experience even more so if you manage to find a used but in good condition or refurbished model for cheaper
 It is however not all sunshine and rainbows.Let's start with the bad
 The worst part of this device for me is the internal storage
 Right gigabites is just abysmaly small for most these days
 Yes you can work around it and Motorola does low you to move some apes to a micro os card which this will handle up to 32gigs of additional storage but I cannot find a way to install directly to the os card from the pp market
 His means going through a rather annoying process of judging apes around to get everything installed and I find that apes will be transferred back over to the internal storage whenever there an updated
 Very frustrating.
 I also found that the hands feels just a little bulky in the hand
 Not necessarily big its no Galaxy Note but just a little more sizeable than and appreciated
 The memory also can be a problem from time to time
 His is not a mobile for the heavy multitasker, and I find it being a bit more aggressive about closing apes if I switch around just barely too much
 His does depend on the apes used of course as some will have no issue with this while others will be notoriously bad)However, that about all I can really complain about
 Side from the lean storage memory and perhaps needing to go on a diet him very happy with everything else
 The display is plenty sharp and and bright the camera takes good quality stills and video both rear and front facing but by far my favorite part is the speakers
 Os there not great speakers but just the fact that there front facing and yes you get two of them by the way make them so much louder and clearer than most other devices have seen
 They may not be Room Round or Seats but for under 200 USD and argue there still hard to beat
 I also love how close to stock the andros experience feels on this mobile
 Motorola have quickly become one of my favorite OEMs for andros handiest just by how little they mess with the operating system
 Very light spinning a few custom apes which you do not have to use if you dont want to and can even disabled so you dont have to so much as see them and that your lot
 All quality has been great and even though it may not have LTE, I find that HSPA works plenty fast enough for my needs
 him currently going through Simple Mobile for my plan and data speed have never been an issue with this mobile.In short if your looking for a mobile on the cheaper end of the spectrum but still want something nice and you dont mind taking a hit on internal storage or memory I cannot recommend the Moto G 2014 more

 Great phone - this is my second Moto go
 Great sound features price and quality
 In my Moto g and Men with Lollipop OS when I put the brightness of the display on automatic (adaptive display the screen will go dark when I am indoors with low light
 One cannot see anything on the screen - the phone is useless
 Of one goes outside in daylight the screen is readable
 I have other phone and tablets with automatic display adjustment and the screen dim in indoors or low light - but the screen is clearly readable and unable
 A search of the internet indicates that others have the same problem with their Moto g and Men
 I have read several professional reviews of the Moto g and Men and no one has discusses a problem the the captive display adjustment how is this possible
 Now many others have the same problems
 Os Motorola planning a bug fix for this automatic display brightness
