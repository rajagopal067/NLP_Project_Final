 A strict os os if you go by my opinion and review
 The phone mid stopped working after 5 months of purchase
 I gave the phone at authorized service centres thrice but the mid stopped working after few days each time after servicing.
 In the third attempt even my motherboard was changed but the problem still persisted
 I wrote a mail to Motorola Customer Are on 24 April 2015 to which they responded by saying that a Repair Status Specialist Team will contact me within 48 hours
 It has been 8 days since then and two more email from my side but there is still no response from the Customer Are
 Flipkart may be doing a good job but I would warn everyone not to have any hopes from after sales services of Motorola.
 Incompetent service centres and worst customer care

 Sons 1. Almost same hardware as older motor even after releasing 1 year later
 2. Battery life is pathetic
 I have to look for charger every time I want to play a game
 The battery actually drains even if I play while charging Otherwise battery will empty within an hours
 its the single most pain point
 Have to use it carefully to last a day
 3. Charging the phone takes too long
 Several hours of charging for full battery
 4.
 Over prices for medium-end phone too much for the performance it offers
 5. Too much hope for fast OS(Lollipop) updated
 It released it nearly the same time as other companies.(Don't
 tell me in os they released it early Rose 1. Camera quality is better than last motor
 Its unable now
 2. Fig bright screen 3. Design Verdict I am utterly disappointed in how limiting the battery is
 You have to use it like a phone not a smartphone.
 There are better speed phone from other manufacturers now
 I am done with Motor

 Writing the review after using this phone for a months
 let me put it simple That I use my phone for - Listening music for 2 his clinking pick all round the day , playing games for at least 3hrs.
 Rose camera quality day and night both awesome got lollipop pre-updated best mid range phone worth the price has all goose apes preinstalled Sons dram saturated after 6hrs, need to do a ram clean up battery drains out a bit faster depends on how u save it Course -headphones' quality is good but the shape sucks things I hate is the built in music player it wont play a song after day needs restarted may be bug in the pp cannot download song directly

 from the day i got my phone i m facing the issue regarding battery and speaker Battery drains very early and sound quality is very bad while calling someone Secondly Motorola service is worse(Jaipur service center ) They gave me my phone in 14 days
 Within a month its motherboard is replaced and even after i am having the same issue
 To add it more after service , camera flash is also not working His battery and sound problem is very common and seeing their service i will highly recommend not to buy this phone

 I was waiting for this phone from long time since it came to market
 Finally the day has came to buy it through FlipKart.As i do always if i need to buy through online
 Some facts about this product after using for about a month now : 1.Moto G looks class in style with its design
 2.As mentioned its a water resistance i was stuck in rain few days before in bangalore and was able to use the phone after getting drained out partly in my pocket
 if you are listening to music through ear phone and you get a call in between by the time you plug the earphones from the jack and their goes you wont be able to hear the voice of the speaker from the other side but he can hear your voice guess its a bug that is making to switch off and with on to bring it back to normal condition everyday basis
 as I love to listen music
 4.Battery back up is not unto my expectation as per their specification
 its getting drained out in 8 to 10hrs if you keep listening to music and by launching some basic apes on phone
 speakers are good but by keeping more volume i guess the speakers would get ultimately damaged gradually
 it takes longer time to get charged completely through USB cable
 least 4hrs.
 graphics quality of the phone is superb as i love to watch moves in HD's...
 You could early play moves in .AVI, .MKV,MP4,MPGV,blueray os files as efficiently as you could watch in VLC or os player in your PC's.
 Finally I wont recommend anyone to buy or not to buy this products it has its own ports and sons

 In
 I wanted to buy a product which was suppose to be a real value for money
 There were few more option available in the market
 However decided to buy Moto G 2 because Motorola is one of the renowned company and moreover this OS is directly controlled by Google.
 I liked this products
 Black is nice and white is very class
 The configuration of this phone is very good if you are paying 11K.
 I did not find much issues with battery life however it will be a bit early to comment anything about this
 Camera quality is pretty decent
 West part is the internal memory and the built quality
 Does not lag at all
 Overall - Vice and value for money
 To for it if you are not very very heavy user
 Eating this device as 4 Star as I wanted to get the battery at least of 2900 mAh.

 I bought this phone around a month back and am using it since then .
 Gros : os Brilliant looks and feel really nice in palms .
 Such better than samson or Micromax Honest
 os To Lagging - Processor is fast enough .
 os Good Camera .
 Takes good click both from front and rear
 os Solid Built Quality - Of all the points above , this is the best think I like about this phone
 Sons : os Very average battery life .2100
 may is too low considering competitors provide better may in same prices
 os Though I do not play too many games .
 When playing high graphics game , phone became little heated after playing continuously for 30 mind
 Overall Verdict - Good choice at this Price .
 Of you change your phone every 1.5~2 yes , this is the one you shed go for rather than going for ask phone .

 I actually wanted to rate is 0 or intact os but unfortunately the option is not available
 2 days back I bought this product for 9899 and its pathetic to find out that Flipkart is giving defective products on sale
 I was so happy to order the product seeing the review for product but now I have lost trust in Flipkart.
 I will have to think twice before ordering any product on sale through flipkart.The phone screen gets heated in 5-10mins and its very difficult to even talk continuously for 5 mind
 Really upset with flipkart/motog.
 Wont know who to be blamed for it

 He bought moto go last month with April they gave offer discount of Rs.1000 total price is 11,999.
 Now this week they are giving another Rs.1000 for Rs.10,999.

 That is the real cost of the phone
 Why this much discount in a months

 There are some best phone under 15,000 category but best stock Android experience you are going to get with this device
 Initially thought of buying zen but after reading comments in flipkart i withdraw from the thought and i ordered MOTO 2ND GEN which i got lollipop updated you have to taste it believe me it is the best experience or going to get prose screen is good camera quality is decent build quality is top notch which you are not going to get with chinaphones last but not least LOLLIPOP you are going to love it icons only con is Average battery life

 By last purchase from flipkart.
 Now many times I have to call you ?
 And you saying that I have installed apes so battery getting drained , then why I have bought this mobile , just to keep it in box so I can see it everyday ?
 Of mobile can hold its battery with facebook and whatsapp why I need that mobile ?
 Total money waste and you taught me a good lessons
 Thank you Flipkart for your wonderful lessons

 But the phone itself is wondrous
 Motorola put its best in one kit with best price in the market
 When I bought it it was Os 13K.
 But Flipkart gave 10% off on every SBI debit card purchase which made me opening the phone kit merrier
 Very now and then Flipkart manages to keep its best product delivery system continuous

 His is the fourth moto g have ordered from Flipkart , the first two being a moto g 2013 models and the others are moto g second generations
 The other 2014 model was for my relative and it is working fine
 The phone I got has a strong green tinge in the display.Upon requesting for a replacement , teach from flipkart said that they will be sending link for a smart check pp to test the phone and will receive a call back from another teach for follow up in 4hrs.
 There was no link sent yet despite contracting them twice
 him looking my trust over Flpkart as a reliable source for buying Motorolla products.Giving wrong information to customer and giving faulty promises which you canst keep is not good customer service by Flipkart and Motorolla.

 I purchased this mobile from flipkart and got it delivered the next day ( on additional charges from the moment i got it , the mobile kept on reporting after a different time intervals
 I applied for return and flipkart with its great solution providing team gave me all support
 To solution seem to sort it out
 I checked the net on why this was happening
 I found out that the lollipop is very unstable and has its own issues
 The teach team of flipkart forgot to tell this to me or would have thought that i would not buy it
 That ever measure flipkart took was just some factory rest and ache clearance which any tom dick and harry does
 Did not expect this from flipkart.
 Us kindly understand that you are customers are educated and they need it know this
 By sincere advise is that people before you buy any plain vanilla goose os devices remember to check whether the os is stable
 because flipkart accepts devices only if there are any hardware defects for replacement
 To not be fooled

 In i am writing this review after using this for one months
 it is straight away coming with the lollypop OS. as a moto product it is nicely working
 after using of 15 days am getting battery charging issue
 i think now a days every one while the starting days of buying this phone may got the charging issue
 Because there are so many moto built in apes will run in background
 for me its created lot of issues it is takes to full charge for 6 hours
 but it is getting drained by 5 hours
 i have raised for return the products but the flipkart product expect Days that we have to charge fully every time in the starting days and asked me to stop all the unnecessary apes which are running in the back ground
 now the battery is coming more than 12 hours
 over all the product is nice

 Very disappointed with the service or support that Motorola had to offer
 I received a faulty piece which overheard when charged and voice echoes back for the person at the other end

 When I pushed they asked me to visit a service centre which are normally located at Wars and where people dont pick up their phone

 Dear Buyers please be aware of 30 days replacement warranty
 Flipkart will not replace your products
 I had an issue with my Moto G in Men within 10 days of purchase because of battery issue
 I was asked to update saw
 Worked for a few days
 Updated OS as well
 Still there problems
 Basically phone has a problems
 Flipkart pushed the problem beyond 30 days with temporary fix and now they say as per policy 30 days time period is over
 You will be asked to go to the service center
 hats the only support you can expect
 In top of it they accuse you of not handling the phone right with their assumptions
 They also question your integrity by asking hypothetical question like what would you do if your phone went wrong in 3 months - will you still ask for replacement
 what sort of question is that
 Isn’t it ridiculous
 Flipkart gave me a defeated piece and expect me to go to the service center to fix the problems
 When you pay Os 13000 for a product and if the product has problems within 10 days isn it fair to replace the product unless there an external damaged
 Why should one struggle to fix the software problems and go to service centers to get the problem fixed
 Must accept the phone has a problem and replace it

 First of all being a FLIPKART FIRST member got next day delivery thanks
 Superb phone with all features listed on site
 A perfect feet os inch screen
 was 5.5 inch screens are too big for pockets!!.) Lolipop is a lovely operating system.Toady is first day with phone and am enjoying
 The major plus is sound - the sterno effect is unbearable of MOTO-G, superb quality
 Deep up the good work Motorola and Flipkart.
 I have two observation about products
 a Despite being LOLIPOP - no support for indian Gujarati language
 other local Legs give the same by Front camera is not up to the mark
 The best part was MOTO MIGRATE from MOTO E first generation to MOTO Os the way the data was shifted on wife within 20 minutes - it was amazing.!!

 Heating issues are there in mobile when we use more than 20 to 30 minutes
 To not go for MOTo G2.
 With this price we will very good brand mobile in the market
 I have requested for replacement for many time within a 30 days warranty period but they do not respond till my warranty get expired
 Technical team also not resolved my issue simply they said that heating issues are very common in smart phones.FLIPKART is really worst and worst customer care in all online portal because they did respond to me till my Return policy over
 Please do not take any products from FLIPKART.We canst be-leave FLIPKART.

 Flipkart is not good one at all

 By phone is just one month old...i appreciate flipkart service for their quick delivery The problem with my phone is I can see the callers number and images while my phone is ringing..the display appears black..so i dont know who is calling..then what is the purpose of having this phone....i have to clock the phone to see who is calling by pressing power button...i contracted moto help but their service is not good...
 To guns at this price lot of new phone with good configuration is available... my simple advice is dont go for it when it didn fulfilled the basic function of a phone

 The quality finish aesthetic and overall features of this phone is excellent
 You can ask for more
 The only issue I had was barely after 15 days the price was slashed by Os sky
 But that is what is happening all the time now a days
 You win some and you lose some

 I always prefer flipkart to buy any product reason they provide good service,Genuine product,delivering product is before date and important indian webster About Moto G and generation it was very mobile within new price 10999 no other product i am finding good with such specification
 Screen is very good,nice display.back
 camera is good,front camera is not unto that mark,good signal strength,3G working faster and battery is 2070Mah which is little disadvantage but for this price it was good if compare other specification
 Over all product is nice and delivery is faster appreciated

 I had been looking for a right mix of performance looks power and inaccessibility for a long time
 I had tried my hands on touch screen phone a Samsung and a Sonya but never could decide of them to be replacement for my Blackberry.
 Moto G succeeded in winning my confidence after almost 3 years
 His is absolute value for money
 Unless you are not being covertly nasty with it it will stay faithful and will not let you down

 The MOTO G second generation white colour mobile I have purchased from Flipkart for 12999/- for my spouse and it is a master piece to possess
 Though I have later purchased Desire EYE from Dubai, the photos from MOTO Os is so great and very nice skin tone quality comparable to my DSLR camera
 It is a very perfectly prices cheaper than for its contents and quality

 Never had ever encountered such a buyer unfriendly company
 The last time I bought a phone Samsung GT-S7562, its performance was worst in every department when compared it with same phone but bought from brick and mortar shops
 The history has repeated itself again and I am finding this new phone also behaving so erratically
 I have found the phone hanging on so many occasions
 The sound suddenly lips during the middle of songs and then recovers
 The camera is also not very good
 The phone has already become slow within a span of just 30 days
 Now when I want to return the product , they are denying and making sure that I go through all sorts of harrasment.

 Battery required 10 hours to charge fully

 Heard from friends that the old phone doesn have any of these issues

 I know the product is good as I have ordered it twice for my friends
 I was trying to order the mobile today - 29/04/15 using the 15% OFF + 10% OFF on SBI Isa cards for MOTO honest
 I was unhappy to see that the offer was removed prior to its expire date - 29/04/2015.
 I have even called the Customer care guy to check out the same but he is simply answering that the offer was updated
 He is certainly trained not to answer my question that - Why the offer was removed before its expire ???

 Although the offers from Hittel are face Hittel is real theater
 I wasted an hour on customer care but their offer data is not created on my not

 When I now paid for Os data its showing only Os data credited.

 With Xiaomi phone not made available for general public with their show off flash sales I decided to purchase the Moto G(2nd genet
 His hands from the time of launch is still readily available on flipkart os I liked the hands look feel and overall aspects
 The Sterno speakers Camera and additional storage are the biggest upgrade over the previous honest
 The only con in this phone is the very average battery life
 Of one is a regular user of the phone for browsing whatsapp, etc several times a day I feel the battery will drain out in about 8-10 hours
 Overall very much satisfied … i booked phone on 22/04/15 got it on 23/04/15 good service and price is 12000/- after one week idea today(28/04/15) the price come down to 10000/- i lost Os 2000/- just because of the flipkart customer care people
 before booking the phone i took an advice by failing and by phone
 but they said by phone that we dont know
 they not even respond my mail.relay,
 they dont know what offer is going rite now what may come in future
 if they know also they will not guide us
 really am feeling very..... bad
 if there is any way to help me kindly do the needful please..................................

 I am being forced to write this review because of the absolutely pathetic response i am getting from FLIPKART | os Detail for the issues faced on this device
 I will be completing a month today and its troubling me since the day i bought it
 Round a week back i raised a request for return of this device but they disapproved it after some stupid troubleshooting steps
 3 days back i raised request for return again as the device is still behaving badly but till date no response from flipkart.
 I have been facing the following issues with this device - Battery not charged properly stays on x for hours(need to start to increase the os - Sometimes when u remove charging it shows the battery is still charging - Hangs and auto starts on playing video on for couture - All disconnected automatically - Very slow touch response

 Now Amazing smartphone.Complete value for money
 Rose Amazing camera(Both camera having very good even in low light and Indoor lighting conditions
 Amazing display Large memory Latest Android 5.0 (Lollipop).
 few Bloatwares.
 Sons Average battery life(For power users High radiation even in single him os os Os can feel skin irritation even when I touch the phone after prolonged usage
 High display spare cost
 Of u break the display it would cost about 7,000/-).
 Charger gets hot while charging
 Now quality headset(but this is not a matter when compared to phone
 Also in Moto service center people are waiting for hours to claim warranties because of less service center and many problems in the phone
 PREGNANT LADIES AND HEART PATIENTS (WITH PACE MAKERS) PLS DON'T PREFER THIS PHONE.

 Ought this hands after returning Bony Peri Os and Micromax Canvas Night A350.
 Both returned in 10 days from the date of purchase
 But this Moto Os is something different than today smartphone era
 Good part is it automatically upgrade to Lolipop, latest Android version
 Seeing the look and feel you wouldn mind paying ll extra
 A good design
 Functionality wise phone is above average
 Works faster when have only factory software
 In adding new apes and running multiple apes simultaneously slow down the phone notably
 Camera primary and secondary is absolutely satisfactory
 War Piece should have been better
 It doesn fit well thought
 To for it

 Friends dont buy this phone
 The only reason is there is no Service
 Sharing my experience and I am resident of Mumbai.
 Ought Moto G and gen from flipkart.
 The delivery was made after 5 days of order
 After only two months of use my phone display got blank with no reason
 By findings are 1.
 There are no authorized service centers
 2. whereas only one service center called B2X located far off Suburbs with total staff of people
 3. From past days I am following up
 Only response I am getting is The cannot do anything the part is not dispatched from there some location in Chennai".
 4. They dont know when it will get dispatched and when they will be able to give me back
 In this age of Service I would rate this product a total failure
 wont buy because you are not going to get any service
 Choice is yours

 Us this is the best andros mobile available in the market
 Motorola has done good job in bringing these gem in unfordable prices
 I purchased it at Os 11000 and at this price is is steal
 I know there are few companies like Xiaomi, Asus, Novo who have released mobile with better speck in better price but Moto G looks very expensive and smooth as compared to Zenphones, os & Lenovo.
 Last but not the least in terms of brand Motorola is far far far ahead then these bands

 calls and complains were made to flipkart but still my issue was not solved nor did I get any replacement In with April I received a call from your product specialist was I was busy I requested him to call me after 30 minutes The assured a call the very next dayton with April Os did not receive any call from your side Os again called the customer care executive and then again he assured me of a call back the very next day was expected a still I did not receive any call on with April as well .
 In with April I received a message stating my return request was rejected Again a call was made on with your customer care executive kept assuring of a call back the very next day Surprisingly its with today and I still haven Received any call back from your end .
 Finally I have requested for an replacement or an refund on 27/5/2015 even after his I did not receive any message or email confirming that my requested has been taken unlike it is always given Again I called customer care service and they were helpless,all they said is they have taken a complain for the same which I have been hearing everyday without any outcome of the same All this while I did not receive any message or email confirming that my complain/request has been taken nor any message stating the time when I shall receive a call from your product Specialist

 First one was with earphone, which easily replaced with another
 To I was having good trust in flipkart about the return policy
 But this this time Am really frustrated
 Not phone which has problem with speaker
 Requested return customer care asked to install an pp
 They told they will be calling next day and will give PIN no to remote accepting the phone
 Next day got a call and he told rest the phone it will be okay
 Return request rejected
 Beset phone but still having the issue
 Very next day battery also started draining fast
 Again requested return same repeated
 Installed the Pp wait for the PIN.
 Next day customer care called and told to update phone (OS) software
 Since I dont have very speed internet I canst update the phone
 I told them to give the PIN and they told me after dating the phone only they can check
 After many request he accepted but for the PIN I have to another day
 Since many of funds suggested Moto G and Men is good phone
 Some of them using happily
 I have checked the seller WSRetail.

 You are getting an awesome phone at a low price range .
 It has an excellent body finish pretty good while holding did not feel cheap interest of looking primary camera takes pretty good shots specially in the outdoor conditions heavy games can be played smoothly it with multiple games at the same time it can hang for a moment or so cause of its 1GB ram .
 sons are its heating issue the temperature can raise unto 46 C which can be felt easily after 10 or 15 min of heavy usage .
 and the battery life is also not that good with a screen time of about 5 to 6 hours which is pretty enough for a whole day .
 After all its a good phone in this price range it surely there are much better option but if u want a premium phone at this price than just go for it .

 I got the phone on time and used it for ten days
 The phone got stuck at loading screen and was not able to boots
 Contracted flipkart, they replaced it with other piece
 After using it for a months the speaker got damaged
 I need to rush to the service center they took fifteen days to replace the part as it is not readily available
 After a week or so the phone started again hanging and gets heated up very often
 Red up of rushing to the service center every time I bought hawaii honor holly which is pretty much fast and I am still using it with out any problems
 The phone motherboard is changed was informed by the service center
 Now out of 10 calls you make every th call the other person cannot here your voice
 Os you have to close the call and initiate again
 I dont know how much time it will take again
 Even the service center people are not fast in solving the problems
 Os my sincere advise is better not to buy this one
 And after all you are prepared to buy it also be prepared to buy one more phone as you have to rush to the service enter every time
 Even the upgrade andros lollipop is not unto the mark
 It needs plenty of updated
 Features like call block list etc are missing compared to competitors
 I have seen a lot of users of moto coming to the service centers with same kind of issues
 To dare to buy this and feel free to loose your hard earned money

 I was planning to buy my first smartphone, did a lot of analysis and browed through so many reviews and finally penalized Moto G and Men which is in my price range really good looking phone with latest andros updated available
 Shone is really have a competitive price compared to other brand phone with the same configuration navigation of the phone is really smooth

 I have been using this for the past few months , The Only good thing when compared to other low end mobile is voice clarity response to Touch is horrible and this went to worse when upgrade .
 Any starts to come back to normal Need to wait after touch to call anyone It is just as normal smart phone

 I have purchased two moto g and Men mobile lip part
 Processor of mobile is good
 Picture quality is very nice
 Screen size speaker features are very good
 Speed of delivery is very fast
 Next day I received mobile after placing order
 One drawback I want to notice radiation of waves is very high.When we use to talk long time or use multiple operations more heat is generating.
 Battery Life is very less if you are using Os network you need to charge twice in a day

 I got the phone just one week ago...within these days i faced no issues regarding the device or any malfunctions.
 The phone has some built features provided by Motorola..like Moto Assist and Moto Alert which makes the phone unique
 Its camera quality is excellent(both rear and front smooth touch awesome display and resolution light weight
 But the headset sound needs to be improved
 its not so good
 Probably ill buy another headset of other brand like JBL.
 Part from this particular issue the phone is really excellent
 I am satisfied

 Its my first smart phone
 It was working with mitka andros but as it upgrade with lollypop its performance degraded a little.Its rear camera is too good capture damn good quality picture and shoot video also
 It look also good
 But its accessories are not as good as mobile you have to place order for the another earphone if you like music
 Over all we can not get any other brand smart phone in this price.... To for it

 i bought a moto g 2 almost 6 months back for my mother... it was defective
 In the beginning we didn realise it but later when we realised we gave it to our nearest motorola service centre they said they would return it in 6-7 days instead they returned us back after one months Also the number which they gave us was wrong Another number nobody would pick... and now when we got back our phone it is more defective... earlier the call would cut itself while talking in between... n now we are unable to receive calls of anybody... also if we call to somebody it cuts itself in between the conversation...THESE GUYS HAVE VERY PATHETIC SERVICE...
 I WILL NEVER SUGGEST ANYBODY os BUY MOTOROLA PRODUCTS.. THE SERVICE CENTRES PROVIDE REALLY POOR SERVICES.. THIS os NOT TOLERABLE..

 Ought this mobile 3 months back from FLIPKART, thanks to its fabulous service got my hands within 3 days
 Have been using this since then & i am totally satisfied with dis handset.
 Though I am a new user of Moto so was resistant initially but cell is more than what i was expecting
 Comparatively good battery back ( os day with normal use of gazing calling,net surging & using whatsapp) ; camera quality s good
 All in all it s best cell in this price segment

YASH DEDHIA
 Ought this phone in November 2014 & reviewing now after 5 months... First of all pointing out the advantages of the phone... os Considering the pricking of d phone at ask with brand name Motorola attached,... i would say its a bang for buck at this price...Yes there are great competitors like Us zenfone 2 a most budget flagship device but you can never ignore a brand name & its quality & durability... os Coming to the interface provided by Google..(Google now launched with andros latest lollipop 5.0.2 its a great combination providing butter smooth interface os great features..plus its capable of getting 5.1 update which has all bug fixes to lollipop... os With 1 os of ram it is capable of playing all high end games like Shalt os Head trigger 1/2, Modern combat os brother in arms 3 etc
 To issues with that it still if you are a hardware game go with phone packed up with 2GB Am for smooth high end play os Lollipop greatest benefit is the ram management it provides i can surely notice the smoothness it delivers than mitka n experienced smooth playback on games also os Shone is capable of playing Full os video with the help of all player easily no laws as such os Coming to the camera the back camera packed up with 8 up shorter is just amazing provides good color combination images... n rear front facing camera 2 up is also good..(not a great camera user still you can check other reviews you.ll
 find good reviews about camera... os A much needed thing fr any phone for me is footing it... provides tone of customization's with custom rooms + recently cm12.1 ( 5.1 update ) type custom Tom has been released which is great thing... with exposed framework for lollipop..
 To there
 no doubt you,ll get bored about it... Coming to some noticeable disadvantages os The battery is not removable which makes it a problem to have a visit to service center if some problem occurs os The battery back of d phone on standby is great Up in that but then if u use it for hardware gaming with WiFi/mobile data continuous usage u wont b happy then os him a average user - os USAGE STATS ARE MOSTLY - iii on whole time for what pp Instagram, Facebook & decent gaming - His usage provides me around 10-11 hours of battery back with screen on-time usage of around 4 his min or 5 hours which is no doubt great thing when u use net dont expect battery to b great...
 To guns a last thing to say if u looking out for budget smartphone provided by goose with regular updated + brand-name+ casual gaming + quality and disability this for you... ITS SAID ALWAYS PHONE WITH SPECS THAT COMES os PAPER N PRACTICAL USAGE TRUE os A GOOD ONE... YOU'll FIND GOOD BUDGET PHONES MARKED WITH GREAT SPECS NOWADAYS.. BUT os SURE os SEE ITS GOOD os PRACTICAL USE ALSO.. DON'T JUST os FOR SPECS BUT SEE QUALITY + DURABILITY = LONG LIFE SAVINGS os PHONE..

 I took delivery of the Moto G and Men on Oct'14 with great excitement !
 But from the very beginning it started giving problem with "connectivity", both net on & net off
 I am a regular customer of this company But they didn bother either to replace or repair the set at all
 I am totally frustrated & thought It would have been better to throw Os 13000 to river Ranges instead of investing in this products
 His is very unfortunate that Flipkart never care for the after sales services to their customers

ASHISH BHATT
 To not go for this products I am having lots of problem like hanging heating and poor battery back with this device Even flipkart customer support is not useful any more The do not rely what problems i am facing
 They just cheque my phone status with some pp online and responded device is working properly
 Maximum heating hemp is 45 and my device is around 42 or 43, but they are oh with that
 I canst place phone close to my ear due to heating problem but flipkart is ok with that because pp does not show them phone is heating
 Hanging is another issue with this device When you try to call any no u can dial in one shot or receive most of the time call
 Screen goes blank every time
 I will prefer to buy micromax max mobile from any other site,because if you buy from flipkart and any problem occur with that then they will not help you,,, Wastage of money
 dont make mistake like me...

 I order this phone on with april got it on with april a little bit later
 Some to the phone
 The phone is Simply Awesome.
 Screen is Fabulous,Very Recent Great Resolution you can easily see it in sunlight
 Camera is also great but i feel some problem in low light but its awesome in light its focus is brilliant,flash is also not so bright as compared to other like samsung, sony,etc.
 Front camera is awesome very clear pictures even in low light
 Lollipop is also good but the goose now launched i hate its white background at pp drawer
 Round is very pretty
 Performance is very good,very smooth graphics are also good
 The Biggest problem of this phone is its Battery
 Battery takes a 4 hour to full charge and only runs 6-8 his and if u are using the g network then it runs only 5-6 hrs.But if you dont use your phone continuously then battery is not a major problem to you there one another problem is its HEAT, Sometimes you even cannot touch it to your ears
 But Overall its West phone under 15k.

 USING PHONE SINCE LAST 1 week ITS NOT JUST PROS AND CONS , ITS PRO'S, OK'S AND CON'S PROS: 1. GOOD AND FAST PROCESSOR - os LAG 2. CALL QUALITY TOP NOTCH WITH NOISE CANCELLING 3. PURE KITKAT WITH GUARANTEED " L " UPGRADE.
 4. LOW LIGHT PICTURES os CAMERA EXTEREMLY GOOD. 5. LAST BUT NOT LEAST - SOLID BUILD QUALITY.
 6. EXPANDABLE MEMORY.
 OK'S 1.SCREEN PPI AND COLOR VIVIDNESS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
 2. CAMERA NOT THAT TOP NOTCH BUT NOT COMPLAINABLE.-GOOD
 FOR THIS PRICE RANGE 3. FRONT SPEAKERS- MANY PEOPLE PRAISE ABOUT THE FRONT SPEAKERS , BUT os REALLY os NOT THAT LOUD, THIS os os 5 os PHONE os 3 YEARS AND os I CAN EASILY FIND THE DIFFERENCE. 4. MUSIC AND SOUND OUTPUT QUALITY NOT GREAT BUT OK, EVEN WITH HEADPHONES. 5. FINGER PRINT MAGNET BACK COVER.
 6. BACK PANEL LITTLE SLIPPERY.
 7. FOR SOME HIGH END GAMES PROCESSOR HAS SOME LAG. 8. COULD HAVE DONE WITH A BETTER CUSTOMIZED UI , STOCK ANDROID (EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST KITKAT) FEELS VERY CHEAP AND NOTHING SPECIAL.
 BUT THIS CAN os OVERCOME os PURCHASING EVERYTHING os LAUNCHER os THEMER APP WHICH os THE GREATEST os UI CUSTOMIZATION HOME REPLACEMENT AVAILABLE TODAY os ANDROID STORE.
 CON'S 1. THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS os os DEFAULT WITHOUT BRIGHTENING os TOO TOO LOW , EVEN FOR INDOORS os A HALF LIT ROOM.
 JUST INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS os ONE POINT AND EVERY THING os FINE. 2. os DLNA AND NFC. 3. NOT A VERY GOOD AUDIO CODEC.
 4. LAST BUT NOT LEAST , BULL SHIT EAR PHONES, COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITH JBL os EARS.
 SUGGESTIONS: 1. COULD HAVE DONE WITH os MORE GRIPPIER BACK PANEL.
 2. A BETTER HEADPHONES. 3. COMPLETELY CLOSED FRONT DUAL SPEAKER VALLEYS.
 os YOU KEEP THE PHONE DIRECTLY UNDER A LIGHT AND LOOK os THE EDGE os THE SPEAKERS YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND THE BOTTOM FROM WHERE THE SPEAKER EMERGES, NOW THIS SMALL GAP CAN os PRONE os DUST AND SWEAT WHICH CAN os INSIDE.
 4. USB PLUG-GABLE CHARGING PLUG.
 5.3000 MAH BATTERY.
 THATS IT, FINALLY os os A GOOD PHONE, EVERY THING HAS ITS PROS AND CONS, WELL YOU CANT EXPECT GALAXY Os ALPHA FEATURES AND SELL FOR 13 Os BUT WORLDS FIRST MOBILE PHONE MANUFACTURER AND POWERFULL ANDROID MAKES DEADLY COMBINATION, THERE ARE PHONES LIKE KARBONN, ALCATEL, XIAOMI Os WHICH MAY HAVE DOUBLE SPECS AND SELL os THE SAME RATE os SLIGHTLY HIGHER.
 BUT CANNOT os COUNTED FOR ENDURANCE.
 BECAUSE os 4 YEAR OLD MOTOROLA ATRIX Os STILL SMOKES SOME os TODAY'S NEW AND GOOD PHONES FROM TOP MAJOR INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURERS os ALMOST EVERY RESPECT.
 HENCE os OPINION """"" GOOD DEAL """.

 I have received a defective product and my replacement request is rejected
 Within 2 days of the delivery of the Moto G2, it has started hanging
 I kept on following up with must care only to hear that my return request is rejected
 The phone still hangs intermittently especially when i try to receive the calls and make calls
 It is very frustration for me as I had given it as a gift
 I am giving one star for flipkart's poor must service and 30 days return policy which did not work in my cases
 Finally I have given up with Flipkart and decided to go directly to the Moto must care

 I was excited for this phone and expected a lot out of it
 However the processor performance takes a toll if you are trying to do some heavy stuff like downloading something and then playing a low consumption game at the same time
 its just ok phone dont be super excited about it
 Saying 13K , its worth maybe little bit less

 It this phone I dont think you canst get better deal than this

 Motorola along with its service center is running Fraud Service to Snatch Customers
 Instead to replace defective micro-usb port for a running mobile they forces to replace motherboard that also with doctor motherboard but with higher cost
 And calling customer to come another day to have original IMEI Os restored so that they can repair the original motherboard and prefix it but with higher cost
 Detail of my experience IMPORTANT: I have restored the original motherboard with non-branded Technician (road-side).
 FRAUD DETAIL: 1.
 In 22Feb2015 my MOTO G2’s micro us port was damaged though set was working
 Met IMEI Os (1) 353321065372446, and (2) 353321065372453.
 2. In 23Feb2015 morning I approached said service center
 They received the defective set and advised me to come at evening
 They also told that I needed to pay Os 900/- to changes
 But they had issued no receipt on the pretext of their printer became out of order
 3.
 Os I approached them on evening of 23Feb2015, they told that I have to change the motherboard for Rs.5000/-.
 Os I countered that the set was working and micro us port is easily replaceable that I knew from other bands experience they told that they had no such expertise
 4. Being a busy person it is difficult for me to live without a smart phone
 Were it may be mentioned that I am using Motorola smart phone starting from Q9h, MilestoneA853 and now moto-G2, motor and also ASUS Zenfone 5. 5.
 I gave consent to change the mother board
 6.
 They changed the motherboard but refused to return old mother board
 They also advised that I had to return with my Moto-G2 on 28Feb2015 to have IMEI not
 restored
 They had not issued a detail legal VAT paid bill
 Instead they gave a money receipt for Rs.5000/-.
 The receipt has header in the name other than name registered in online service center search But With Same Address
 7. I was exhausted at a horrible day end without mobile
 I had failed to check the mobile in details
 But on counting a lot I took back the old motherboard as my property
 8. In returning home I took the help of Internet and realized the fraud in details
 The new motherboard is of outdated Samsung phone identified with IMEI not
 (1) 353325060920083, and (2) 353325060920091.
 His explains that the said service center to give me relief a little changed the mother board and tried to keep the original motherboard.
 They would change the defective micro-usb port and refined it if I had approached them on 28Feb2015 on the pretext of restoring IMEI not
 They also kept my Defective charger on the pretext of replacing it on 28Feb2015.
 They mentioned this on the reverse of the money receipt
 9. Also so called new motherboard has defective micro-usb.
 To I cannot charge it
 It is now brick
 11.
 Their plan was to repair my original motherboard and to prefix it on the pretext of restoring IMEI not on 28 FEB.
 10.
 Instead I lodged complains in online Motorola service help
 Def Complain not
 #150224-092121 and #150224-029100.
 But I have not got any fruitful answer from these
 Motorola Online Help is speaking in favor of their service center
 11.
 IMPORTANT: I restored the original motherboard after replacing micro-usb port through a non-branded road side technician.
 For this He charged Rs.300/- for us port replacement and Os
 1100/- for motherboard re-fabrication.

 I have purchased this from 1 months ago and found there have so many problem regarding battery
 Which drain very past during net use it does only work 2-3 hours if we are using Os connection.Accessories section they did not provide data cable so this is major draw back of this section and also for headset quality is not good
 Camera is ok but not match photo quality with redmi.So I will be advise please dont purchase this.Totally money waste of this kind of mobile.If Flipkart will back my 70% money I would be happy
 Of this will not support Os then it will be totally cheat us by FlipKart because so many current phone are working on this way
 Thanks

 I Ought this mobile just for Os 9900/- I searched all other models and finally purchased this when Flipkart give offer on mobile pp flat Os 2000/- off and 10% discount with AXIS bank Credit cards
 I am enjoying allot with this
 yes : Gaming is too good
 Chatting with friends easy because of big display
 Shone performance is too fast for my usage
 Display is more than enough for me
 Feeling so luxurious
 Some over i found
 Battery is not standing for long time
 Camera clarity is little bit dull when compare with Samsung Os neo

 I feel to review a product you have to use it well
 I bought Moto G in month of Oct'14 so its with me for around 6 months
 Prior to Moto Os i had used Samsung Galaxy Os for 3 years
 For 3 years I never faced any issue with the Os phone except battery drainage or slowness which used to get resolved on resecting the phone again
 I had to replace the Os battery 2 times during this period
 For MotoG, I have faced the following issues within 6 months 1. Touch screen started giving issues sometimes touch doesn work for certain areas
 2. The charger has stopped working
 I am using another charger now
 3.
 Any times people calling me get message that the phone is out of coverage or unteachable when it is showing the full signals to me
 Conclusion - Shone is cheaper than competitors but it is not a unable phone
 Not recommended

 Does not hang for any apes or games as of now including asphalt).
 Battery does not get heat too much as others say
 Os see little stinginess with tooooo many apes running and internet in turned on....but this is not at all an issueeee in this phone
 Good look and design
 Sons Battery is not good since only 2070 MAH....but lasts for a day almost with g enabled
 May if u put live wallpaper it lasts for 4 hrs.:(
 Os missed offer from flipakrt, where it was sold for 11000 through mobile app,,,It is realyyyy worth phone for 11k.

 Compared to other phone with flat designs Motorola has given Moto Os a curved one which results in a firm grip along with a 'semi-rubber' back
 And due to the gorilla glass the Moto Os is much more unable than other honest
 And the features... this includes all the main features like expandable storage 1GB RAM, dual front facing speakers etc all this in a 5 inch phone with a 1.2 z quad-core processor phone
 Camera quality is also good
 Frankly in my opinion Motorola is one of the company which gives you an assured quality
 That is why it is good to spend some extra k to get a phone with almost the same specification but better rating
 That is what a smart buyer will always do

 Though the phone claims to have gorilla glass 3 , my moto g screen is broken after 6 months
 Of you want to replace screen you need to pay 7K, May be Moto is selling substandard quality phone to Indian customers
 I am going to buy a new phone , but not from Moto any more

 good phone good feel and great speed
 the only con is that the charger is sub-standard.
 the charger gets heated will charging
 ear phone are just bakwassssss.
 the phone is good
 if you are a little good with your usage battery is also fine enough the back covers can be replaced
 but currently they are out of stock... Flipkart when will they be available??? the ones that are from motorola itself... not the cheap duplicate ones..??

 giving review with pro and sons ; pro : splash proof water resistant , easily we can get one day battery back up , decent camera , front sterno speakers non removable battery smooth design finish and pure andros updated by goose this is most important for andros lovers os sons : no indication symbols Os Os on ear phone , no data cable in box very disappointed taking 2 to 3 hours to charge 100 % os go ram is not enough , at least 2 go ram should be provided already system using 500 mb ram approximately the display is hard to see when using outside so we should increase brightness to full for clear viewing when using outside , near speakers there is some gap so dust can easily get in , i hope next version Moto Os will upgrade design of speakers and improve in hardware aspects !!! final verdict go for it or wait for moto Os !!!

 Eye its been a week that I am using Moto G os and so far I had a fair experience
 The weight of the phone is not much
 You can grip it easily because the back cover has a matter finish
 The display is good and touch is amazing
 His phone comes with an updated version of android, Lollipop.
 I am not a hard core camera
 I have lots of apes installed and the phone works pretty well
 But recently have started facing a little last and its probably because of the Lollipop version
 The camera are pretty decent
 I am a self adduct and the front cam works well for me
 A special feature is the "Slomo" allows you to record video in slow motion
 The speakers are in the front which increases the sound clarity
 To now even if you place the phone back side down your music wont get disturbed
 To its all about prose
 The only thing I dislike about this phone is that it has built battery
 To if you are satisfied with these pro and con you can opt for it
 I am satisfied with the purchase
 os

 I am writing this review after using the phone for 3 months
 Its my first smartphone and it turned out to be a nice one
 the display is brilliant phone shows no sign of lag on moderate use
 there is some heating issues especially when i surf net while charging but the phone tools down really fast
 The lollipop upgrade is fantastic it has really boasted the battery life which last a day on moderate use...if you are looking for your st smartphone then go for it
 you will be happy with your decision...

 I Ordered this phone on with November and got it within 2 days
 but the phone i received had a problem with camera and ear honest so i asked for a replacement and got it soon than to flipkart for that making it soon and fast
 Now the replaced phone was working fine for 2 months and after that problem started os Shone got switched off automatically and i took it to an authorized service centre the told its a mother board problem we have to replace it i told ok and the time given was 7 to 10 days and they nearly took 30 days to give it back this was one of the problems
 os After i took it from there may be a week it was fine and primary camera was not fine dis time and again i took it to service centre they told we have to replace camera within 3 to 4 days we will give it back but after a week they told we have to replace mother board and camera again and they took nearly 10 days again
 os Now after days i asked them without giving my mobile back they told touched is not working sir we have to replace it again
 Finally what i got to know was better go with any other products than motorola, because at least thy provide good service and give good response to the customers
 Really a waste product and a face company MOTOROLA.

Shivang Tripathi
 His phone takes really long time to charge to full which is around 6-7 hours
 After 1 month of use the phone is not charging with the charger which came along with the phone but charges with other similar charges but charging is really very slow
 I contracted motorola customer care and visited them
 Their response was surprising
 They said the problem is because of the some pp and I need to identify that pp and remove it
 Of that would have been the case then it should charge with any charge
 Money wasted

 Negative points 1. Battery back up is worst when internet is on
 Like the ridiculous advertisement I have to carry my charger all the time
 2. st It was running smoothly but started hanging frequently after and or rd software updated
 Now each time when I try to operate is quickly it got hanged
 3. secondary camera is not up to the mark
 4. Round quality is so so
 Positive points 1.
 It comes with 16GB internal memory which is generally enough to stores
 2. Any useful features like Moto Assist , Alert etc 3.
 Primary camera is 8 Pal which is quite good

Rahul Bangia
 I am not a fan of large handiest and the ones that best fit the hand are generally 4.3 - 4.5 inch
 Since Moto Os has a 5 inch display its not easy to fit into pocket and that especially for ladies
 Ought this phone for my wife and we are overall very happy with the products
 The quality is perfect from all perspective
 His is just similar to Samsung Galaxy Os in terms of configuration idea 1 os RAM, 8 os rear camera 2 os front camera and 16 os of internal memory
 Motorola has prices it perfectly and you dont feel created at all like in other companies where the MRP of you phone itself has gone down 30-40% in a years
 You will obviously feel created and wont the products again especially from companies like Samsung.
 Previous to this we have also used couple of Cava handiest as well in order to get high speck phone at low cost and have smeared never to go back to bands like Naval Micromax and others
 Of you are running on budget close your eyes and buy this phone and you will never be disappointed except for large screen
 The speck maybe lower than MMX, Cava and all but the performance and longevity is what you get instead of those face speck where cheap hardware is used

 Good things in MOto g second generation .
 1. look is just awesome, feels so premium
 2. 16 go internal memory is one add on 3. sound quality is amazing
 4. expandable slot unto 32 go which is god Had things : 1. battery sucks if you use internet continuously it will drain in 5 hours .
 its should have been 2500 may or 3000 may
 battery is big drawback in this phone .
 The person who is looking for good battery back up this phone is not for them .
 2. battery takes 3.5 hours to get charge fully , it sounds like i am charging phone more than i am using it .
 3. and no customization's so same boring andros .
 4. For someone who doesn care about looks XiOMI red note g is good .

 The original Moto G was Motorola's best-selling phone every and remains the only phone weave given 8/10.

 I have got Moto G and Men through Flipkart and on the same May its started to give problem like its heated up like often rock taking 16-17 hours to full battery charge its Picture quality and LED flash is so poor in compare to other lower cost mobile Pictures are with reddish shade
 when i contracted Flipkart customer care on with April they routed me through their technical team and now they are making if and but to refund my money and asking for trouble shooting etc etc but will not return my money
 it clearly stated in Flipkart return policy that if product is not unto mark than they will return whole money including delivery and packing charges but now they are saying its not applicable for electronics item and they will not refund
 than why they mentioned there return policy on their web simply can stated that they will not refund any money for Electronics item
 Os per them i have to read some other warranty terms which are hide in a very tiny question mark in last of product details
 i got very funny expert comments from Flipkart technical team that heating of phone is a common phenomena and they can do anything
 I have used 6 to 7 types of mobile in past years but have not faced this common phenomena in any phone and even my friends and relatives also didn face the same
 Their second expert opinion was that I have to close the background applications 3-4 times a day to keep the phone cool
 I salute to their expertise
 I dont know anyone who is wasting his time to do the same everyday so his phone can work properly while its a new phone and dont have any new applications except pre installed apply
 Flipkart is making fools to every customers
 so friends be aware before making any transactions with Flipkart.

 There was problems in the piece when I received it it hangs too much and start automatically very often
 When I requested a replacement..Flipkart refused to do so and said the product is fine and they canst replaced
 I am very disappointed with the service of Flipkart.
 Seems like now they have monopoly and they are playing games like other commerce retainers I will write in Logs and Forms as well
 I never expected such Worst service from Flipkart.
 R.I.P. Flipkart

 this phone is very good with its lollipop features have been using this phone and there is no issues with intothe
 only flaw is battery is draining quickly when we play games .
 2070mah battery is not enough for at 5 inch screen
 otherwise the phone is good to use

 After 18 days using review from my side
 Shone is just awesome an processing also good
 You can download many pp games in it
 and one think i like that all apes or game directly install in internal memory there is no more load on RAM.. Camera is little good... than others so i suggest you go through this products

 The moto G looks are very good and performance was excellent
 The outer edges are slippery and wife dropped it today and broke the gorilla glass which has cracked os replacement is expensive at os 5500.
 hence overall not all that satisfied

{
Umesh Mishra
 Very nice service from flipkart, but the phone has very poor battery
 The battery drains too too fast
 I had done replacement and still the new phone too had the same issue
 The phone at times goes directly from 80-85% to direct 15-20% and once you re-start and put on charging , it will come back to its original 80-85%.
 Part from battery good products
 But with such battery canst survive
 Suggestion : wont buy this phone

 I got the Back one a year back for my Father and am so happy with the product that i got a White one recently for my Other
 Build quality : is superb
 It feels premium but its heavy
 User Experience one of the reasons i got this is co of stock andros and regular updated
 Camera:average There are much better option available
 I wanted it for my parents who agent heavy users and wouldn even use 30% of phone capacity
 For them build quality and looks mattered more and in that department its hard to beat
 Android lollipop update has rendered it slow
 Hope this helps

 West thing is the Sure Android Platform which keeps you updated with the Latest Android version
 Only thing is the cost as today market is providing the same kind of cell phone in lower price of some good smart phone manufacturers

 I have been using this product for the past months THE PHONE os WELL BUILT, BUDGET PHONE os THE MARKET PROS: really the pro are very well highlight in the Flipkart very decently nd in a well-prescribed manner... so dont get confused it here CONS: I DIDN'T COME ACROSS ANY TECHNICAL PROB WITH THE PHONE - still some of the sons I felt are - the phone is bulky is not sleek
 which makes it unhappy to use only once hanged on rough usage if u want a budget phone with all features built go for it if u want some mobile phone which look cool and trend and ready to spend a bit more money u can very well go for HTC series MOTO-G (GEN-2):WORTH,VALUE FOR MONEY,BUILT os QUALITY

 I already replaced the product one time and the replacement product is also defective one
 There is a charging and networking issue in the cells
 Also there is a went on the upper speaker side

 Quite disappointment by flipkart and its service

Naveen Kumar G...
 I bought a Moto G and Generation mobile on with March during apes day I received a mobile as per the commitment however when I started using , I have realized that battery back is worst even though I did not made any calls
 I have complained to lip part with a great difficulty flipkart expert asked me to install the smart check software they says there is no issue
 I have raised a concern again I consulted Motorola service center on top of battery issue signal strength is very weak when I am at home absolutely zero signal until unless I go outside my house I dont get the signal I used the same him earlier in blackberry it works perfectly no signal issues at all
 I went to service center there also I had the signal issue I practically showed to service executive
 I have asked flipkart guns to replaced handset, they says they will look into the issue revert by with April
 In fact service executive spoken flipkart guy 30 days replacement policy is absolutely cheating people I met few more guns who are facing similar issues with moto go
 I went B2X is Motorola service center which is located at human pally,Hyderabad.
 I sincerely advice people not to buy products from flipkart at all
 He have to pay money and struggle ourselves
 He has installed OS, still the problem persist then he says that he will service my mobile why should we buy from flipkart and run after service centers
 I am really getting a doubt is flipkart selling the new ones
 I have lost faith in flipkart after having this incident careful with these guns

 I am having very bad experience this time :-(

 I had ordered this phone a month back
 After 3-4 days the phone started hanging every 5-6 hour and had to be restarted
 I complained to flipkart they said to rest the phone
 I did the process multiple times and Everytime had to back my data which is again a pain
 Later they said that the issue has been resolved and there will be no replacement
 Very poor service from flipkart.
 I prefer not to use flipkart again because of there poor service

 I have ordered the Moto G on Saturday and received it on Sunday.Delivery was fine
 There are 2 Major Issues in the Mobile
 1.
 After 4 Days normal Usage Yesterday i have Charged the Shone for 6 hours and within afternoon 3 Clock full Charge has drained
 Now i have put Charge for 2 hours still the Charge is os i am not saying the phone is totally bad some of the Shone has problems
 I have called the Customer Are 2 Times within the Schedule time only they will is the response Worst from Flip-kart Technical Support Beams 2. The Ringtone is the Second Issue already i had the Problem with ringtone but i rest the Shone the Problem was solved now again the same Problem To sound is Coming

Shuaib Saifi
 Motorola has also proved its also one of branded companies
 its has a poor quality camera
 A good camera is the one which can click clear pictures in low light that this phone cannot do that at all
 That is the benefit to spend 11,000 for a smart phone if it does not have a good camera instead one can buy a phone for around 5,000 with all most the same features
 its only Samsung that never disappoints its customer from the point of a good camera
 I use Galaxy Note 2 that a great camera and I will never think of any other brand but Samsung.

 After spending months of time in reading phone specification watching undoing couture video finally I realized Moto Os is still best in budget phone and ordered it from FLipkart.
 Flipkart delivered phone in 2 days only
 Thanks
 its a nice phone good built quality To heating problems after reading some reviews I was worried about it very sensible touch screen
 I played few big graphics game no problems so far
 And best thing was I got Lolipop O.S by default in my Shone
 Sometime very rarely it hangs i think this problem is with every andros device
 I am much satisfied with my choice it gives you an experience like your working on Nexus os device

 I ordered the phone on with and it got delivered on with of march
 I have been using phone all along and this was my first andros phone
 The phone is brilliant with great build quality
 Feels solid
 The screen resolution gives a feel of a premium phone
 Battery life is great
 Lasts one full day on Os with browsing social networking apes and calls
 The only negative aspect is that the phone gets very slow while using various apply
 To not a great phone for multi taking
 It hangs at times and him sure the updated to come in the Android Lollipop will rectify this negative aspect
 Considering the price point it is by far the best phone in the market and its a blind eyes yes for me if you were to compare other phone in the same price range

 a decent brand with a decent products
 reviews were awesome for this products
 every body was saying that it worth for its cost
 ended up buying this
 prone thwow display brightness was so good and clear
 2.lollipop updated
 3.curvey back case for handy
 memory for apes now i download near to 50 apes and it can be transferred to memory card as-well.
 5.charger when you touch the end of charger for connecting the phone you will find in a curved surface indicating the bigger and smaller ending need for inspecting the end before application if you use to it cost battery is not as expected as i was using lot of apply
 camera is not rousing small letters (tryto take a photo of words in a book and you will know what ism saying 3.headphone-yuk happy .
 data cable no data cable and a slow charger(my micromax charger is better than this changing issue 1.2 The Qualcomm Had More Processor & 1 os RAM(you will get irritated for sure because of this i had war with flipkart for getting refund for this products
 conclusion if convinced and ready to buy even after reading this review then follow the warning note below WARNING:be sure of not returning the product co i almost had a war with flipkart & the customer care person is amazingly replying me saying pus go for court do want you can do and asking me questions like if you dint read the review its not my mistaken
 him not blaming flipkart I faced such response ONLY for MOTO 2GEN previous mobile like mi note i dont have this problems
 take your call for this product you might be lucky up

 I got defeated products
 There is a dot and horizontal line on the screen which is clearly visible if i tilt the phone a bit
 National top most online seller has left me with such a worst experience in resolving my problem which is still pending as of the date i am writing review
 Customer executive always says with in 24 his our technical team will get back to you but these guns watches will turn to that 24 his and they wont get back to you again if you call the same words will be repeated
 Still waiting for their response its almost 20 days passed that the product has been delivered to me only 10 days left towards their so called return policy
 I am sure if you got such defeated product its like hell to you guns in getting resolved by flipkart.

 I received moto g 2014 in with of april Bottom speaker is completely not working,some signal drops also theresa made the return request at th of april,they called at with of april and said they will call by tomorrow pm to resolve my problem os I said how can I trust your service because because you said you will call me th of april,but actually called at with of april,so if you said you will call 16 th april you will call me after the 30 day period of returns,so I am unable to return after 30 days I know Flipkart are making fool of us by reducing 2000 os by advertising big pp sale by giving refurbished phones,I read in some of the forms they say flipkart are providing refurbished mobile
 To my 10999rs are gone in a second To I said the customer representative to cancel the return request(because its no use anymore,they wont call after 30 days),he said to wait a minute to decline the request,but actually he didn decline the request.So its clear that they are making us wait for 30 days,after that they are saying its not there responsibility
 He aware guns as my experience and also viewed other reviews too am not the only one experiencing these kind of issues,there are lot of them
 To finally my 5 digit money is not worthy for this mobile
 His is the last product I would buy in flipkart,and I wont recommend to buy anything from flipkart to my friends,and they wont buy because they already know what I am suffering now
 There is minimum of one star recommended for this reviews only I am giving it By opinion is its not worthy guns

 In Purchased Moto G and gen 16gb white phone during pp flash sale offer from day I noticed some jarring/hissing noise and irving sounds in ear piece while on voice calls
 it was very annoying to be on calls with that disturbing noise
 Also calls not reachable, call banks for few seconds during conversation Raised a return request got phone checked online by a flipkart technical and declared defective got approval for replacement
 By replacement phone reached me within 2 days of approval and it was hand to hand replacement thanks to flipkart :)).
 Unfortunately this phone is also of same issue along with speaker making much more noise while put for charging
 Cried with different telecom provider him same issue Changed SIM slot from 1 to 2 and verified : same issue
 Being a electronics product development engineer with 12 years experience I can assess this is a design defects not going to solve with getting handiest replaced
 *******Hope Motorola notice this and look into the issue in next phases.**********
 Part from this issue Moto-g and gen is a awesome phone with good feel on touchscreen, built etc... Regards Vishwanath

 I raised return request to replace the phone through webster as well as customer care But the response from them is very poor
 They will call you just to tell that your voice is not audible and we will schedule a call tomorrow like that Going forward dont buy any electrical goods from flipkart However my friend purchased in store and it is working fine without problems

 Device is good on the part of performance but battery drains out very quickly.The reality of motorola is that they have very bad service centres(specially if you are in bhubaneswar).
 I have got a very small memory card slot issue with my device
 I gave my product on 27-March-2015 and its been almost 3 weeks and i haven got my device back.Smart services authorized service centre of motorola) in bhubaneswar is a place where you must not visit with your device
 To not buy i motorola device
 It is highly recommended not to buy this device

 this product is a really genuine features phone the only problem is its battery life
 I did had camera issues on the first delivery and it showed an error camera busy and i would like to advise u to boot it in safe mode and see if it works or else immediately get it replaced
 the replacement model was too good but for a use from about a week or so i am realizing that with only light gaming and streaming the battery drains down to 15%!!!! this gets me into a lot of trouble only advisable for normal usage and not for professional use or gazing

 The phone works fine
 It hangs some times
 Sometimes when I try to call the phone just doesn call
 It wont hang but wont call either
 To matter how many times I try.It might get fixed with update of 5.1 Part from this the phone works perfectly fine
 him using both the him shots of the phone and the battery back is also good
 It lasts me almost a day with complete day usage if Os and WiFi.
 The display quality is also good and its easily visible in sunlight as well

 its just 2 to 3 months old and my mobile battery is not even giving the back up of 6. if ism using my phone for just couple of calls and whatsapp's legs it dies within 6 to 7 hours
 it is little slow as well compare to how fast it was new and it becomes very hot when ism using it or charging it
 sometimes i feel it can burn my skin i was very happy happy buying this phone but i had to change my thinking just after a months
 i should have paid less and got different phone
 this way ism thinking how long will be using this phone i will be forced to change my phone within 6 months i guessed

 For future customers of Motorola honest In input for people desirous of buying Motorola...certainly a nice phone...worries are in after sales support Either Motorola is over helped with large number of failure in their product or they care a damn once sale has been made and they have made their money
 To unless you are willing to undergo hardship of a period of two weeks and more just identify defect and another few weeks before sounds forever to get your phone up and running go ahead and burn the hole
 Would like to add specifically...delivery, etc handled by Flipkart was perrrrfect...only post sales customer care by Motorola is a big hole

 Flipkart people are selling defective cell phone they are not properly responding even though telling the problems of cell phone
 I bought Moto g agent
 phone which is often getting switched off while talking
 which is very bad and irritative
 After complaining also they are not interested to solve the problems by sending the person
 Must , they are saying suggestions and leaving complaints as it is
 THINK, BEFORE BUYING PRODUCTS os FLIPKART.

 I bought this mobile almost months back....Its really awesome.,I was stuck between Redmi,HTC,SOny...After tons of reviews and searches I Those this mob & its really up to expectation The only disappointment for me was the Headset a (NOrmal one,no os the ear headphones), The charger is not Detachable And the mobile takes solid his for full charge from 1-100%(not a big con-MANAGEABLE) I also like to share one of my experience,..Once I had only os of charge in the MOTO g 2,I charged it for 20mins Approx,as there was no time for further charging as i had to leave officer I switched off the mobile putting it in BATTERY SAVER mode and turned it on after his it had Amazingly 60% of battery life I have no IDEA wat happened and how my phone came up with a charge of 60%...!!!
 I strongly Recommend this MOB,..and last but not Least Flipkart.delivery

 The Moto Os doesn lag even with 10-12 applications in background , wondering why there is a new for 2 os RAM if one is an average user..Even big games such as Shalt 8 and FIFA15 run smoothly without a single last
 Love the Gorilla Glass display..it feels like sliding your fingers through Utter
 Recent attraction being the revolutionary Lollipop update .
 Now the downsides of the phone such as The Him Hard Detection which many of my friends too faced the issue Occasional All Drops while making it becomes total mute..I canst hear the opposite persons voice nor can he ..This has happened to me while in urgent situations..so its of great concern..Being visited the service centre twice and waiting for nearly 15 days to get it back is really frustration and annoying..also there are hardly 3-4 service centres
 Of it doesn face frequent issues then that good and worth
 His is only my personal experience after usage and not generalizing it as a bad phone saying these issues faced by all

 Complaining phone would be the worst thing anyone could come up with
 But charger provided
 OMG! shit man 3 hours to level from 10% to 98% His is frustrating.
 Would it not be GOOD to pack a good current rating charger in the package instead of this CRAP!
 Please os RETAIL, if not in the package least make other replacement that charges fast available to the accessories section of motorola products so that people like me can purchase one but not this one
 He dont grave for handsfree you are providing in the package
 Os better eliminate it and place a fast chasers
 Please make this happen as other charges available in the market could damage the phone
 And we dont want our 13,000 to go like flush

 I had bought a Moto Os and Men by flipkart on must March 2015.
 I had received the item very quickly idea on word itself
 from the day i started using the mobile lots of echo in the mobile and even who are speaking with me feeling the same
 Further it is becoming like a hot plate for speaking after 2 minutes
 I had requested flipkart for return of the mobile
 flipkart people passed 6 days time and then suddenly this morning they asked me to enter a code in some application smartchek and they have terrified everything is perfect
 But the thing is mobile getting too hot
 they advised me to moto g service even
 after visiting moto g service at had nothing has changed
 still even merely speaking after 2 minutes mobile is getting to hot
 I earlier bought two novo mobile from flipkart.
 But since they are perfect i did not complaint
 But when I have a complaint lip part not interested to bother about it since their business has increased
 Please do not buy any thing from flipkart

 Rose Well everyone knows about it.its
 MOTOROLA and the performance,display,camera,build quality,call quality all is very good.Handles heavy games and apes fine It was mitka but later updated to lollipop 5.0.2.
 Sons The only real con i felt is its battery.It should have been a better one.After lollipop the battery seems to perform better.on
 minimal use the phone last 24hrs.but
 with lots of browsing,gaming,phone call it wont go for more than 12hr.Once i played real racing on kitkat) for 5:30hr straight before phone battery goes from 98%-5%).but ism sure no one wants to play like that
 After lollipop the performance considerably reduced.more
 pp loading time,unexpected pp closure etc.but that the known problem with lollipop.it
 will be solved when lollipop 5.1 launched probably by end of april or may beginning I highly recommend this phone.Its worth the price.Dont just compare the specification to find the better phone that will disguise you

 9899/- is definitely a killer price and everybody should go for this instead of flooded chinese phone in the market
 UPDATE: Noticed battery problem that is very intermittent
 Even battery is around 80%, suddenly it goes to 1%.
 Though after restarting, it again shows 80%.
 And this behavior is very rare
 2-3 times in a months
 I complained to Flipkart.
 First they give their shit application to install and asked me to wait for the call
 I didn get any call for 2-3 days
 When finally after so many followups, I got call and these idiot tried to check battery with their shit pp
 To you think that their pp is so smart to catch this intermittent features
 To the pp passed the battery
 After fighting with that idiot he told me to rest the phone and wait for the call on next day
 I dont know how RESET can affect battery but still I wasted 2-3 hours in back-up my data
 And still I am getting call
 Moral os guy has become very smart now
 Even they provide replacement warranty of 30 days but they dont have intentions for that
 To wont recommended os anymore
