 Awesome phone
 Exceeded my expectations of a low budget phone
 Great speakers great build quality
 Awesome stock android.
 Only thing I will recommend for new buyers Os do NOT update to 5.0 lollipop because of lollipops memory bug
 still make the phone lag very easily due to only having go of ram
 Wait until 5.1 is released or Foot the phone

 Definitely a GREAT phone for the prices even if it could be more expensive it would worth it
 It have a great front facing camera (2mp), nice seizing smooth software looking forward to Lollipop!!) an amazing screen resolution vivid colors and a clear software without all those trash of apes pre loaded
 Will update the in use it for a few days!Update: works good on lollipop, just ran a little faster off battery and some features are removed like face unlocking
 But also includes a great data counter and a useful torch it could maybe run a little faster and it have some bursa but with the update of lollipop, i think most of them would be solved can watch moves and series easily the sound is GREAT, i love the fact that the speakers are in the front so you can hear everything the resolution of the screen is great please dont compare it to a retina display is not obvious the same)The size is perfect for medial the camera is really good have installed at least 72 apply and when it gets lagged i adjust the animation on developer mode and all solved love this phone offers a lot for a good price.You should get a good cases and forget a little in the aestethics, because of the cuts in the material investments that Motorola does on this honest you can really regret if you just use it with no cases
 i use it with a TPU case and goes good with it no screen protector yet and so far Gorilla Glass 3 is doing its job amazingly...
 To scratch before 1 month of use without lip case os

 I read all the reviews about how the camera isn good enough or the phone doesn have LTE.
 The phone is great
 I get 5 to 10 Lips down and 1-2 Lips up on T-Mobile.
 Plays Netflix and Candor very well.Update 1:This is a broader issue with many honest The screen is polarized so in landscape mode the screen is black if you are wearing polarized sun glasses.In the car I have Bluetooth, Screen on max brightness and GPS running I use a good amount of the battery up quickly
 War Charger is definitely useful.Awesome phone
 I like it way better then the Nexus 4. Seems like a lot more stuff just works
 In the Nexus 4 I had poor sound quality and Bluetooth never worked well especially in my Sonya Civic
 The Moto G works very well with my Honda.Update 2:Over Blue tooth and with ear buds plugged in I do not have have the volume up very high

 I bought this cell phone in february and last week the screen went black and the de motorola log appeared
 Nothing else but that
 I tried to recovery the system buy the only phrase was Volume down new pressed and then boot failed
 I am really disappointed with this purchase and of course i dont have any warranty because i lived outside US.Today, the technical service told me that the motherboard is broken
 Now can it be the telephone has only 3 months

 His is a great phone!!!Though it is a cheap phone by no means does it feel or look cheap.Android software is fantastic and so it the processor of the phone.Rear camera it pretty good front camera is normal.Battery life is outstanding!The box does not bring much but all cable are compatible with those of Samsung.I would definitely recommend this phone to any one looking to buy a new phone without spending too much $$$

 I bought this one 2 month ago.the

{
Medco
 Had the Fire Shone which I thought was fine until I realized its limitations
 To Bluetooth 4.0, anaemic OS very slow
 To I bought the Moto G and generation
 Was andros 5 and Bluetooth LE.
 Such more responsive and allows me to son with fitness wearables.
 Vice screen and pretty good auditor
 Was dual sterno speakers
 By only negative response is Motorola's awful teach support
 Otherwise a great phone for the money

sirfelix
 Been using my new phone for a couple weeks and love it
 To unlocking no bloatware and I really like the front facing speakers
 I took away one star because I find the battery doesn last all day if the os screen is on a lot
 Battery setting shows the screen is taking up most of the battery even when I keep the screen brightness turned down all the way
 Other than that him happy with it

 After I have had the Motorola Moto G 16GB dual him for about 6 months I immediately wanted to try this version of 2014 with the 5 " screen and I have to say that I did not regret this upgrade.The good points are definitely the excellent screen that is really sharp and bright
 The battery lasts quietly a couple of days
 Although the memory is only 8 os you are able to save the majority of apply music and photos on the os card that allows you to have about 3-4 go of free space
 The breakthrough was undoubtedly the camera that has grown from 5 to 8 myxo
 It seems nothing here but these 3 pp more really makes the difference
 The pictures in bright light are fantastic and those with less light has much less noise that the one from Moto G 2013.
 I have not found problems in probability being Moto G 2014 slightly thinner and the weight and absolutely the same as the first Moto Os Ought on Amazon Pain for 161 europe 168 including shipping a really good deal
 A fantastic mobile that I really recommend to everyone

 Check out my Couture channel AppsOnFire for a video review!So my phone has recently broke and I didn have that much too spend so I was looking for a phone that can still perform well and not break the budget and I decided to pick up the Moto G because I have heard really great things about it
 It is a great mid range phone at the price of a low end one
 It has some pretty good speck and you are also getting Android Lollipop all for the price of $180 Unlocked
 To here is my full review of the Moto G and GenerationDesignSo the design of the phone is actually not that bad
 It certainly doesn look like your paying only 180 dollars it actually has pretty nice build quality and feels really nice in that hand
 It may be hard to notice but the phone has a very subtle curve do it which makes it more comfortable to hold
 Its not the thinness phone out there but looks fairly slim and sleek
 It also is not that heavy it is pretty much entirely made of plastic and the back is removable which gives you access to the him card slot and micro sd slot for expandable storage which is a big plus
 You get a 5 inch 720p display and you also get some front facing speakers which is not too bad
 You got all your buttons on the side which I found to be pretty bushy when first pressing them but got them used to them not too long after
 Overall the design of the Moto G is nothing to write home about but is amazing for the price and I am pretty satisfied with how the phone looks and feels.CameraSo usually on smartphones this cheap you get a camera that is pretty bad but that is definitely not the case with the Moto Os
 You actually get a pretty decent camera
 But dont expect this to be a flagship camera
 The phone focused a little bit slow and it doesn take photos very fast either
 The Camera on the moto g also suffers in lowliest situations but if you have the right lighting this camera is actually pretty good
 The is the same for the front camera as well
 It actually takes some pretty good series in good conditions
 Were are some samples.PerformanceSo how does this phone perform at such a low prices
 Any people think at this price point that a phone canst perform well but that is not the case here with the Moto Os
 It is still packing a 1.2 the Had core processor with a gig of Am which is still some decent speck in today standards
 Everything usually runs smoothly with the Moto G because it is running pretty much stock andros with no bloatware or skin to slow it down
 But multitasking seems to slow this phone down and will start to lag if you have a bunch of apes open
 But the lag is not so bad that the phone becomes unusable.
 Overall this phone can handle your daily tasks as long as you dont go crazy and the battery life will last almost a full day of you are not a crazy power user.Final thoughts that is pretty much the end of my review and the Moto G is a great budget phone for people who need a back or who are just trying to save some money but still want a great phone

Martin Sisk
 I recently made the switch from in to Android, mostly because I am definitely on a budget and my old th Men shone just want cutting it for me anymore
 Without a budget-conscious option from Apple I turned to the world of Android and immediately got a ton of recommendations for the Moto Os Having hands-on experience with some other lowered Android phone like the os Optimus, I was initially nervous I was signing on for a slowed-down experience and a phone bloated with tons of proprietary software but what I got instead was a speedy fun-to-use, and quite simply slightly mindblowing experience for someone who never had a smartphone that want at least a year old by the time it got into my hands.The phone is pretty much the perfect size fitting in every pocket comfortably but still feeling large and impressive when playing video
 Os someone going from a 480p 3.5-inch display to a 720p inch display this felt like coming out of the dark ages
 One of the common things I saw when looking at whether to grab a st gen or and gen Moto G was the drop in pp but I honestly feel like the images are as crisp as you want them to be and quite honestly with the resolution of the phone the top bar and clock feel a little on the small side for me so a smaller display with the same resolution would actually be rather annoying.Technologically this phone was a massive upgrade for me
 Pp loaded in a snap and once I opened an pp there was almost no lag between making a selection and getting a result
 The software included with the phone was minimal which is fantastic as someone who rates bloatware and wants to have as much control over their experience as possible
 Motorola had only a few proprietary apes installed by default all of which were opt-in.
 To far I haven speed in to Motorola Assist or Alert and the only other Moto pp that came installed was Migrate which I used to move my contact and calendars from my shone to my Moto G without mentally copying the numbers
 Since that the only thing it can really be used for when twitching from in to Android, I canst give a full review of some of its other features but it worked well for what I used it for
 The rest of the pre-installed apes were all default Android and Google apply which I wont review in much detail since most peoples mileage will definitely vary on those feel less-than-qualified to give a detailed breakdown on things like the camera quality and processor speed but as someone who knows what RAM is I can say that this phone makes a compromise in that area 1 os is a comfortable amount for any one thing you want to do and the phone is pretty intelligent about shutting down apes if the current pp is more memory-hungry than others
 In the other hand if your a power user who would be looking to take advantage of multitasking, or if you want to play some of the more intense mobile games you want to look at spending more money
 With the expandable os storage for things like music moves pictures or other files 8 os feels like a comfortable amount of on-board storage
 His would be the main reason to choose a Moto G over a Moto Os since the OS uses almost 2.5 os all by itself leaving little room for apes that either canst or shouldn be stored on an os cards
 I have a 32 os micro os card in my phone and I still use 5 os of my board storage just on apes and download Notify playlists.One other limitation of this phone that I personally do not care about is the lack of Os data
 There is no Os radio in the phone so the highest speed you'll be able to get on this phone is 3G.
 Personally I dont even have a data plan since I live on a college camps where wife is both reliable and ubiquitous.
 For some people thought this would be a deal-breaker.
 There is a Os version of the st generation Moto Os and if this is the one reason you dont want this phone and highly encourage checking that outdoor the prices him almost certain this is the best phone your going to find new out of the box
 Really unless your a power user and you dont want to be conscious of how much memory your apes use while doing in the background this is definitely a phone worth considering for any budget if your looking to save money
 The one concern I do have is longevity, since as flagship phone bolster their processors and RAM developer might look to use more of that power leaving users of underpowered phone using outdated apply
 His is what happened to me with my th Generation iPhone.
 Os it stands thought this is the best buy in the smartphone world right now and a must-buy for anyone on a small budget not looking to lease or finance

 Now incredible device in the midrange pricking range.This turned out to be much better than I had anticipated
 I spend a lot of time in Europe and I used to plug my os T-Mobile SIM card in my shone Os when Stateside, and put its EU-sibling in my Foka N9.
 When going overseas the SIMs would swap honest
 That way my shone would always be my primary device to avoid racking up roaming charges clipping the national debt of certain countries yet I would remain connected on both numbers.But although the Os was great for a while when Foka chose to steer itself off a cliff by going Windows phone something else had to come instead
 Yes I did buy a Gumma 800, but I found it infuriating to use
 I really tried to like it but I couldn't.
 It looked like the N9, but that is where the analogies ended short from both being good at holding down paper
 The Os had to come out of the drawer again but its total lack of apes made it no better than a feature phone albeit with one tenth of the battery life.So, not having used a Motorola since the Dynatac, this was quite a surprise
 It is really fast the screen is gorgeous - sharp with rich colors the device is thin enough the camera is quite oka battery life is quite good it is light enough and the phone is not too ugly
 It is not an shone os which I did consider but at one fourth the price I think it is certainly a lot better than you would expect
 its a black plastic slab but not worse than any Samsung out there.The camera low light performance is a bit better than the shone os but the imagine algorithms are a little worse in bright light
 Board memory is only a few figs but I stuck in a 32GB micro os card I still had laying around and memory is no longer in short supply.It does not support LTE, but I tested download speed north of 10Mbps and unload a little less than half that on a Finnish network
 I assume it does not do HSPA-DC, which can give you here about 25Mbps down but 10Mbps covers all my needs.It came out of the box with Android 4.4, but it apparently is Android 5 capable.It is good enough for me to start considering if I should classify my shone to secondary device and make this the primary one

 Battery life is certainly an issue for me on this phone
 Of I use it a bit then I need to plan on charging Sitting around my work desk with just testing or a few quick calls and it will last all day
 Still on Android 5.0.2, though I keep hearing I will see M on it
 Works fine no lockup pretty solid phone though and and buy another one again

 its definitely a budget smartphone, but externally it doesn look like it
 its not as sappy as higher end phone and it is short on storage
 However it looks like it is worth more than it is and is very functional for standard smartphone use email web browsing Facebook etc.).
 For the price it is well worth it to use on a cheaper service

 His phone is fairly intuition and easy to use however I started having memory issues after a couple months of owning it
 I figured out how to increase the memory and disabled some of the extraneous apply but I have to check the memory every couple of weeks to make sure it doesn start freezing up on me
 I would not suggest buying this phone

 After having my Nexus 5 stolen I decided to buy this as a replacement until the 2015 version of the Nexus 5 is release
 him very impressed by the screen and quality feel
 I slightly disappointed that there was no tireless charging but hey its less than $200.
 Of the nexus line is too expensive for your budget definitely buy this phone

 Using this right now
 its great
 I got a "Locked" one for some reason
 I proceeded to clock the bootloader myself
 When it took me half a day to figure out how to get Lollipop 5.0.2 on there
 That failed SIM card didn read (T-mobile).
 To I reverted back to 4.4.4 and then flashed it to Lollipop 5.0.1 and it worked
 its rewarding

 It took about ten days to deliver to my house
 Must wonder why took so long

 But so far I like the phone a lot
 I used to have Phone 4 which worked very well till I dropped in the water
 After that it kept acting crazy
 It is my first time to use andros system new and excited so far.Update: I really dont know what is wrong with the phone
 I put 32G card inside and move all the apes which I can move to the os cards
 Now is getting worse
 It took pick so slow
 And it had so many time of black screens on me when I tried to use the apply

 It first it looks like a very nice phone but the sterno speakers still plays so loudly even when you have plugged in your earphones.

 It is an awesome and functional phone
 I only have a complaint I bought it for $279 early February and now is $100 cheaper
 I did it because it was not in Stock for like two months and when it became available it was more expensive...I decided not to wait anymore and now I regret it I could have save myself $100.
 Whatever.--------------------------------UPDATED
 os 08/25/2015I've been using this phone for 6 months now and I have several complaints
 him not a teach expert but this phone is too slow some pass suddenly just stop working when ism using them and one particular fact the phone usually gets overheard if you use it for a long time for example if you watch video on Snapchat)I was happy with my phone but now its a pain in the ass
 And its a shame because I bought it for $100 more than the original prices

 I dont know if it is an Android problem or a Moto problems
 I have a 32GB extreme micro sd where I migrated all of my data and most of the apes to
 I also cleared the ache after upbraiding to Lollipop, this seems to had made it a bit faster ( or less slow I should say ) but it is still cap
 I used shone for several years and then got a Gumma 920, I would pick Microsoft again over these two anytime.
 I need a device that is responsive when I need it as I cannot afford missing calls and not being able to answer messages quickly because the damn phone is stuck in an infinite loop doing who knows what
 I will probably give it away to one of my nephews so they can play with it and get another Lumia.UPDATE: I decided to give it 2 stars instead of 1 after discussing with friends about OS for smartphones.
 He all agreed Windows Shone is the most reliable and better designed of the three big players although the least popular and "cool").
 A friend pointed out he had used three different phone running Android, including a Galaxy and its cap compared to his $70 Gumma 635.
 To its unfair to put all the blame on Motorola's engineers the Moto G might be a good piece of hardware looks like it is running a happy OS.
 But ultimately this review intends to warn and advise other consumers
 I am not pro Microsoft, but in my experience they own the best OS for mobile right now perhaps because they have control over both hardware and software development
 Nexus vs Gumma would be a more fair comparison perhaps
 Anyway I would not recommend this phone to anyone for half the price you can get a device that is truly fast and reliable and wont get sluggish and need cold starts every now and then

 The main reasons I chose the Moto g were (1) price (2) speck for a budget phone and (3) prospect of receiving an andros updated
 For less than $200 this phone definitely has great value
 I will not be mentioning the speck in this review but definitely check out other reviews ardor teach review websites.Some sons so far (techie buyers beware):-screen shatters after a fall this would be expected of any phone that falls unto a cement driveway BUT what I did not expect is shares of glass splinters
 Luckily I had the plastic screen protector that originally came on the phone to stop the splinters from injuring my fingers
 The underlying LCD screen remained intact however the outer glass is the main culprit
 It first I wanted to do the repair on my own by purchasing the outer glass on Amazon but beware it is close to impossible to only replace the outer glass without a full digitizer replacement as well
 Some local repair shops wanted to charge upwards of $200 to fix the entire screen assembly which is crazy since the phone costs less have since contracted Motorola support to fix my device really great customer service and they charge $75 physical damaged to replace the device.-NO
 OTA Android upgrade if on smaller carriers I switched from a major carrier to smaller Cricket Tireless after purchasing my moto G and genu
 I have seen tons of announcements online that Motorola was doing a OTA release to Android 5.0 but I still didn receive my update notification.
 I even download the Motorola device manager from their webster but it kept on telling me that no update was available
 When I finally contracted Motorola support about the cracked screen mentioned above they politely informed me that OTA updated are still linked to my carrier which does NOT even carry the device
 I am really disappointed that even though I purchased an unlocked os device from amazon I am not eligible to get a software update because of my choice in carriers
 Its like being linked to a contract all over again
 I guess if I want a software update I have to go with a Google play experience phone instead of a Motorola with their false promise of a software upgrade.Apart from those issues the phone works well and Motorola has a good customer support line to provide answer no matter how infuriating they may be

 By phone seemed to start acting up about two months in - always froze when using apes overall
 I had to do factory rest and not download apes such as facebook so it would be somewhat faster but not satisfied with having to do this considering only 60% of my memory on my phone is used

 His mobile looks to be good in terms of battery
 I am not much user of application except for messages and whatsapp.

 Excellent Cellphone, I updated to Android Os Works Perfectly with my Movistar SIM, Good size faster than my os L7, Really elegant

 I thought this was a very nice phone but it has one major flaw have had my motor xt1064 for a few months but just recently had to buy a new one cause I put my phone on charge by going to bed and when I woke up it was really hot with ratification light stuck on wouldn turn on anymore I took the case off and the phone was wet but want water I went to best buy and got a new motor same model I still like this phone but it tends to run hot and worse is u canst remove the battery also New updated phone from best buy is running Kitkat4.4.4 now very stable came with 5.02 Lollipop but I dont like it so I installed factory ROM I had done exact same thing on phone from amazon and all it could do is act buggy with ratification disappearing constantly and many apes crashing acting funny and phone always getting warm or hot Note in order to install any Os including factory u will need unlocked bootloader & recovery two or com SuperSU binary installed warning trying to do this to your phone will void warranty & could turn your phone into useless brick so read up on everything fully by trying anything

 I bought this phone to replace my ZTE Overture on Cricket Tireless
 His phone in short is incredible and hard to believe Motorola is selling it direct to the public unlocked for less then 200.00.
 His phone is a diamond in the rough and a win for any one that needs a good smartphone that can go head to head with phone that cost hundreds of dollars more on a contract from ATT, T-Mobile Horizon or Print
 Motorola has taken what people actually want in a smartphone, refined it to work well make it look cool have good speck and be simple to use on any GSM network for the prices was able to get this phone next day shipped for 8.99 with Amazon Crime
 That is fantastic since NONE of the major phone provides in the USA carry this phone as of 11/2/14.Pros:Stock Android KitKat that is upbraiding to Lollypop soon.Google Now integration right from the home button.Large os colourful screenSimple access to the him cardFast processor that does not lagStereo speakersCamera that gets better rating then the Moto X.Expandable Micro os card slot unlike its cousin from last year.The phone works with any US/International GSM phone service providers.No bloatwear comes with the phone.The build quality is fantastic.Cons: There are not many)Phone clips and cases are hard to find for the phone
 The phone is larger then most phone so this is a problem.The NiteiZE large is one of the only cases I could find that fits the phone.No LTE supportThe back cover needs to have some grip to it since the phone is large to hold on one hand.The battery canst be removed.No major os service provider carry the phone
 Os of 11/2/14 you can only buy it direct from Motorola or on Amazon.This is a fantastic phone for people who want an awesome Android phone but not break the bank
 Of you have Cricket Tireless Retro PCS or any GSM based phone provider consider this phone
 Speed and function wise this phone is on par with anything from the major phone manufactures
 His phone gives you all the speck and advantages of a phone that costs much more

 His phone was my first purchase from Amazon Warehouse Heals
 It was listed as like new condition and the price was 20% below the cost of a new phone
 The phone arrived in a sealed damaged retail box
 It appeared to be brand-new; nothing missing no signs of handling
 To I endorse buying this like new from Warehouse Heals if you have the opportunity
 You do sacrifice the devices year warranty by purchasing it "used," but unlocking the bootloader invalidates the warranty anyway.Migration from my old Android phone was pretty painless
 Google and the Motorola Migration software will transfer virtually everything from an old Android phone aside from apes that were not installed through Lay Stores
 There is 5.5GB of internal storage space available
 I installed a 32GB micro cards unlocked the bootloader, installed TWRP recovery and rooted the phone
 I plan to stick with the stock ROM for the foreseeable future and use Posed for mods.To conserve battery life both generations of the Moto G are very dim with the default auto brightness settings
 I dont like that so I used GravityBox in Posed to significantly increase the brightness
 Display accuracy seems to vary greatly from one phone to another but FWIW, these are measurement taken on my Moto G:Contrast ratio 1,555:1Average color temperature (20% - 100%): 6855KGamma: 2.69Grayscale average did 4.07Color Hecker average did 4.39Max brightness 376 cd/m2 (110 fL)The contrast is typical for an LCD smartphone display and the color accuracy is fair
 All primary and secondary colors have pretty accurate hue except for red and magenta.
 All are undersaturated, except for magenta.
 Although it measured high the mamma looks good in actual use
 The coolness of the color temperature and undersaturation of colors are noticeable but the display looks pretty good overall.The speakers are an improvement over other phone have had but I dont have any experience with the acclaimed HTC "BoomSound" honest
 Although the speakers sound pretty good by phone standards their volume is about average
 Using the Axis ringtone, I measured my and gen Moto Os a st gen Moto G and an HTC Sensation all face-up on a desk next to my sound peter
 Although the Sensation sounded the quietest to my ears from a greater distance than the sound meter), it measured about the same goodness as the and gen Moto Os
 The original Moto G was clearly the loudest measuring about 10 do higher than the other phone (~100 vs ~90).I'm not much of a photo so I dont have much to say about the camera
 Pictures are okay I guess
 It takes video in only 720p, and the video quality seems pretty lousy.I'm on the fence about the size of this phone
 I can appreciate having such a large screen but this phone is really pushing the limits of what I feel is an acceptable size for a phone
 I think I might have preferred if Motorola had used a 4.7" or 4.8" screen and kept the size of the phone closer to the original Moto Os
 The os Os mind for example has a 4.7" screen and is roughly the same size as the st gen Moto G.Pros+ Obviously the prices Sure AOSP combined with Posed and GravityBox is a wonderfully trouble-free mostly Android experience
 His is a delight after years of using buggy CM-based ROMs on other phones.+
 micro support Recent front-facing sterno speakers Pretty decent display quality with a color temperature that is (thankfully) under 7000K, but display quality surely varies os radio - rarely found in phone these days and although I admittedly dont use it very often I do like to have the optionCons- Low-end CPU, GPU and RAM, none of which are upgrade from the st gen Moto Os The sealed battery is more difficult and costly to replace than a "user-replaceable" battery
 I just replaced a battery in one of my other phone for $5. OEM Moto G batteries are selling for over $20, and some phone disassembly is required to replace them
 To 4G, NFC, MHL or IR, but I really dont care about any of that Door quality video captured Included charger has an integrated cable and is only 550mA

 I bought this phone on December rd and it was delivered way before time on December the
 Ve been using it ever since as my daily driver to replace my old unlocked HTC One X AT&T.This is a great value device
 Right out of the box you can feel the premium quality material that the phone is made up from
 His is stock andros 4.4.4
 OS and andros lollipop is a guaranteed updated
 (I'm in the Caribbean now and checking once in a while for the lollipop update but naval ) Today Ve already received gallery camera and other motorola specific software updates...The only major flaw him experiencing with it is that I found it to have a poor battery life
 Even if I use it in a moderate manner all still have to charge it twice a day
 Its seems that the screen is using all the power because the battery manager always shows the display to be using 48% or 50% even 73% of the charge
 His is the reason why in giving it 4 stars...Hope a software update will fix this.Update: Wednesday December 31, 2014Out of nowhere my phone doesn turn on.After spending a quiet day with it once back home tonight I put it to charge
 After a while I decided to check something in it while it was connected to a power source
 His is when I realize the battery icon indicates that the phone is plugged but was not charging
 I Checked the power cord the phone came with but it doesn seem to have any problem because I use it on another phone and it works fine
 I even tried another charger but nothing am so disappointed
 I have all my stuff in it pictures video contact etc that haven backed up yet
 Now I have no choice its now stars
 The phone didn even last a full month.Unfortunately I am returning it...

 The value that is found here is outstanding
 His phone is unlocked - it works on nearly ever GSM network in the entire world
 SIM chips are easily changeable, meaning you can buy plans and SIM chips at will and use this phone as you please
 To restrictions
 To contract
 To more financing your phone as if it were a car.Samsung phone are great but there $650.
 Apple phone are great but there $650+.
 Personally I prefer the Android operating system because I have more control and it is more customizable.
 In this Moto G you have essentially all the features of a $650 phone for a small price of $180.
 Except this one is unlocked
 One more cadet - since it only has 1GB of RAM it doesn handle multitasking between os apes like high-priced phone can
 But really are you that needy
 Os what your doing really THAT important
 Os the enslavement to a 2 year contract worth the difference in multitasking performance
 Os locking yourself into a contract AND a provider with your phone choice worth the difference
 For me it wasn't.
 I like to have a decent camera to capture memories funny video etc
 I like to have a phone that can make quality calls on provider network AND over wife with Android apply
 I like a phone that I can use to text people - easily and efficiently
 A phone that I can check my email on
 A phone I can add space to mind os cards
 His is that phone
 And luckily its only $180.
 him not stuck in any contract - I can do literally whatever I want
 Forget the thumbprint readers the smile detection the big megapixel number the multitasking of a desktop and the screen resolution of a 50" TV, get this save money and truly own and control what is yours

 The phone keeps freezing
 its very unreliable.
 Sometimes it wont unlocked apes freeze and starting doesn help
 have even taken the battery out but it starts up frozen
 Doesn't happen all the time but at least a few times a weeks
 Today my alarm was going off in a meeting and I couldn turn it off
 I had to power down the phone
 I restarted when I got out and then I couldn clock the screen
 I finally got it unlocked and then my goose maps wouldn let me choose my location and I had to wait several minutes before I could navigable my way home.Daling with their customer service is a nightmare
 Last weeks online chat support had me pressing and holding the power and volume buttons for 3 full minutes and then told me to press the power key which set it back to step one
 His was repeated with the same result
 Spent 20 minutes to accomplish nothing before calling their support number
 They remained me me instructions for troubleshooting.
 Burns out you only need to hold the keys for 3 SECONDS and then press the volume button
 Troubleshooting process fails at step 5..tried it at least 10 times
 After wasting another big chink of time with another service rep who had to put me on hold every time I asked a question I finally asked to speak to a supervisors which was useless since he only repeated the same scraped responses
 I told him about the discrepancy with the troubleshooting process and re said they have different logic processor
 I said they probe had type nobody had the sense to recognized
 He did not agree
 To now they want to charge me a premium fee to replace a defective products

 I received the phone well on time
 Line is a os GSM white model
 I was skeptically at first about the performance and overall experience but I am glad I was wrong.The phone is absolutely fantastic for its prices
 The performance as well the quality stand out.Firstly, the software
 The pure andros (almost).
 Motorola provides the stock andros with very very few but useful apes like Motorola Migrate).As a result the phone is able to handle everything you throw at it
 It almost perform on par with the likes of flagship honest
 That being said it will surely wont let you down
 The quand core processor does its job pretty well
 I never saw the phone lag at any point.Secondly, the storage
 It comes with a standard 8GB memory
 However you have a micro-SD slot to increase the limited memory.Thirdly, the battery life
 The phone lasts at least a day with normal usage
 For people who are continuously chatting and calling and playing games the battery will not last long enough
 Part from that it will serve you well.Overall, at such a price point its a killer
 You will not go wrong if you are thinking of buying it.P.S.: His is not a Os phone
 The max it supports is UMTS/HSPA+.
 But if you are not a heavy user you do not need Os then
 The speed will be good enough
 Line has a T-Mobile service and it runs smooth without issues.Buy
 os model if you are in USA, otherwise if you travel a lot internationally, then Global model will better suit you
}

 Ought the Global GSM version (black).
 It works smoothly on AT&T HSPA network
 I saw a lot of people asked T-Mo but few asked ATT...
 To I would like to point this out...I am satisfied with the downstream speed as for non-video-streaming usual use like Google Cap checking email browsing webster like Amazon using shopping and banking apply etc Upstream is a bit tight in my opinion
 I user dropbox to son photo and it takes much longer than my HTC One on AT&T LTE network was expected).I like the screen size
 Resolution is on the lower side compared with other new phone these days
 I can also notice some diagonal stripes on the screen when looking from certain angles when the screen is on - I am not saying those touch-sensing cell traces when the screen is off
 It doesn bother me but I am sure some people will get annoyed by these stripes.Battery life is good
 I still had 40% left after normal use browsing like Os & FB, testing using maps taking couple pictures here and there from am to pm yesterday
 I did not play games,although I watched roughly 30 minutes of video and made a couple 20+ minutes phone calls....
 It was on iii for most of the time
 Bluetooth was on all day also really like the non-slip back cover
 It doesn feel cheap in hand like many other plastic honest
 By biggest complaint on the HTC Os was that it wouldn stay in my hand...
 I like the metal feeling but I had to put on sleeve to keep it in my hand in dry winter days

 I previously had a Nexus 4 and I loved it but after almost two years it was finally starting to die so it was time for a changes
 After searching for a replacement I found the the Nexus 5 was no longer available and the Nexus 6 is too expensive for this college girl
 I was resistant to buy the Moto G and genu at first $180 for a no contract smartphone, what the catch
 However I am so happy I took the chance the Moto G can keep up with some of the best smartphones out there.Like most college students I spend lots and lots of time on my phone
 The Moto G was able to keep up with all the testing talking email twitter interest etc with little to no lag time.The screen looks great - I would say better than my nexus 4.
 Even on a very low brightness it looks awesome.Battery life is leaps and bounds better than the Nexus 4. I am able to go all day about am when I leave for work until pm when I get home from school without charging my phone while still using it all day
 Os do have the screen set to a low brightness and am not constantly on the phone the whole day but I would say I use my phone more than the average person love that the phone is completely unlocked
 To easy to switch carriers and find the best prices with out the crazy prices.Overall an amazing phone at an amazing prices
 Highly recommended

 Motorola failed the expensive smartphone market with this one.The features that the Moto G packs put it on par with phone double its prices
 I knew what to expect feature-wise, before I got it but was particularly impressed with the build quality
 I came from a Samsung Galaxy S3, which was a great phone but lacked a solid feeling with its plastic body
 The Moto G has a plastic body but feels great in the hand with the grippe exterior that doesn show fingerprints.
 It has survived several small drops unscathed, and I dont have a case on it Os dont recommend dropping it just saying that its durable).On top of the features and solid build quality - there are prompt Android updated
 Previously you could only expect this for Nexus phone and a handful of high-end honest
 Buds to Motorola for providing this level of support to the lower end of the smartphone market
 The Android experience on the Moto G in general is great - stock as far as I can tell.On the negative side there are only 8 os of board storage space - fortunately there is a micro sloth so the small board storage is less of an issue
 The phone also lacks 4G, but honestly have barely noticed it unless him downloading a large file while not in range of wife which is rarely
 In the positive side on the network it has wife hotspot enabled by default

 Global GSM vs os GSM topic in the US)I'm from Europe but live in the os for a few years
 To I bought the Global GSM version as it is written that it should work with GSM carriers
 I tried with both AT&T (PureTalk) and T-Mobile (BYO tireless and none of them worked
 Strangely my old him card from Europe was working roaming on AT&T network... but it wouldn work on the PureTalk simcard.
 I spent a lot of time with customer service of BYO and PureTalk and their final answer was that the phone was the source of the problems
 To their credit their him worked with phone of friends.So I sent it back and got the os version
 It works with both carriers
 Yay... but it wont work in Europe.Something very puzzling about the global GSM phone I got was the inscription on the bottom left of the back after removing the cases it was written CDMA.
 Strange for a GSM phone right
 In the os version its written AWS instead feel a bit frustrated not having the global GSM working here
 Does anyone think I might have gotten a CDMA version that was bound not to work but there was a SIM card sloth so its GOT to be GSM and not CDMA right?)? the any chance it was a one time mistake and I could try again getting a global GSM one or am I wasting my time
 Did anyone get a global GSM working with mobile or AT&T in California

 you can go wrong when you buy a motorola smartphone, battery last all day updated are fast and easy to installs and build quality is great for the prices this phone could be for someone buying a smartphone for the first time or may for a back phone

 Over all it is good
 Couple of sons that I see are
 Battery backup.
 Moto could have improved it
 It stays only for 24 his once charged.2.
 Speaker is little loud when answering the call
 People near us can also hear even at the lower volume

Marcos Rimoldi
 Great phone
 It should be at least 16gb but anyway i use it with a 32gb memory cards
 The camera is improved from st genu
 but battery seems to last less because of bigger screen
 Would support g too but still is more than what you can expect for $190.

 The Motorola Moto G and generation is a very good cell phone
 I was surprise how wonderful the phone is with the lower price compared to other honest
 I am not on my phone that much so I dont need all the crazy features other prices phone have

 When I received the Motorola Os I realized that the phone was bent so the back cover didn fit properly
 I have placed a replacement order two weeks ago but him still waiting for the replacement
 I hope this new Moto G is OK, without any defects

 Ought as a Christmas gift for my more
 The loved it
 Super easy to use especially for someone who doesn typically use newer teach
 Doesn't have all the bells and whistles but definitely more than adequate for the non-power user
 Great value

 I have been using the phone for around 5 months
 By only complaint is the battery life
 I cannot get through a day without plugging in to charge up am thinking of downloading to the Moto E in hopes of better battery life
 Lollipop Locks
}
{
Melanie
 Great phone for the prices
 Very sappy and smooth despite the specification
 It seems to be as fast and smoother than the Samsung Galaxy Os that I replaced
 Battery life is decent and lasts for an entire day with 3-4 hours of on screen time
}
{
Santiago Parquet
 I got it on sale great price also I already have andros lollipop so that cool However It came whit a problem with de speaker the sound sometimes comes out with distortion I dont live in Sa so can use the warranty other than that great

 His is a phone that I bought for my teenage son and it turned out to be better than my own Motorola, a bit bigger and all
 I may end up getting one too when my contract is up with Horizon and put it on Consumer Cellular
 Such cheaper plans
}
{
Robert
 its a good phone it would be better if the Bluetooth problem when updated to lollipop would work
 The Bluetooth fails shuts itself off after about 5 minutes and the Bluetooth stops working
 Ebook reload clear this n that Bluetooth fails
}
{
Eseosa Aigbogun
 Seriously why spend a fortune on a Samsung Galaxy
 His gives you the andros experience and way cheaper
 I really like the ratification light when you have a missed call SMS, email etc
 The build quality is great
 Comfortable to hold took
}

 the phone is beautiful and works fine but it loose the signal every time working with Telcel in Mexico
 Even at home where I always had signal on other honest this unit loose it
 If works excellent
 Everything works fine but the phone
}
{
Ahmed de Rossi
 To word of unhappiness with this phone incredible prices
 Seriously works smooth and can do a lot of things almost like a high end one which you would find in 600 us or more so taking that in consideration buying this phone is a win/win.

Frank M
 His is my wife phone
 its not as fast as my Nexus 5 or has the high definition screen
 But for the price and the casual user it is a good pick
 The speakers are loud
 It just updated to the Lollipop 5.0 so that was a help on the battery
}
{
Ivan747
 Excellent solid and unfordable phone
 The display is high quality specially the glass
 By only complaint is that the top of the phone looks just like the bottom
 Only includes the phone and a slow 500mA charge plus a couple of leaflets

 The only thing i have to complain is the him reader put by mistake a naso him inside the reader and trying to remove it I broke the reader.No part replacement even at the official technical service bought a new one
}
{
Alejandro V.
 To the 31 days it started to fail
 The camera is awful and doesn focus correctly
 The card reader went crazy and damaged mi micro card.Finnaly the seller was not kind and I had to talk with Motorola.Incredibly awful!!!
}
{

 Love love love this phone
 It has replaced my shone 4. I dont miss in one bit
 AT&T has not pushed the lollipop update yet but KitKat is great
 its a bit bigger than the shone 6. Wish it had g LTE, but for $179 its a fantastic buy
}
{
Punkn
 His is a great full features budget phone
 Must get notice that it is now available with Os LTE, but with a five inch screen
 Have enough trouble finding pockets for this 4.5 inch one and it seems more than fast enough for my needs
}
{

 Fire phone is better option when it comes to how much you pay and what you get!Update: after adding the external micro os card to my phone and wife phone phone is now supper slow
 I was not expecting this disappointed
}
{
Jeandrelico
 Even with the 1GB of ram him not feeling noticeable lack on this phone
 Dual front speakers are awesome and the screen colors are very good
 It even doesn feel like a cheap phone
 Would recommend this phone if you need a budget phone

 I got this phone for my son and he hasn put it down yet
 He loves it and hasn asked for a newer phone yet
 He had no problems adding the phone to our existing phone carriers
 Of I could only keep him focused while doing homework
}
{
A. Kumar
 Very nice phone
 A bit slippery so be careful with it but really nice great battery and good sound
 By previous phone was Google Nexus 4. His is a step up not because of processor but because it has space to put the Memory Hard
}

 Battery life is good took

 Ought this to replace my Nexus 4 which met a very unfortunate end
 so far I am very happy with tone
 thing i noticed thought as i use it to track my cycling is it seems to get a GPS fix much faster than my Nexus did
}
{
Meno
 By first one I ordered on here had to be returned since my SIM card would not fit in the slot for some reason.The replacement works great and have been loving it
 Glad I got this for $150 instead of the Moto X for $400.

 Well I bought this to sadly replace my "flagship" phone that was less than two years old and never got the first updated
 Despite having better speck the flagship phone is considerably slower and just unpleasant to use compared to the Moto Os
 To far I like the phone and am getting around 8 legs of speed in my area even without LTE which is plenty fast for any normal use
 Screen is nice bright and responsive even outside
 Its in hand and pocket nicely with no need for case or anything like that
 Was a built in os radio turner which is super cool and a throwback to the first smartphones.
 The speakers are superb in my opinion for a cell phone.Have to subtracted one star for lack of LTE thought even though HSPA+ is plenty fast enough there really is no excuse to release a phone in 2014 without an LTE radio
 8 figs is also quite a low amount of storage os card support although nice is no substitute for on board storage
 Would have gladly paid more for LTE and more storage

 The camera is better than last years model but the screen looks less vibrant, lots of bags with lollipop 5.0.2 and the battery is woeful.I watched a hour movie and that took down 52℅ of battery on full brightness
}
{
Corey
 Absolutely fantastic phone
 Its not an expensive phone but it sure seems like one
 Not my 64GB os card in it taking pick and adding music
 Battery life is great and phone comes packed with features

 I really love this products
 its easier to use and lighter than iPhone.
 The image and sound quality is great
 The only thing is the camera is not good enough but considering its low prices still want to give it five stars
 its smart in spending money to buy this product instead of iPhone.

 A great expensive Android phone
 I had to get a Micro-SIM card from T-Mobile ( $9.99 ) to replace my full-sized one
 It does pretty much everything that an Phone or Samsung does for a small fraction of their prices
