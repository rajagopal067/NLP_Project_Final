 His phone is awesome in its price range and this phone will also get andros lollipop update.compare to Samsung flagship phone which cost 4 time of moto g didn guarantee that will update to lollipop.
 this phone use pure andros ui so no ugly touchwiz ui and no dem apes which reduce phone performance

 Key Us !
 I ordered this phone after a long research.No need to mention the specification and all.Yo can read it elsewhere have been using this phone for fifteen days now l list out the pro and sons which I felt
 PROS : 1.Stock Android so definitely a much better interface than its peers.(not to forget a guaranteed upgrade to Android L is on the cards 2.Very Impressive Camera 3.Decent Round Quality 4.Good Design and Looks
 CONS : 1.Less Battery Lockup 2.One os of RAM might be a downside for the extensive games os Final Verdict : @13k its definitely a bang for the buck !
 To for it if you use your phone as a phone not a gaming device.And last but not the least you'll get some stunning series too thanks to a 2 os front snapped

 First of all starting from boxing,it was pretty standard boxing,nothing special
 The box includes a charger but the wire is not USB to micro-USB,it is simply a wall charger,so you cannot plug it into your lawton or anything
 Then,there are earphones,which have nice sound quality as expected but its not great as you would expect,but the downside is that they are not comfortable.So,be ready to buy another pair if you want to enjoy your music,or if you already have one
 Coming to the deal,the phone is absolutely worth every single penny spent
 The display is sharp and good color reproduction,the front facing dual speakers also sound good.It has a built-in equalizer which works flawlessly.
 The voice quality of calls and active noise cancellation is also good
 But the downfall,the camera
 It is where Motorola cut the prices and its fairly obvious wont say the camera quality is bad,but its not great.There is NOISE.Even in good lighting conditions,there is noise also find the shutter speed a bit slow on the default camera pp but that issue can be resolved by trying some other decent photography apps.Other than that,the camera is finest has good color reproduction,focus sometimes maybe a problem,but generally works fine.The slow-mo video somehow I find is lagged
 Coming to the battery
 Its fairly good,but neither great.Heavy usage will last you 5-7 hours on 100% charge.But for normal use,it works just perfect,it would last you through a day very easily
 The phone candles almost all of the apes and intense games perfectly,with exception of OCCASIONAL lagged dont know how it does it,but this phone candles some games that other phone with slightly better speck dont even run
 And for the part him most excited about,Motorola announced Android L update for Moto devices soon
 To sum up would say if you have made your mind to buy this phone,go for it without a second thought,its the best one you could get out there for its price point,and its not even chinese

 I am satisfied with all the features of moto g and genet
 Firstly It comes with a 8 up primary camera that allows you to click fine he pick
 Secondly it comes with dual audit speakers that is really appreciable

 The charger gets heated up very quickly
 Finally i am satisfied with overall performance of my mobile

 Must brought Moto G and Men few days back
 All the features are excellent except that one basic function that is of VIDEO CALL, is MISSING.
 Known and NOT os POPULAR BRANDS in the same segment offers this basic function on their handset.
 Literally surprised how could a brand like MOTOROLA miss/ignore such basic requirements
 His is just a glorified or a modified version of MOTO G must genet we shouldn be calling this MOTOROLA mobile as GEN 2. A bit disappointment
 Thank U...

 I have been using this phone since 20days.
 It is a very good phone under 15K budget
 Rose 1. 8MP Back 2MP front camera
 2. Sterno speaker
 3. Loud & clear voice no signal problems
 4. Full charge in 1.5 hours at max 5.
 More than average battery life
 Battery drops to 40% from full charge if used continuously for 4-5hours on data packet mode
 But When you do not use it for getting or gaming purpose then battery back is too good you will hardly need to charge again on same day
 Overall charging needed once a day if used efficiently
 6. OTG support
 Sons 1. Camera quality is lesser than that of Micromax Canvas os Plus on my personal experience after using both the phones.)
 2. To USB provided with Shone
 3. Headphone quality is not good
 4. Overhearing of charge
 Overall One can Buy this Shone its really good to buy
 After using it I ordered 2 more MOTO Os to gift to my relatives
 2.
}
{
Shubha Samal
 The overall look is good but the drawback are more 1.
 A bit heavy for the size 2. Matter back-up is very less
 3. Shone heat up very fast very difficult to talk for long time his any one can u pus tell me how to increase the battery back

 Please do not send the product by "Delivary Services They do not know how to handle the products .
 In front me they are thronging the products hear and there which are need to deliver to the customers
 When asked do you know what products are in the boxes they answered " so what we will do like that " os For for my surprise the box is for me Immediately how dare you do then said id product got damaged you return it to flipkat" by this you can understand how these people are
 In front of me Filpkart guns and Amazon guns are delivery the product in a good manner and taking care of each product .
 I request you that please send the products through Flipkart's part but not other services who are least gathered of the products delivered
 I am giving only star not for the product but for the service which Flipkart has chosen
 I came to know that this Salivary service is the worst By brother also faced some issue with the same guns in the past

 I will rate the battery 4/10 on 24 hours demanding battery life

 I had ordered Moto grand gen),the black one,and in two days received the package.well
 packed and sophisticated delivered.Once opening the box,u'll find the hands at the top of it without any protection sheet(although it doesn need that as it has a gorilla glass 3).With 2 days of fairly usage i can suggest this hands to anyone seeking a hands from an international brand within 15-16k.The handed is curved from the back so that it looks sleek at the edges and gives a premium feel.The dual front speakers agent too loud one might be expected but sound quality is above average.The 1 The quadcore delivers smooth performance.The 8 os camera camera click good quality picture after resecting it to 8MP(default will be 6MP),but i really likes the front one,i.e of 2 os but click crisp and sharp pictures,detailing of the object is very fine for both the camera
 In the box accessories includes a charger and a earphone,but i am literally not impressed by the earphones audit quality as i use high bass earphones generally,but may be ok for most of the people
 The phone comes preinstalled with gonemad music player(best music player for me),whatsapp,way2sms pp and ff messenger
 Well i am happy enough to have one in my hand.....

Dr Kailash Rathi
 Not this on 22 Kept
 The phone is absolutely amazing
 All the good things I want to say about this lovely phone is already been said by other users I shall be repeating all over
 But the charger and the earphones provided along with are absolutely horrible
 The charger gets heated up excessively and I cannot charge my phone during travel in trains
 The phone starts behaving strange home screen icons positions changed automatically emergency call screen pips up when I want to clock phone
 And the earphones are of such a low quality I would be thankful to Motorola if they least provide such earphones with better sound quality and also which have a sponge cover which would least stay in the ear after head movements
 5/5 for the phone 1/5 for charger 0.25/5 for earphones.

 The Moto go is really good looking and handy,though the screen is of 5 inch.This takes an edge on other smart phone with 5 inch display.Here are the observations
 1)The incoming/outgoing voice quality is good
 2)The screen resolution is very good with quality display
 3)Speakers take an edge sounding with quality while playing music
 4)Enough memory of 16gb that enables user to store adequate roof apes and stuff
 5)The battery performance is average

 Moto g 2014 is the budget phone
 i have purchased this phone recently look wise good looking screen is not full os but image quality is good
 its ok for the budget phone sound is high but clarity is not there its breaking when you listen song in high volume
 using g network battery will end at end of the day
 till now i have not install any game in this so i have to install and test whether it will work or not
 camera is good i have taken phone in night its flash work grm not so good quality but as compare to micromax into its good
 over all i would say its grm budget phone

 I ordered the white colored Moto G and Men for my brother and it was deliver in a day
 Coming to the product it really offers great bang for buck
 It has been almost a month and I haven seen even a hint of any last
 It runs almost quite smooth with fluid operation twitching between apes and pages is smooth with some occasional but noticeable shutters
 Camera is good in well lit and outdoor conditions
 Display is good with sufficient clarity and good viewing angle
 For moderate to mix usage battery gives a back up of around 15 his which is good enough in my opinion
 Volumes through the speaker is loud,crisp and clear and doesn get distorted
 By only complain is that no data cable is provided with the hands and headphone is just average
 I would have also preferred Motorola to retain the screen size of 4.5 inch from the previous version
 All in all this phone is a good buy absolute value for money
 To for it!!!

 I ordered this Black colour model on Act and in this webster and i got this mobile on th october by option Wash on delivery as dussek and gandhi jayanthi are holidays and followed by the weekend
 In Monday i received my package
 I started using from the evening after i kept charging initially for more than 3 hours i started using it and it is big relief to me that from last 2 and half years i was using 2 mobile for my official and personal numbers
 Now i had a dual him moto g phone which is fit for my pocket
 Plus points of this mobile are 1. Value for the money
 You can get better features in any branded model with this prices
 2. The camera with 8 megapixel is really amazing for both pictures and video
 3. The internal memory is 16 go which has lot of space to store lot of applications
 4. The voice calls have a clarity and no noise difference
 5.
 The 5'' display and touch performance are really good
 6.
 The data connection and the internet browsing is good
 7. He have all the goose application built in this and they are working in a good condition
 Sinus points of this mobile are 1. Battery back for this mobile is not so accurate if we use applications using data connection i observed the battery is discharging so fast
 2. He can put may audit songs as the ring tones
 He will get some default ringtones in the mobile which we can get one nice ring tone
 3.
 They are only 2 Motorola service centers in Hyderabad.
 4. And in this model the battery is built with the mobile we canst remove it if we have a problem with battery we must hanover the entire mobile to service center
 From last 10 days i observed these good and bad features in my mobile
 Of i find any interesting features i will updated
 Thanks ANIL DANDU

 I have purchased Moto G(2nd genu on th October 2014.
 After starting the phone I see one area where the colors are fading and showing white color in a big point have made a replacement request.But in cracking option it is showing Stem has been packed from with October.They are saying I will get the replacement item within with October
 I am very much disappointed for this kind of bad service

 phone performance is good....1gb ram is good....battery performance is avarage.....bt one disadvantage is that the mob does not have file manager...but you can download the pp name called os file explorer...bt for one doubt is that if my phone hang means wat can i do???because the battery is built so that i cannot take the battery out....other than this the mobile is best...camera clarity is awesome...hd recording is also good...

 I ordered this on a Friday night and got it the next day so great service by flipkart.
 I had been looking for s good smartphone for some time and the G immediately caught my eyes
 The best in class at the moment is the Xiaomi MI3, which is next to impossible to get in India now so the next bet is the Motorola moto Os
 Other options:The Us Zenfone 5 or the micromax Canvas Nitro.
 While the asks and into are good took the into is a ll better than the G in terms of Opens but most probably wont get the Android L updated which is really important
 Design The G is beautifully built with amazing feel in the hands with its curved back.It doesn slip from your hand at all and is the best built in comparison to the moto G UI: The moto g runs stock andros 4.4.4 and I have never experienced a lag even with 6-7 apes open at once
 The phone has been built to run Stock Android and doesn lag at all offering a smooth user experience Display:A crisp 720p os display is quite impressive with gorilla glass which is not offered on the Canvas Nitro.
 It is virtually scratch proof
 Specs: Must look at the speck given online that should satisfy you
 Camera It has a decent camera for the money you are paying
 It doesn offer a a camera as good as the shone os which is obvious
 Battery Its a pretty good battery back and i got 12-13 hours on its with the If on a times and off at other times
 Overall Verdict It is an excellent phone and in my personal opinion better than the Micromax Canvas Nitro.
 Must buy it if you have the money

Gaurav Chakrab...
 order on big billion day!..got it for 8999 for an exchange but still 12999 is too perfect..!..i have used it for 7 days and still no problems
 processing speed is good mixed with the 1 go ram and aren 320 graphics...front speakers covered with carbon fibre is solid for good condition of sound(both for call and external sound)..8mp camera is decent for the price and front camera is also ok for average series and normal video chat...though battery is non-removable but you wont find it an issue but it gives for over 1.5 days standby with some calls back with above 90% charge and 10-12 his with continuous wife or g browsing video playing and 7-8 his with continuous gaming..so that may be an issue for multimedia users..approx 13gb internal memory unable
 I like the expandable memory features
 I also liked the ok google' feature of andros mitka with exciting other motorola apes like motor assist motor migrate'(great for connecting or miracasting any other device motor voice motor connect'(u can use this pp for the connecting device with the mobile etc
 His is a stock andros phone with guaranteed software update and it has almost all goose apes by default..its really very useful!..the he display is decently brighter than average midrange smartphone and u can use the mobile pretty well keeping the brightness to zero..screen is well protected by morning gorilla glass 3..touch interface is the best as well and its a bit weighty than average smartphone.
 Other common features of the phone is good and better in some cases than any other smartphone in this range
 there is no such negative issue for me with this mobile but i wish it could have the 'NFC' and a more battery power..something like 2300-2600 mAh..;-p so overall i am satisfied by using this handy set and would surely recommend to any mid-range smartphone buyers...coz this the best in class set in its price!!!!

Sudhanshu Shekhar
 Must received my phone last weeks
 him happy with its performance and looks
 1. Screen Vice crisp and vivid but only 720p.
 With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p.
 It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and unable in single hand
 2. Performance Android 4.4.4
 comes pre-installed.
 Lag-free so far
 Guns Riptide os pretty well
 Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400.
 os Officer Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine
 3. Round The front dual speakers are awesome.
 Very nice sound
 One of the other Boots (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity
 4. Camera 8 os main cam & 2 os front
 Very good snap so far both indoors and outdoor
 Not only 20 mind to experiment os 5.
 All quality 2 miss with noise cancellation and a loud speaker
 Feels good
 6. Micro os Clot His is the greatest inclusion
 Moto G sorely missed that
 Good option

 I have ordered for two Moto G and Men phone and i got it after 4 day
 One of the phone has a slight scratch above the volume button and also when keeping both the phone side by side the display screen color(when display is off is different
 Hence i have asked for a replacement as i am not sure whether it is genuine or a used piece which was delivered
 Now waiting for the replacement from past days from flipkar, not sure how long will it take
 Over all Moto G and gen is great phone except no NFC and no user-replaceable battery

 Been using the device for a week now
 I would say the battery back up is not great
 The UI is too stock
 They could have allowed us to add custom tongues to the quick settings
 The normal twitching off and on of mobile data seems to be a chorea
 You cannot even enable battery percent view by default in the status bar from the battery pp
 You need to install third party apes to overcome this and it unnecessarily takes up 30-40 os of valuable RAM.
 The multitasking control is too vigorous
 Of you open more than 5 apes and you move to the the it reload and clears the th one from the memory
 His happens to the extent that it closes of music player
 The music abruptly stops due to this
 They could've added 1.5 os RAM for this device it would have improved the multitasking capabilities
 The camera UI pretty bad
 When you take pictures and wipe right to view it there is last
 Motorola needs to fix this soon
 The software is thoroughly under cooked
 It just makes root such a necessity sadly we will root warrant once it is rooted The build quality is very good and that Moto dimple at the back that
 To cover can to justice to that
 The battery temperature is constantly getting above 40C if you use Os with location services enabled
 I am sure this is a software related issue
 I bought this only because there is a guaranteed upgrade to Android Os Of that is your priority please buy it

 I also bought the first gen Moto Os
 The obvious adds are the screen size and the memory add on via os cards Although the extensive memory was a good idea the size needn have changed
 Given that this is still not full HD, the smaller phone not only had a hide fixed per inch it was also easier to operate with one hand

Aswath Narayana
 I bought this product Moto G and Men as part of launch day
 The phone worked perfectly fine for next 2 weeks
 After that it started getting switched off frequently
 I called Flipkart immediately to replace the phone for that they took 4 days time for a technical to call me back
 I got a call from Flipkart technical saying do the hard rest of the phone
 After the hard rest of the phone the phone works for one more weeks
 When again the same problems
 Flipkart doesn even bother to call me and check if their solution worked fine
 Flipkart reduced the cost of this phone to 8500 rubles on the big billion day
 I am pretty sure many of the customer with this phone are facing one or the other issues
 Please email me aswath08@gmail.com.
 He can jointly take a legal action on Motorola and Flipkart.

 The Moto G(2nd genu might not be thought of as a revolutionary update but it certainly packs a punch
 Smooth user interface
 stock 4.4.4
 Android KitKat.
 It comes pre loaded with a launched which is identical to the Google Now Launched on Nexus honest
 It has all the features except the Google Now home screen on the left of the home screen page
 Hats even better is that it comes with a guaranteed Android L Updated
 To sum up its a smooth interface with a almost stock User interface
 A good buy compare to the Other phone in this price Bracket

 I have bought this exchanged with older phone for k off from lip part on its Pale day
 Flipkart took little more time than normal to deliver the products
 The Performance of the phone is pretty good
 Its Faaaast, Long Battery life which last one full day even with extensive use of the screen its performing much much Letter than my prior phone Samsung S3.
 Duel SIM and external os port is an add on features
 Certainly it has few cost Camera performance is very poor Round quality is not crisp as you expect
 Brightness is too low in Auto mode Need to keep the brightness in manual mode always
 I didn like the power and volume up down buttons are not sturdy
 new steel bars over speakers agent go well with the design earlier moto G is better looking phone
 Over all its very good buy considering its phenomena operating speed A better buying experience as always with FK.

Karthikeyan Na...
 For the Mobile Speck I would give a rating of 4. But the disability and quality of the phone is very poor and questionable
 The phone comes with Morning Gorilla Glass 3 protection but i do not see a Gorilla Roughness in there
 I have purchased this phone on the Fig Million May by exchanging my Bony Peri Arc Os which i was so much resistant to change due to the display contrast and audit quality of Bony as I love it
 Finally I made up my mind and placed the order
 Not the phone delivered the very next day
 Not impressed with the phone bigger display and newer andros version
 Equipped it with Lip cover screen guards
 But the happiness did not long last
 The very next day the phone slipped off my hand around 2 foot from the ground
 I thought os it is a little fall worried about the scratch and took the phone but surprisingly the phone top screen cracked HOW FRAGILE os IS!!! which can resist a 2 foot fall in a normal surface By XPERIA would have fallen from my hand a 100 times it never broken
 Were the worst part comes after frustration of cracking my one day old phone without using much contracted flipkart.
 They denied replacement as it is a physical damaged
 Contracted service center they do not have stock parts available
 They have other products which they will replace the complete display and protection glass which cost around 8000 Os (Flipkart recommended service center
 I have purchase this phone itself for 8000 after exchange
 Later on surging through the internet came to know that lot of people has this problem with Moto Os
 A mobile comes with approve 13,000, at least should have better disability and quality and should have better post purchase service
 But with this phone you dont get any of this just a FANCY MOBILE for lesser prices
 Were is my advice 1. Purchase this phone if you love it but keep it safe more than your child
 os NOT DROP os EVEN ONCE. 2. There is no stock parts available for replacement
 Either Flipkart nor Motorola helps you
 Unlike in US, they replace the display for free
 3. The service charges and repairs for this phone costs you more than the phone prices
 BEWARE.

 Battery charging time is more than 3 and a half hours and if you use internet while charging then it will take more than 4 hours to charge assuming start from 10 - 15 % of battery
 His is something new to me that you canst use your phone while charging
 Also it is not giving good back at even Os so with Os you can imagine
 Performance of the phone is good , no last
 Camera is good and even display is fine
 Problem is only with battery

 Dear interface
 To unwanted applications
 Amazing fast battery recharging.
 After using Galaxy Os for last two years had discomfort for the first few days now able to get accustomed to moto G2.
 Not a very good deal with the buyback of Foka E63.
 In gathering I found Moto Os - tireless strength of Os to be far lower than that of Samsung S2.

 I have ordered MOTO G and Men on big billion day (COD) but i misplaced one more order could not cancel my another order though i have mailed/called your customer care
 Last Saturday both mobile came in single parcel and the delivery boy said " I canst open the parcel Of i opened you should pay and he said Os will contact you after asking my manager and next day there was no response from him even i called him and my order was canceled and i didn get the mobile
 I agree that was my mistake to place one wrong order but you must provide some option to correct these kind of mistakes by customer even that is on your hell sales day
 Now i lost the offer on the mobile which i need to buy

 I was looking for a not too expensive phone and wanted most of the features of a high-end phone in it
 Previous gen Moto G didn had a memory card sloth
 His was one of the biggest disadvantage of it
 Some of the pro of this phone is os It has an expandable memory option os The primary camera quality is very good
 os Even the secondary camera quality is good
 I even tried type calling from this phone and the video quality was unto my expectations
 os The display of the phone looks nice os It comes with a kind of scratch guards so u dont have to purchase one Sons os The headphones should have been in the ear type
 I usually prefer the in the ear type os Battery life is OK.
 But this is a fault with most of the andros devices
 They do consume a lot of battery To far so good
 It has got a lot of high end phone features and it comes with pretty reasonable prices

 Have been using this phone for the last 15 days
 Not a WOW phone !
 cross --------- - Price is affordable.
 - Product design is okay Not Excellent
 - Speaker sound is better than my other Samsung Galaxy Shone
 - os Display - To lagging - Auto brightness is perfect
 Sons --------- Battery back is really bad
 I use g network fulltime.
 To gazing no call longer than 10 minutes daily Only browsing on internet
 The battery lasts only 5hrs.
 And you need another 4 he to charge it !
 - When compared to my Samsung Galaxy the Network Signal reception capacity is weak
 - Volume and power buttons are not userfriendly.
 - Data Connection automatically misses often
 - Micro him os - To USB cable - Microphone sound quality not excellent
 - Display quality could have improved
 - Motorola Flipcover is too expensive (1700/-).
 1200 os is unfordable !
 Flipkart and os Detail - 10/10 for delivery
 I will update review later os

 Must received my phone last weeks
 him happy with its performance and looks
 Was stunned by its looks for the first time
 Its seems big if you were using a small phone (3.5") before
 Camera is awesome, both front and back
 Its auto-focus is amazing since it is able to focus on things kept very very close to the phone
 The only drawback I can think of is him not able to set a may as its ringtone.
 You can only use the default tones given in the phone as ringtones.!! Part from that its a very NICE PHONE, GOOD BATTERY back-up, until you remember to CHARGE YOUR PHONE FULL before SWITCHING os os for the FIRST TIME!

 The new motorola moto G and Men is damn good for its cost ... looks and designs are so cool , sound effects are just simply superb , the matter finish and white color is just lovely os love this mobile very much , so fast , and mitka version of andros is just awesome Battery back is decent ... one minus point is the battery charger and headsets of moto G is just in average ... charger takes up some more time for charging .... Overall : WORTH FOR IT'S COST ... BEST ANDROID SMARTPHONE UNDER 15,000

 Called many times to customer care but they were delayed the issue for more than a weeks
 After they provide some troubleshooting steps the problem was rectified but just after one day the problem was still persisting
 After the complaint they had replaced my phone with a new one
 The New phone was working fabulous as of 2 days before but now i can see the previous problem is still there is this hands as well
 Very frustated.... totally unhappy from flipkart and services.... waiting for somebody to come and take this bullshit product....

 Awesome phone with awesome price !!!
 The new moto g and gen has surly come out with the laguna of moto g gen os which was lacking a good camera quality and storage space
 otherwise moto g rocks one cannot resist on falling in love with the mobile
 Being a gale its always cool and fashionable to carry the awesome back cover colors offered by moto go
 Fact nothing can beat the quality of original lip cover
 The part is when you close the lip your phone also gets locks so need to lock your phone for privacy separately your lip will do it for you
 Battery life of moto g gen 1 and 2), which was one of the major requirement of smart phone is great and last for a day and half when charged fully
 Case of access phone speed motorola assist sound quality everything awesome.Worth a smart phone
 However m bit disappointed by the os retainers , not for the product quality but for the shipment time they took to ship the products
 In site they are mentioning that they deliver the phone with in 2-3 business days how ever they took nearly on week in my cases inspire of being delivered in retro city only
 The courier service EKART Logistics is worst i have seen .
 They are not dating their shipment status for 24 his and no contact not to contact the courier company even if you get your phone call to their customer support they will keep on you waiting and no representative will be available for you for 10 Min!! and cherry on the cake is you will pay the call cost even for waiting...
 I really dont know why the reputed site like flipkart use cheap courier service

 i prefer to this phone instead of samson or nikita as it has better features than these to company honest
 these companies have excellent phone in price range of above 20k.
 but moto go has all of it in just 13k.so go forward and buy.........

 i have used this product for 2 days and it proved to be the best in the series
 the moto g 2 has a crisp 5 inch display best for gazing
 no laws for hardware gazing
 sometimes display heat a little while charging the phone
 but not a big issue
 8 up camera is wonderful
 editing is also good apes which Google and Motorola gave are very good and helpful
 i totally prefer this phone to youngsters who have ambitions to buy above 20000 os overall a excellent smartphone by Motorola.

 Shone is running smoothly with no issues
 I checked for everything immediately after delivery there were no smudge marks
 It was neatly packed and sealed
 Another quality product by Motor
 i have been using it for about 1 month now
 Wont buy MotoG2 covers from flipkart, they are very expensive here
 You can get them for 150 Os outside
 Only con is battery drains out while using Os continuously but i guess that happens in any phone while Os browsing

 Moto G and Men Shone is very good in following terms
 1. Good rear camera(only x room 2. Good secondary camera
 I click some very good self
 3. os display is doing good job
 Even I set my display in low mode
 Of you are in inside roof this this low light god wont let you complaint
 4. Battery life is not average but not also good
 You can pass half day with fully charged battery
 Os play game a lot and use internet very frequently with go 5. Two front speakers do very good job for what they meant for
 Problem with the phone
 1.
 I found very serious issue with network selection between g and go
 I found that there is no setting that you can select only GSM(2g) or WCDMA(3g) mode as per your requirements
 His is the only thing that I dont like in this phone
 Otherwise this phone can fulfilled all my requirements

Anuj Samad
 Ordered my moto g and gen on th October and Flipkart delivered it on the
 Good build quality
 His phone has a real class touch on it the back of the phone adds a premium touch to it
 Touch is superb
 The device works great till now games like temple run 2 run smoothly no last
 To problems with web browsing and streaming he video
 Doesn't heat up while playing high end games like most other honest
 Vice crisp screen but only 720p works for me
 A decent camera good pictures both indoors and outdoor
 HDR included
 Although there are not a lot of camera controls or additional features courtesy of stock android) The front dual sterno speakers are just awesome, they produce loud and clear sound
 Battery discharges faster on g but everyone knows that **Cons - The only thing that I would like to point out is that the charger provided with it tends to heat the device a little while charging
 Coming to the point and not talking about the speck of this phone Moto G gen 2 is a really impressive smartphone probably the best in this price range first time andros users will simply love it
 Motorola has provided a great phone at a decent prices

 His is inform you that I was eligible for old phone exchange offer of Rs2000 during the Millennium offer under exchange
 During Delivery the person had delivered the product and he had taken the old phone without giving back the exchange amount ( Os 2000 ) to my spouse by giving wrong information .
 Same was informed to you callender by spouse and today ( also I had spoken to You call center executive and reference no 1410103021970.
 Request you to check why the delivery person had taken the phone without giving the amount Rs2000 .
 Ll ensure this is taken up strongly and need back my old phone or amount Rs2000 needs to be refused .
 Ll ensure this done on top priority .

 I have been using a Gumma set until 2 days back when I got this new set throw Flipkart.
 Yesterday I shot a video for 2 mind duration
 The set heated up severely
 To wondering if it will burn the set if I carried on for another 2-3 mind
 Even the light starts to flicked during this duration
 Ought this set with a lot of hope to have a set with new features
 The features are very good easy to handle
 But experience on day 1 itself was not good
 An a guide from Moto help me solve this issue immediately

 Before I get into my review for this particular products I have to once mention the horrible customer service experience I received from Flipkart.
 It was excruciating in itself but all not rate the product down because of that
 Now about Moto G and genu its an excellent products especially for its prices
 its been almost 20 days now have been using it and I hardly have anything to complain about
 Rose 1. Very smooth interface
 Thus far have had no lag or hanging issue
 The Snapdragon 400 might be an raging teach but it still does the job well
 2. Adreno 305 shows its capable hand here
 Gaming has been great so far
 have thrown games like Shalt os If 14 etc and it has had no problem handling them
 3. Battery
 Yes its a good one at least for someone with my type of usage
 After some gaming (approx 1-1.30
 hours may be few calls through the day always on Os and I mean always on internet few video worth an os movie it runs for almost 1 and half day 4. Screen
 Morning Gorilla Glass 3. I have no screen guard at present (I've never liked them though I am thinking all get one but it seems I need not worry as there have been no signs of scratching etc all still get a screen guard thought
 Not that From Camera its average
 However I dont think its necessarily a problems
 its responsive and takes good enough snap
 I am coming from Xperia's 12 os shorter anyway so may be I am based against this one
 Os signal reception I had some problem here
 It would constantly switch to Edge or Os even if Os signal is available
 I got around it fine though by changing the setting to Os only just dial *#*#4636#*#*-->phone information and select WCDMA only to do that because it wont give you that option through Settings).
 All clarity is good through
 Overall its a solid piece from Motor

 First time I had very bad experience with Flipkart.
 Order was delivered late and to maintain SLA they have increased delivery time in their system
 When I contracted Flipkart, I got very arrogant reply
 I am giving zero start to Motorola as they are sticking with Flipkart only
 I wanted to buy MOTO X Men 2 but I dont want to buy any thing on Flipkart.

 I am Note 3 user
 I bought this Moto G for my dad
 After seeing it i decided i will give it a try and boy this phone has proved that speck doesn matter for real life usage
 NFS most wanted Virtue tennis Subways suffers etc u name it and it plays with zero lag and less loading time
 stock Android 4.4.4 is awesome, fluid and no last
 I opened least 12 apes and no lag or shortage of memory Only On is Battery back is little less but that oka
 every smartphone today needs 2 times charge
 To no minus points for that
 Overall best buy

 But the replacement product is really working well Must buy product of the year... Totally worth it value

 Product is no doubt good
 Delivery was quite fast appreciable
 When comes to th accessories, why the ear phone looks so cheap
 War phone certainly do not match the elegance of the mobile
 Moto you needs to be replaced with one with its standard For Lip part guns you need to send and extra copy of voice with the package inside the package box other than one stick to the package box
 It will no doubt help the end user in future
 Good product and a excellent service

 I ordered two phone separately on big billion day and was skeptically whether i would get it fast or not.....Eventhough i received one faster than the other flipkart still delivered them before the promised date....Have been using the phone for a day...feels good and perform good....overall good product...my only complaint would be that the moto people could've made data cable and charger as separate units.....

 Part 1 Purchased on Fig Million May Pale under the exchange offer entitled to discount of Os 2,000/-.
 The offer was erroneously missed by FlpKrt at the time of payment and I felt created
 But after followed and apologies from FlpKrt, the refund has been created to my Mallet Account
 Thankyou and I am back on board as a loyal customers
 Part 2 With an additional 10% discount on Citibank CC, the Moto Os finally cost me Os 9,700/-.
 First impressions - Full value for money
 Excellent build quality
 Display The os screen is good brightness and richness is good
 Viewing angles are acceptable
 Round All volumes are good speakers are acceptable and not very loud
 Platform and UI: UI is very minimalistic and therefore the operations are super smooth
 To laws whatsoever
 The touch is also very smooth
 Very good If and 3G, no laws and disconnections.
 Several apes can run smoothly together - i tested Whatsapp, FB, browsing and mails all on wifi).
 Camera Was a disappointment
 Even with 8 map the clarity expected is missing
 Downloaded the Google Camera Pp it gives better fussing option but reduces the capture angle but is better than the stock pp
 The 2 pg front camera is just possible and ok for occasional selfish
 The flash does some work in low light but nothing wonderful
 os CAMERA is your MOST IMP consideration - i would not recommend this phone
 Naming Am not into heavy gaming but regular ones like Bandy Rush Subways Surfer, Anti Bananas, Angry Birds run fine
 To issues
 Battery With given usage - 1 he calls 3 his browsing inch multimedia on wife 1/2 he gazing 1/2 he Os browsing - the phone later more than a day
 Was down to 20% at end of day from 100% am to 10 pmb
 I would rate it very good
 Verdict Good big screen phone super smooth ok camera and full value for money
 Excellent option for normal users

 The Words have really proved itself
 His is the first time I bought something Online first I was scared about if the product will have a defect or something else like these so many questions came in my mind but Flipkart just failed it
 Flipkart has made me believe on Online Shopping and the Moto delivers its best in this mobile
 It has everything a costly mobile would have but it has a cheap price and a beast machine even my os doesn have a more powerful Graphics Hard than this of the mobile
 Love Flipkart and the Moto G and Gen).

 First Oats off to Flipkart for the fattest delivery of the products

 Coming to the phone It is outstanding
 The white color model looks splendid and feels great in hands
 os weight issue at all
 Buds to Motorola for paying heed to users reviews and demands and incorporating them in the and gen device
 Features 1. Display quality is fantastic and crystal clear
 2.Dual metal front speakers produces great sound
 Round in earphone is nice too and can be enhanced with audit effects
 3. Device performance is really awesome.
 Multiple apes works well with no lag issue
 4. 8 os rear camera takes fantastic photos . 2 os front camera works well with type and for series .
 Over all It is a great feature-rich device at a reasonable and unfordable prices

SAMEER PAGARE
 Flipkart - Os expected before time delivery with safe & fully packed box
 Moto Os - Brought on Million day hopping of getting any discount but was unlucky for the same
 About the one - 1. Yes It is Bigger brighter & better than Moto G Men 1 2. Camera quality is too awesome (Panoramic, Slur mode flash 3. Video clarity is also nice with slow motion recording
 4. Same - Lay any game without facing any issues
 All games work on the device 5. Mitka - Needs to update the phone over 120 os for Mitka 4.4.4 6. Duel Him : Micro Him red
 I faced a issue inserting SIM card as it his not clear which side needs to be insert
 7. K Google - Works os over Os 8. Screen - Slide to left & you have all the into of current location climate nearest restaurant etc 9. Meeting Sleep mode
 10.
 Battery life is good
 Below are the few points which are resisting my love towards moto Os 1. Heating problem 2. Moto Go - I was expecting it as Moto X2.
 I am owning Moto X also
 Please find my review on moto X on Moto X forum

 His one is a little on the heavier side
 Gros is all covered already by other reivewers.
 Sons - the voice quality is very bad hardly audible in a room with some background noise
 Second the hands speaker is to the right side of the phone - it is very difficult in case you have a habit of holding phone to your left ear as the phone needs to be adjusted up to be able to get clear voice
 Third - this hands speaker is the same as the loudspeaker, which makes the voice not so easy on ears and the person around can easily listen / overhear the conversation

 His is an amazing device
 Nothing more to say than the earlier positive reviews this device has received
 Have been using this for the last few days
 Doesn't heat easily unlike the other andros phone I had previously used
 Battery is sufficient for my daily usage
 The device perform impeccably.
 The display is sharp and clear even with the increase in screen size
 Must disappointed with the lack of quality accessories over the web
 Well it should take time
 Anyways, special mention to Flipkart : I purchased this device through the exchange offer with a probable 2000 discount
 When they failed to pick up the old phone from me they immediately refused an amount of 1000 to my Flipkart wallet
 Not sure of others but Flipkart has never failed me
 Deep it up
 P.S.
 I want bribed to write this review

 Of you want budget phone within ask and every feature like big screen , gaming , good camera then you must go for MOTO G 2ND GEN.
 Battery back is almost 22-28 Hours after using wife game camera music player
 But st time I got damaged speaker then flipkart replace it within 2 days
 than to flipkart.

 The moto g is a nice phone with large screen good built quality and good performance
 The phone perform daily tasks perfectly and the display is nice for watching moves and video
 The phone can handle games like subways suffer minion rush it racing and temple run 2 smoothly and does not heat up much even after long game play
 Battery back is decent and will last for 1 day on moderate usage
 The camera has been the most important update and it takes much better picture than the previous gen model
 In moderate to good lighting conditions it takes decent enough pick with good colour balance
 It is a value for money device at this price though many prefers xiaomi red os at lower prices
 But if you can afford it its much better than red os as it free internal memory around 12.7 go which helps lot while loading big games
 Also the andros 5.0 update will consume much internal memory because of the changed API's so ultimately 16 go internal memory is any day better than go internal memory
 Also it has sterno speakers with good enough sound for entertainment purpose and most importantly it runs stock andros with no customization unlike red os which runs MIUI.
 Stock andros has the advantage to get software upgrade faster and it uses much less ram than skinned up in
 By friend has red os and this takes up much less ram while running apes and games and does not overhead like red os
 Definitely recommended

 Moto G and Men I ordered it on 23 Rep and I got it delivered on 25th.
 Very prompt service by flipkart team
 I got it door delivery
 I appreciate your prompt service
 The pack was very good with maximum safety
 I paid Os 12999/- I gone through the configuration
 Its really excited me
 Even i can not dream the beauty of the hand set and its configuration within this prices .
 Now about the performance of the hand set and the service after sale and guarantee support can be explained after many days of use
 The hand set power switch was damaged during the use
 In 11.10.2014
 I handed over the phone to for the service at ADR Technologies Cochin.
 I got the phone back on 22.11.14.
 Charged Os 1200/- .
 After receiving the phone In noticed a snag,that him 2 slot is not reading
 Again I have to give for service

 Superb product in this price range..just go for it if your budget is within 15000...dont even see any other product...micromax...lava...karbonn can match its performance and feel...remember Motorola is the first company in the world to manufacture a mobile phone...build quality is just superb and speakers are mindblowing...also this time (i.e.

 Flipkart can be more better.It doesn support open delivery
 Of we want to check the item when delivered by the courier guy that whether the device is defective or any kind of problem in it then we canst proceed because they dont allow open delivery....WHY??? By point is that if they allow us to open the box for checking the item then it will be more convenient for customer and supply agency to save a valuable time when the device received defective because we can give the item directly to the courier guy for replacement ease
 it will save the time consumed in failing several times and waiting for their response After all hard earning money can be utilize in a proper way.This right is to be provided to customers

 Over a period of time the society and my job needed some advance features
 I am not a techie.
 I dont know how to use these smart honest
 By two sons use and I never dared to touch them because I am a smart phone illiterates
 I tried many a times in the phone stores to purchase but every time the sales men used to act smart and confuse my mind on every smart phone
 It last I made an adventure through the flipkart and I clicked Moto g and gen phone
 Received after 4 days
 Opened the pack and found....but I dont know how to use it even switch the phone 'on'.
 I always feel bore with the manual
 The manual makes me that it is an Intermediate baths physics chemistry text book kind
 Os I took a deep breath and started meddling with the buttons
 .........................now I am offering my review
 A Very Good Shone indeed which suits my requirements
 I need a phone my mail skype.
 hats it
 The price is very convincing when compared to other models
 His phone could sound as much as 35000 rupees, but through online I could get it for 13000 rupees.
 The battery life is about one complete day with at least 40 above oncoming and outdoing calls 15 minutes of skype, a half an hour mail checking and watching 4 or 5 Rev Anand/Rajesh Khanna/Shammi Poor songs on the youtube.
 That else I need
 I started recommending this phone to my age group...I am 52.
 Deep it up motorola.
 Flipkart..thanks for saving me from smart sales men waste of time and fuel to move around Hyderabad city where finding parking for a car is a hell

 I received the phone and found one of the him card shots not accepting the him cards
 Of you keep the slot pressed the phone recognises the him otherwise it doesn't.
 Motorola should have a more stringent quality control standard when clearing phone for sale
 Waiting flipkart to resolve the issue

 Well what more can one expect at this price..except more RAM...best thing is the ample space..even after all must-have apply I still have 10 os left plus it can have os card and micro-USB... though os wont probably have apply I think it is really not required...
 And I haven seen such a symmetrical phone every besides the front cam and slight weight at the battery side one canst tell top or bottom
 And yes Motorola, or phone will keep us warm during the winters..ha hang must get Battery Doctor and Clean Master...

 yep ! this is the best mid range andros phone for now os PROS os packed with snapdragon 400 os pretty decent enough for this price battery is way better than expected (media-core user am myself very nice display two comes with stock andros experience feels solid best nearly no been dual sterno speakers will blow you away expandable memory guaranteed updated for andros l CONS os camera performance was worse even being equipped with imp only one microphone outdoor visibility could have been better phone doesn come with micro us us cable headphones are cheap by built and audit quality the plastic bells surrounding the top face were quite disappointing making it feel cheap
 but its still the best phone for buck os believe me its like you are using nexus device
 moto is rocking the market now Os !

 the mobile is super and average budget for anyone who can have plan to buy a mobile in 13k, the issue is Mobile display getting heated that u can feel while u keep in packet

 The moto G improves on what its processor lacked micro os card slot,beautiful os inch display and 8MP camera .
 ---------------------Pros *5" display front speakers are loud n clear no network or call drops *8MP camera takes amazing pictures when HDR mode is on micro os slot up to 32gb ----------------------Con's And battery performance is average

 Update : War 2015 Everything was so good until one day the phone got dropped on the floor and the so called Morning Gorilla Glass 3 just shattered across length and breadth
 os my mistake dropping it but then the service center person gave me the biggest shock
 Os 7000 for the glass alone and then additional service charge !
 Thank you Motorolo , I am buying another new phone from your competitors
 The glass and service costs 65% of the mobile price and later to live with fear that this so called gorilla 3 glass will shatter again
 Reducing stars to os ================================================================ Never thought motorolo would give such a bad product battery drains super fast when g is on..mobile is getting heated up with even few mind of use..video recording gets stopped abruptly after 30 to 40 seas , this happened several times not always but the worst part is nothing gets stored even that 30 -40 seas of video when this problem occurs
 And again during this 30-40 seas the back of the phone and lens area are getting heated up so much terribly disappointed with this phone
 I am going to get it replaced after testing for few more days and if the problems persists..Hope i will get a better one at least without heating problem..don't buy this low quality product..I could not return it because i bought it on billion day sale..I believe moto is under pressure due to competition and ended up with this low quality product..moto g 1 st gen was so good and this is an insult calling an upgrade to moto go QUESTION os FLIPKART: I noticed that the price label and bar code on the box was tore away !!!
 Why os Are you sending used products os Or you dont want us customers to know something about the product price/barcode, etc Overall Moto G gen 2 buying experience is very bad and I hope I will get a better replacement
 Please dont disappoint
 Updated 17 Act Flipkart gave me a replacement
 Not much heating like the previous one..Camera functions properly
 Overall improvements required os Motorolo should have increased the battery capacity while going for a bigger screen
 os Brightness on the screen is not that great os White color is looking totally plastic..moto g first gen black gave a premium look and feel moto go white looks like cheap local brand build os Motorolo could have prices it a little higher another 1000 Os or so and improved on the above areas Update 23 Act There is no heating problem in the new piece and battery also quite stable
 I think the two issues are interconnected and got resolved in a defect free piece that i got as replacement
 Increasing the rating to 4 stars
 Definitely you wont get a better phone at this price range.Could have given it 5 starts if plastic feel / look was not there and screen brightness could have been better with a higher battery capacity
 First gen moto g is now just Rs.9999/- WOW..WOW ..Worth more than 5 stars on the scale of five!!!

 Pain draw back in motor is Battery and it has very poor battery cup while using mobile data and its producing heat too while browsing

 The phone looks really good with a monolithic design on the front side and a slightly curved shape which gives it a class look
 The phone of course has Android Kitkat...front cam is very good..same canst be said of back camera....played heavy games like ASphalt 7 and did not notice any significant hanging.....overall a very good proposition at this price...

 wont buy this phone the list of problems is endless but the main ones will be 1 really awful touch you will get frustrated using it 2 Battery doesn charge quickly but drains faster 3 laws a lot To for for some higher end honest buying mid range phone is really a bad idea

 The only con about the products It uses the same battery as the old Moto Os Considering the bigger screen size an upgrade would have made this perfect
 Nevertheless great products

 First of all I would like to thank flipkart for delivering me the god piece without any issues..... Now bout the phone ...I would say its gud.....I m using it since 15 days without any issues... Its fast n m a casual user so my battery lasts almost a day...
 Os said by other buyers its true that battery drains out pretty faster for continuous browsing nearly 6 hours The looks are god , speakers r of god quality,primary camera is very god in day light The bones in this phone is go ram..it D be better with 2 GB....accessories are of poor quality... N yes u wont get any file manager or apes out of the box ... However it is I m impressed with the phone n u wont regret it either after all how much more can u except from a budget smartphone...well the things about low budget is different in case of Us zenfone and xiaomi... Buyers dont think twice before purchasing it just go for it os

 I purchased MOTO G and Men on the launch day
 The delivery was before time promised by Flipkart.
 Appreciate it
 MOTO G and gen is a good phone with a nice camera a fairly good processor and RAM.
 Doesn hang but too early to comment
 The battery could have been better
 Doesn last a full day
 But dont regret buying it
 Value for money

 I all First of all him not a smart phone pro so writing this review truly based on my one month usage
 General The phone looks good not elegant
 Grip is nice thanks to rubberised back
 All quality exceptionally good can hear every single sound
 Touch is okay however faced little issues sometimes
 Rose Display is vivid colourful good reproduction of natural colour
 Auto brightness works perfectly and no need for manual brightness adjustment
 To performance lag so far
 I ran some heavy games Iron Man3, Shalt os for at least 30 mind
 To issue except little heating and battery drainage
 Good multitasking capability thanks to Qualcomm.
 Front dual speaker gives good sound quality comparable to blue tooth speakers
 LED notification.
 Good camera quality
 Sons The home back buttons are built in touch screen
 Takes away workplace except gaming and watching video
 Accessories quality are one of the poorest have seen
 these came in white colour however my ordered model was black
 Charger is only 550mA, takes hours for charging
 I doubt this headphone has output of 50dB.
 Want hear a movie while in busy train public unless you switch to extreme treble
 It gives ache in ears as you need to (hard)press fit into ears
 Battery is only 2070 os

 I have used Moto G first generation mobile also and in comparison to that I am loving this and Men
 I strongly believe its worth for the money

 Had this for a few days now
 First thoughts - him upbraiding from a Galaxy S the original one which had a 800x480 os AMOLED screen - so the 720p screen looks fabulous & pictures look great
 - I have the battery save on and I dont use bluetooth, so him getting almost 2 days of use out of it between 2 his usage every day between phone book reader music and will bit of browsing
 him sure Video will drain it faster
 - Sterno speakers are awesome; very clear and loud enough for my tastes at 60% volume setting
 - Moto migrate works much better in this version than in the previous one
 All my call history SMS etc got transferred without a problems
 Note that still also transfer all the music & photos/videos you have on the older phone so be prepared for a long transfer time (9GB of stuff took about 2 hrs).
 Of you have access to a desktop and recommend transferring out the media files with a data cable and meeting from the old phone before you do the migrate
 still be much faster
 - In call volume is excellent and sound is clearer
 I think the noise cancellation things seems to work well but that just a subjective opinion for now
 For what it costs I think this is an excellent phone
 Caveat: By son has the first gen Moto G and it slipped from the bed & fell about 2 feet
 The glass was fine but the LCD splintered and eventually stopped displaying properly
 Replacing the LCD at the official service center cost Os - quite expensive considering the price of the phone
 By Galaxy S on the other hand has fallen nearly a dozen times sometimes from os high
 The case has so many debts it looks like a car tender but the LCD works just fine
 Something to keep in mind if you have butter fingers

 I purchased this product on the controversial Fig Million May sale
 Exchanged an old phone for a reasonable prices
 The product was delivered on time as promised and the delivery person tool the old phone along with him
 He did examine the old phone thoroughly for any damages and verified the IMEI before handing over the new phone
 Coming to the produced I am very satisfied with the produced
 It is a very good phone for its prices
 It is really smooth and fast and the best inclusion in this and Men version over the st Men one is the expandable memory option
 The only thing missing is the data cable which we need to purchase separately

 Received my Moto G on the st of October and while I was concerned after reading a couple of reviews about receiving faulty pieces I seem to have got a good solid phone
 Was initially unhappy about the changes to the Moto G with the bigger screen and no increase in battery and I would have bought the old one if it was still in stock
 But thankful Motorola knew what they were doing
 The 5 inch screen increases the illusion of a premium phone and the battery suits my personal needs which can be moderate to heavy ( I do not play game on my phone
 Stock andros looks gorgeous on this screen and with guaranteed prompt updated I really canst see the need to upgrade my phone for a good couple of years
 I have a roommate who got the phone 6 and personally the only thing I envy about his phone is the superb battery life
 The phone does take close to 4 hours to go from 0-100% battery so that is a had annoying
 The moto charger also heat up and so have been using my samson charger for overnight charges because him paranoid).
 The phone gets warm with heavy use but its nothing alarming
 Recent covers for the phone are hard to come by and him still using it with no protective cover
 I haven dropped it so I canst really speak to how it candles bump and drops
 The camera is not as good as my Desire 500 camera in terms of use and getting shots in focus
 I had to download a third party camera pp to help with that
 Maybe I want using the built in version right but I often found it really tough to get decent snap
 To far him really really happy
 and easily recommend this phone to anyone
 I know the price segment is competitive and people have their references for what they want in a phone
 But this is a terrific phone that has no business costing this little
 Will update in a few months

 They will place another order for me and It would take 5 more days
 Now pathetic it is
 Finally i got the phone after 10 days from my order date
 TIPS: if u see cracking is not dating for days please do a call back request to check the order status By first order had some offers associated with this products
 but when os placed my order for and time I didn get any of them
 #UNHAPPYWITHFK Products awesome in one words
 installed many apes (truecaller,saavn,file manager best bank apply viber,skype) and works fine
 games are running cool os sufer/street slater candy crush/sudoku/flowfree).

 Reviewing after three days
 The Moto G and Men in Chinese White is a eye candy
 A strong and sturdy look is what you feel first after handling Moto G 2. The best thing about Moto G 2 is the camera 8MP primary and 2MP secondary camera and to the surprise the secondary is quite exceptional given its specification
 Primary is worth the prices
 The sound is good with dual-front speakers audit would not be the problems
 But when you hear it from the earphones the differentiation starts
 Other thinks as screen and body are good
 Price is a bit high its a perfect Rs.10000/- piece but no problem it has Google stamp which can be banker on

 I completely satisfied with motor for innovation adopted in UI,camera quality and many more features.The mobile itself so grabs captivated in terms of looks sleek and slim design
 The modification that has done to go compared go are quite appreciative interest of expandable memory slot though its more than sufficient for pp lovers
 MOTO Os modified are done in each and every aspects to taste of indian market
 Resulting its leading factor as a winner in phase best budget smartphone with high robotic quality
 By rating to MOTO Os is 4.5/5 Rose Stylish and sleek design
 Camera quality
 Capacitative UI.
 West graphics features for gaming lovers Sons Now quality backcover.
 Battery is bit disappoint
 Verdict Must grab the best smartphone in the present running mobile market trend

 Were are the first impressions - 1. Screen Vice crisp and vivid but only 720p.
 With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p.
 It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and unable in single hand
 2. Performance Android 4.4.4
 comes pre-installed.
 Lag-free so far
 Guns Riptide os pretty well
 Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400.
 os Officer Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine
 3. Round The front dual speakers are awesome.
 Very nice sound
 One of the other Boots (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity
 4. Camera 8 os main cam & 2 os front
 Very good snap so far both indoors and outdoor
 Not only 20 mind to experiment os 5.
 All quality 2 miss with noise cancellation and a loud speaker
 Feels good
 6. Micro os Clot His is the greatest inclusion
 Moto G sorely missed that
 Good option

 Moto has done a very good job removed all the drawback which were there in Moto Os
 One can go for this product blandly
 A very good performance by 8 os Camera slow motion recording is a good option
 Even the front camera is good
 Built quality is good
 Battery is ok gives you a day back with a few click + game + video + 3G.
 Overall a thumbs to Moto G 2.

 His is my th Moto from flipkart and I must say all in all I am very satisfied with both Moto G and Moto Os However the and generation Moto G is a class apart
 Google and Motorola combination is doing wonders to Well phone market
 I will not go into details of specs....
 Of you have a budget of less than 15K for a touchscreen andros phone than you canst get any better phone than this

 I have ordered 3 nos of moto g and generation and by mistaken all the 3 as black instead of 2 as black and 1 as white Os have received 2 nos and 1 yet to receive and asked flipkart to change the color instead black to white since the rd one is under processing they refused to change the color and very poor response from customer care.They said the policy wont allow to change the color Very pathetic experience
 they are not flexible nowadays and started cheating the customers

 First of all I would like to thank delivery staff and customer service staff for delivering me the mobile on time i requested them to deliver as early as possible through telephone conversation
 Coming to the Moto G2... Looks Sooooper...(Really i love it so simple and thinner
 the design is such a way that the mobile fits to your hand
 Size K Camera Its really a good buy under 13K for an 8MP camera
 the images are really good and i checked in the low light mode to check the flash and i found that the images are really good Internal Memory 16Gb more enough for me and it also can be expandable) Battery I do surf internet on the mobile mostly but the battery isn that good It drains within 5-6 his of continuous use of net and it also takes 2-3 his for full charging
 Speed the mobile runs very smoothly and I love it And the final words are It Simply Superb under 13K Any one interested to buy under 15K its a best buy

 The new Moto G (Gen2) is good but please do not try to upgrade to the latest code that the mobile requests now and then
 Once you download the software update the mobile will act wildly and doesn show up the menu and if you try to switch off the mobile will not switch on Moto have to do something with this

 Not the moto g within a day of ordering and the first impression is definitely great .

 Met this phone two days before West phone in this price range here are some problems and solutions os slow charging - it takes 3.15 hours on my first charge when 10% battery remaining then second time with same 10% remaining battery I charged with my Samsung 1.0mah charger this time it gets full charged in 2.10 hours
 To get good charger.. NOTE--BOTH THE TIME I NEVER USED os PHONE heating problem : I am a heavy user and game I never noticed any heating problem on gaming but while continuously playing dead trigger for an hour I found a little heat but it is not over heat and if u face any major heat problem the solution is turn or g network to g and start our phone that will release some ram and make or phone normal but it continues contact service center battery backup: as I say i am an heavy user and game it gives me 6 to 7 hours of battery back with 3 hours of gaming 2 his of video watching and mixed use of browsing webster social network listening music phone calls messages and snapping photo
 But in normal usage him sure it gives me 13 to 14 his of battery backup.
 NOTE :-The update of andros L makes this device to get more powerful battery life so just blandly go for it

 That i felt about the device.... Round gets distorted at high volumes
 its like a sort of vibration that is caused(in speaker trills that feels annoying while listening to musical full volume
 The dual speakers perform well at low volume(without any distortion but its not so loud(even at full volume
 -Charger provided is a 550mA charger that wont be able to charge the device faster
 It heat up like anything Display seems to be good and you wont be able to differentiate individual pipes by just looking at it normally
 To us data cable
 The charger provided does not come with detachable us cable The headsets provided are decent
 Shipping and delivery was fast and no trouble with that

 I got a faulty Motor and Men set delivered from flipkart...
 The device was getting heated up within 10 mind of usage
 I placed the order for replacement on and Act and also asked for the change of address as I had gifted the Mobile to my friend
 Even after confirming the Request os for Replacement and Change of Address , the replacement Product is not delivered till now In checking the status today they confirmed that the change of Address was not reflected in their Logistics department and they were trying replacement at old address for past 6 days Everyday for past 6 days they are just re-attempting to deliver at old address and re-scheduling the same saying customer has asked for re-schedule, where as I have never asked for same
 They dont have a simple common sense to call up the customer and find out why the Product is getting re-scheduled everyday for past 6 days Also being a Flipkart first customer , they are not able to keep up the service agreements
 A very bad experience with FLipkart delivery

 His is my first smartphone and him fully satisfied with it
 To lag whatsoever
 Brilliant display
 Sterno speakers
 Battery life is just fine but came to know that it gets better after some charge cycles.Also, Android L promises some even better battery saving techniques(mind you battery life depends a lot on the software part as well not merely the hardware
 And finally since it is a Motorola phone it is made to last(built quality excellent

 Ought Moto G (2013) back in March for my younger brother
 The quality as everyone knows lawless in that price point
 Considering the same trust i bought Moto G (2014) White
 The build it held was very cheap and in the night I could see the whole top been when the LED used to blink
 It was unacceptable
 Furthermore the icons were pixelated in 5'' screen
 They must have reduced the size of the icons
 Though the screen maintained the sharpness but not for so long
 The battery was disappointing took
 Had to return it with heavy heart as Motorola was my favourite brand and it produced such inferior device
 After a long conversation the Flipkart guns moulded their policies and accepted the return
 Had it been black version I might have given it a thought of keeping it
 Unexpected call drops and the callers voice could be heard in a 13*13 room no matter you get the volume low to the lowest point
 Enough said
 Eye Eye Moto G 2014

 Writing this review after using the phone on the st day.First of all i got the mobile on th of oct.First of all am the first user of andros phone.So,i would like to tell you that this phone is a good phone was searching for a good phone from last 4 months and this is the best but it has some consul Its mentioned that it has 16gb built but it only has 12gb in it
 It gets hanged when i am dating the system software otherwise till now,its running great camera quality is just awsome.If you guns are looking for a such camera quality then you should go for it however the standard quality is imp but you can shoot multiple pictures by just keeping your finger on the screen and also you can shoot slow video too..NO laws till now and no hangs.front
 camera is too slow but you can manage it..It has os screen.It has some other qualities too.you
 dont have to put it in silent mode every time.just
 adjust the time and it will get silent on your own..Overall,its a get phone at a ask prices

 There was a 120MB update as soon as I set up the device and now Google Now has been installed
 Perfect Sure Android, with guaranteed update to Android Os By only concern is the battery life as it has dropped 10% in 45 minutes maybe due to continuous download of apes and update through WiFi.

 Shone gets heated up for no reasons and phone gets hanged up thereafter
 Flipkart teach people informed me that 42 to 44 degree is normal for this phone
 Of that is the case why it was not mentioned before
 Temperature rises to 62 degree within 10 min of continuous use
 I bought it replaced my current cell phone is better than the first one but problem still persist
 There are many such cases with many of my colleagues
 I would recommend not to buy this phone

 His is one of the best mid-level phone that you can buy in Indian
 UI is very smooth
 It has the tendency to lag while using too many apes i use Google now launched Nova does not seems to have that issue
 Camera is decent good enough for FB/Whatsapp).
 Battery life purely depends on your usage its big screen causes a large drain on the battery so if you are into playing high end games you might have to keep this plugged in very often
 Buy it for brilliant screen and pure andros experience

 I am using this phone since last week and this phone is great Video recording quality is superb and touch is very smooth
 this is light weight phone and easy to hold
 quand core processor works great
 but i am not happy with pre installed ringtones because sounds are very low
 I would recommend this to friends

 after all i got my products
 not happy with the courier service
 they kept item for 3 days at their hut mentioning that consigned was out of station
 even they didn bother to call me
 they were even hesitating to share address and contact not for some security reasons
 somehow i managed to get their address to get device myself
 suggestion for the FLIPKART to use their own courier service (EKART LOGISTIC) rather than third party courier services like ECOM EXPRESS or DELHIVERY.
 coming back to products
 i was surprised with the sterno front facing speakers
 really brilliant and crisp output of the speakers
 screen clarity is decent too not that crisp but good i would say
 device build quality is very excellent
 feels very sturdy with good grip
 you wont regret buying it
 you must go for this gathering buying other brand device
 i was so amazed with device that i placed another order for the same device overall very satisfied with the device but not with the courier service

 Well this phone is way better than any of the budget smartphones out there
 The display the camera almost everything is perfect
 Its good for casual gazing though i did find a little bit lag when i was playing Minion Rush dont know why Did the benchmarks, and its showing this phone has a fixed density of 320, which is awesome.
 Yes the only disadvantage is the battery and a little bit more ram would have been perfect
 the battery lasts about 15-18 his with medium to heavy usage
 Part from this just stop looking here and there go and grab it
 Its a steal

 It delivered the item within 2 days

 A very bad experience with Motorola.

 I ordered moto go through filpcart at 7 os saturday and got mobile by 2 os on sunday
 Estimated delivery time is days but I got mobile just for a day thanks filpcart.
 I charged completely on the date I got mobile and used internet to son my goose account and to download few application
 with Os internet the battery lasted for only 4-5 his
 I dont know its good or bad
 Next day without using internet I just used for playing games listening songs and others for maximum time the battery lasted for a day
 I would suggest buyers to go for it based on your requirements like i dont use internet much in phone so moto go can sustain for 1-2 days that good
 Sincere request to motorola to somewhat concentrate on battery
 He dont expect our phone to manage for more than days
 but with optical usage it should sustain for least days
 I edited this after using it for a weeks
 His phone is awesome, I played games continuously for an hours the battery drained only 5-8%.
 To heating problems simply good in all perceptive.
 I love the PDF reader features(Black on White to save battery and less impact on eye during night when all light switched off Leading View option fits perfectly the text to screen but not figures manageable).

 His review is more about Flipkart's delivery
 I ordered just 2 days before the Gandhi jayanti + Dusshera twin holidays on Act os 3. Understandably, Flipkart showed the standard delivery date as Act 7.
 But I was pleasantly surprised when they delivered on Act 3 - on Dusshera!
 A holiday for most except Flipkart's delivery guns
 Kudos!

Sameer Marathe
 I folks His is my first buy from flipkart, and I must say am very much satisfied with kind of service provided
 Not my order delivered within almost 24-30hrs.
 Also booking and delivery process was also so simple and pleasant
 Moto G and Men - Wont share product specification as its provided here already
 Color - Ought black color which is nice in looks as well as grip is better on holding if compared with white variant
 But again black doesn provide premium look than that of white
 Simple if you want people to notice your phone then go with white else black
 Took wise rating - White - 60% / Black - 40% Design - Classic looks nothing fancy rubber coated back panel provides great grip
 Limb good quality of volume and power buttons
 Volume - All volume is very clear and great you wont face any trouble while hearing even if you are in the public place
 Two front facing loud speakers are also good but doesn meets up to your expectations
 But still better than single speaker honest
 Display - Excellent
 Smooth functioning.
 Not a single fixed lost here and there
 Camera - Great out door/sunlight picture quality
 Right - Very good flash light and picture clarity is definitely better than older moto g or other brand phone like mocromax etc OS - Os soon as I connected my phone with wife it asked me if you want to upgrade OS and i did immediately
 Now OS is - Android v - 4.4.4
 | Vernal v - 3.4.42.g668a77b
 Battery Life - Shone should last very easily least 24 hours with normal use
 Also charging time is also pretty fast than my older andros devices
 Gros - Excellent Display Latest Android OS and upgradable Master experience Good Camera quality Classic looks And I agree with and copy/pest other reviews comments on Rose
 Sons - According to personal observations Charger heat allot if switch is on for more than couple of hours
 Speakers - I doubt they might break quality soon if i continuously listen music on maximum volume limit
 By phone got little heat up on my first charging at side of camera but faced this only once so am not sure if its phone problem/charger's problem or my placement of mobile was not correct while charging placed near by my lawton fan which blows hot air By first product here and first review am so very happy with this phone and service provided by flipkart.
 Looking forward for more and more shopping from this site Overall phone rating(Under this price range)(Hands on - 9/10.

 I , one thing donna tell you you will love this phone
 i have used all kind of phone till date but this phone is really amazing not getting into technical specification you can read it
 its been 20 days of using my own fact sheet * its really fast * call quality is above par * provided ear phone sucks , you have to buy quality one from other vendor , tried samson earphone worked great specially bass which i loved most
 * video recording is fully os camera is really cool and fast played virtual tennis 376 os game without any Lag so you can guess powerful processor battery
 life is ok okay depends since i have too many apes and email all running 24*7 so i need charging after 12 his for normal user it will go full day

 Ordered on with Rep by around 7PM and got it delivered by 10:30 os on with in normal fare
 Very Good delivery service by Flipkart.
 Leg
 specification you people get in the webster this review is of only my experience
 Very good mobile for this prices
 Using from past 8 days every thing seem fine like call quality no laws in multi-tasking, ok good camera for this prices but only only only only issue is Battttttttteryyyy.
 Lasts for hardly one day in normal usage Gets heat up like anything if u speak for more than 20-25min Surprisingly when you start shooting some photos or video hardly with in some five min it gets heatup.
 Before any one who wants to buy think twice i dont understand such a good mobile why still MOTO has not sorted out this issue

 Having used the phone for a months it was a great relief moving out of my Gumma phone
 When my old phone broke and i was looking for a replacement it came down to In or Moto G2.
 Getting an In is like winning a poker game
 In the other hand ordered Moto Os and got it the very next day
 Almost everything is good about this phone - That could improve is os RAM of 2G.
 Not much lag as of now but still occasionally you can feel it
 os Slightly better battery life and a detachable us charge
 os The lip cover is too prices for 1700.
 hats now the favorite business plan of these companies to make huge money on selling accessories.

Vaishnav S Raj
 first of all before starting the review let me first congratulate flipkart for their delivery speed got the product in just 1 day os now about the phone..i will say it is the best you can get in the price range ask to 15k..both in terms of specification and in terms of product quality... pros... the stylish build and user and user interface #5" display loud and good quality front loudspeakers amazing camera quality...and also a very good front cam which takes amazing series os lightning speed processor without any lag or hang os os RRAM external memory expandable unto 32GB even with 16GB internal bones pretty average or below par battery difficult to get accessories as the product is new to market but i am sure this will get resolved in a matter of weeks os poor quality headphones ...you better buy a separate headphone as this has very poor goodness and audit quality overall worth a buy for ask Os

 another phone (MOTO Os only which hangs just like that , even no pp is running
 An merge had , ratification bar hang and start after twitching off the screen
 Moto G made success stories that y i bought 2 moto go for my brothers n disappointed with both sets
 and company is not acting on it
 I am disappointed after putting 26k.
 i should have try 1 first os . .

{
nadeem shafi
 ill just point out the sons here 1.Speakers are not all that great at all,voice tears at loud or even at normal volume,sometimes.
 2.Graphics are pathetic for high end games 3.Camera quality not good at all
 4.Battery drains very fast
 so i would say it failed to impress the consumers,who had expected the new moto g to be great after the upgradation.
 i would suggest that if you are tight on budget then only go for it,otherwise try some other option

 First of all sorry for my bad english
 I should first thank Flipkart for delivering me the product real fast
 It was about to be delivered on with october but i got it yesterday itself word Oct).
 Talking about Moto G and Men I got 3 Manuals, a charger and a headset.
 The design was cool and the packing was great
 Solid packing
 I have charged the mobile for 8 hours without turning on the phone and I used wife bluetooth and I see that the battery is still going good
 only 50% drained in 9 hours
 By samson star gets drained within 4 hours itself
 Moto G and gen battery is great and the price is awesome either
 May bye to samson era and get back to Motorola era
 The 8 os camera is great than Samsung's 10 os camera
 Definitely worth buying

 I purchased this phone on with Kept and writing a review after almost 10 days
 To soon after undoing I did the first boot and it was pretty quick and the UI was smooth as it should be
 the camera is satisfactory him not disappointed with it either both the primary and the secondary
 Coming to the Battery Life him pretty much happy a whole day back which i liked on it with an average usage putting it in wife and texts surging n etc Am happy with the performance
 The Display is also good
 Nothing to comment on it
 its Line
 Sound...! oh yea its awesome...! The Headphone is good i would say you can use the sponge for that to make it comfortable on the ears and u get it for INR. 5. or 10 maximum...
 The Build Quality is pretty neat in every aspect the volume roar and the power key are awesome.
 The only place where i felt the moto or the goose could have given some freedom for the user..., That the apes in the menu can be customized.
 It is alphabetically arranged
 To me I feel holding in one hand is a bit tough
 may be just to me
 Os have been using the Bony Peri V for past 1 year and which later made some troubles
 I switched over to MotoG2 after a lot of research and online reviews and him pretty much happy with it
 The All quality the Display Battery Round Camera the Had More processor Hats what you expect from a phone at this price range
 To with 1 or 2 flaws according to me... ill Late it 4.5 out of 5...! Of you are looking out for a budget Smart Shone with all good features packed with..., His shouldn disappoint your needs

 Motorola G 2 gen is simply awesome.
 The phone looks very good
 Most pleasing feature is it is sleek and so good to hold
 Back cover gives you grip and confidence that it can slip from your hand
 Software (Android Kitkat) is excellent and no laws while using
 Camera is good and easy to use
 But seems more noise is captured
 (However, noise can be seen only when picture is loomed otherwise pictures are too good

 I have been using the phone for 2 weeks now & can complain on anything am very happy with battery backup.
 With my usage it last whole day plus left with enough charge to go for another 8-10 hours
 Which I never got from my previous phone Samsung Grand
 Rate work Motorola!!!
 Only one thing which i am missing in motor compared to Samsung Grand is multitasking option....I am sure Motorola would add these in their new phone therefore 4 stars...else it deserves os

 I had asked to replace with the new one as it comes under 30 days return policy

 I have always been afraid to buy expensive things online and this time I placed an order on this phone
 Interesting events followed
 I was delivered the product six days before the delivery date and I was really astounded despite of the string of festival holidays that occurred by the swiftness of the delivery
 In undoing the product i found that there was a manufacturing defect with the phone
 I politely contracted the customer care of flipkart and he was more than happy to replace the device.The replacement was done swiftly ( received the product even before the promised delivery date of the then defective products The replaced product is working well
 and Thanks to flipkart for helping me out by doing a very good customer support P.S: Us if you do receive a product that turns out to be defective please be patient and polite with the customer care
 They will surely help you out

 its now 15+ days since i have used moto go and below is what i found os the phone design is very attractive and stylish....definately will get compliments from your friends
 camera both front and rear are decent video are of high quality os after 3 days of purchase it hanged and loses its data conductivity constantly but after starting it was again normal one thing i hate a lot is the battery back of this phone it does even last for 7 hours at full usage..........i dont know why the smart people had reduced the battery after increasing the screen size..........the should have increased it
 apart from battery issue not a major issue find with this phone.......all the games work perfectly and 16 go internal memory is quiet good conclusion if u dont get annoyed by battery and are concerned with camera nd looks only then go for it otherwise for a battery phone go for gone

 Ordered and quick delivery from lip part in less than 2 days
 The lip cover is waiting for replacement as the top left of it does not fit well
 Coming to phone it is better phone at this price range
 The sons are as usual Battery
 Heating is a natural phenomenon with many of the phone and it was bearable
 To keep the cost of the phone unfordable the Charger, head phone are not of the quality make
 Motorola instead of supplying these happy ones should have given option to the customers to select the charge head phone and USB cable from their quality products with specifications,keeping the cost of the phone separately
 so that those who want to purchase the accessories can purchase from Motorola / other sources
 I am using Foka charger and Bony head phone which are excellent in their performance than the happy supplied with the box item
 His is the observation made by me after one day use

 I am a fan of Motorola product always and awaited for this Moto G and Men
 I am really frustrated when seeing the real products
 1.
 The size of the screen is not actually 5 inch
 But 0.25 inch is occupied for back and menu button so really it is 4.7 inch only
 Other branded mobile are having separate space for back button
 His is really not good
 2. The back panel is so lose and shaking while using 3.
 The camera is not having more option like white balance night mode and time etc which is really frustrating.
 I do not know what is the use of having 8 meg fixed camera
 4. The screen is not automatically rotating many times need to shake 5.
 Not able to use the menu pad after display is off while speaking
 6.
 Any time other party is not able to hear my voice while calling
 7. Low in processing speed though it is 1 os RAM 8. Took is also like os remote 9.
 There is no USB cable for this for connecting to computer
 I really worried about this product how a such branded company is releasing this kind of products

 It is a great value for money
 the competing phone are almost Os more than this
 Its 8Mega fixed camera is really good and all Images are very sharp
 also you will feel the phone is very light
 16GB built memory is added advantage
 You can use this phone as If Hotspot.
 Also you can use this Shone as USB mode through USB Tethering.
 His Shone is having excellent UI and Great battery
 Pros:1) Great value for Money
 os great call quality
 os Dual Speakers are amazing
 os 2 os front camera
 os Bigger Screen Gorilla Glass Sons os the Stock Head Shone is pretty Average but still good
 os Battery is Inbuilt, On removable
 And let me say Great service by Flipkart" .
 yes the first piece received by me has a defective 8 megapixel camera
 The Images were always out of focus
 I immediately made a return request on the same day
 The customer service guns called me next day
 i explained them regarding the faulty camera
 He politely accepted for Replacement
 I returned the phone to flipkart through same courier
 Today i got the new Piece
 The new piece is in perfect condition

 Round the Moto Os to be a great phone with a simple and easy user friendly interface
 The shape and weight makes it easy to handle with one hand
 I just wish the package provided a link to a downlaodable user guide

 It doesn feel like quand core processor phone
 By earlier phone Micromax Canvas Anus was better than this

 I am too cautious about choosing any electronic cadet as I dont like wasting money again and again on badges things and buy them only to meet my needs... One LOTS of research to select this one... Now have used it for about 10 days extensively
 I feel I need not to give technical specifications...
 To giving only my experiences with this phone Performance Very good Happy User Interface ( I preferably use NOVA launcher), To lags.. But I am not a gaming guy after installing 40+ apps... RAM still 220-320 B free
 can be increased if you disabled few preexisting apes Of you dont need them
 To heating problem...like described in Red I os reviews Camera Dear too good for day to day usage
 I need it for clinking notes newspaper cuttings and believe me ... pick are readable very very easily
 pick are great....
 Only thing I didn like is camera software as there is no option for increasing Photo Fixes we can shoot only att os but not 5 or 6 os to decrease size of pick and can shoot only os video not VGA resolution But again the problem is solved by rd party apes like camera 360 .
 Front camera dont need actually but found it to be more than good for video calls... Display Awesome for the price... but I know there are better 1080 p display bones if you can spend more... Build Quality.. very sturdy solid nice design...gives premium look and feel... Battery Only department that didn make me elated
 Though the battery back is not very bad and it was not expected to be great either as 2000 oh can not be a very good support for 5 inch screen... with moderate use easily passes 12+ hours but intensive internet usage with on screen work can drain it in 8-9 hours completely...
 But still happy...
 Not much disappointing... CALL QUALITY- SUPERB is the word.... best call volume among all bones I have used till date.... can hear someone on call with hands-free OFF and holding the one 1-2 inch away from your ear when volume is set to the maximum Speakers very Vice double front firing speakers is a welcome change here... watching movie is a real fun with sound coming from near the screen instead of back in most of the phone including previous Moto G).. Overall....
 More than a Vice phone at a very reasonable price... if you can spend 13K bucks I would suggest this is better than bands one is doubtful of...(i wont name but feel most of you people can guess here).. can To for this phone with eyes closed....
 And not to forget.... Flipkart delivery as usual has been praiseworthy Not my one on and day after ordering...

 When i decide to change my Samsung S dust paper weight i call it sometime's), i had only 2 mobile in my mind 1. Moto G 2. Apple phone Os I didn want to buy Samsung, Xiaomi or Us products
 I was really impressed when Moto G 2 was announced looking at the new add on features to existing Moto Os
 I would recommend you to buy this product simply because it is awesome and lawless
 His phone is listed for Android L 5.0 upgrade which is really appreciable and stands high among its rivals Xiaomi and Asus.
 Overall a good budget phone under a price bracket of 15K :))))
