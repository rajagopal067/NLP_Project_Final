 I bought this phone in February with a lot of hopes and positive vices as it was in the bestseller list back then dont know if its in there anymore
 It came with andros kit-kat and it worked just perfectly
 DISAPPOINTMENTS : .
 I updated it to andros lollipop back in april
 The experience has been extremely disappointing after that
 The phone hangs a lot stops responding behaves in a weird manner touch screen laws and just forget about high end gaming experience as it does not even support the basic games properly now
 Talking about the battery life it does not even last a day so if you are planning to place an order then add a power bank in your cart too(its a must which means another 2000 bucks .
 Memory 1 os of ram is simply not enough for a lollipop updated I dont know any technicalities but it just does not feel enough .
 I wanted a phone which candles multi-tasking well but it simply does not(same problems hangs a lot
 I have seen cheaper phone with the same configuration performing so well than this .
 Heating issues(sometimes). .
 Speakers stop working after 10 minutes of music playback(headphones/earphones work just fine .
 Camera focus it just does not work
 Very time I land up with an focused image
 hats it
 To more disappointments
 os shop safe Os

 I purchased this phone succumbing to the reviews it naked in but I fell into the unfortunate customer list those bound to get a defective piece of a fast selling machine
 The phone once got into sleep mode for long duration never activate the display on clinking the power button
 It then requires a restarted
 I thought Andriod 5.0.2 is the culprit but turned out its not
 The service center in Foci is so pathetic that for everything they will ask to replace motherboard, which I did
 But the problem is still persisting
 I have excavated this and waiting to hear from the manufacturers

 Mobile is not repaired since 25days, i have given my mobile to B2X service center on th september 2015 for charging related issue,they said collect your mobile on coming weekend (11th sept 2015) , but since then they are giving the reason that they dont have parts available right now have registered many complaints with motorola service center they are also doing false promise they just used to give coming weekend date and the status will remain same , after so many excavation also they are not gathered about customers
 need to register a case against motorola and B2X, its mental torture for me
 complaint number is Reference #150907-009508

 amazing product to buy but many not any more if you satisfy with 1GB RAM then it is a good option for you which saves or some bucks but if you need your phone wid loads of apes to store then you must prefer MOTO GEN3 and the best thing about is that the cost is also not more than MOTO Os

 The phone worked perfectly fine for 3 months
 However the phone apiece stopped working after that
 Surprisingly we are able to hear the callers voice while calling through Skype, but regular calls are marred with no sound issue
 Cried searching for a solution and got to know that a lot of other people too are facing similar issues with this phone
 Haven't been able to find a solution yet
 Seems like an andros software issue
 Planning to visit service center to get it working again

 I had purchased Moto Os for my father
 Unfortunately its display stopped working after couple of weeks of purchasing it so I took it to local authorized service center of Motorola.
 They took my phone issued me job sheet and told me that they do not have required spare part in their stock so it will take around 10-12 days time in getting it repaired
 I sent an email to Motorola same day requesting them to send required spare part to service center so my phone can be repaired sooner
 I received an acknowledgment from them they the matter has been excavated to higher authorities
 Either service center received required part nor did I receive any reply from Motorola after that
 I again sent two reminders to Motorola by email but all vain
 It was September 10, 2015 when my phone was taken by service center and now it is September 25, 2015 but my phone is not fixed due to availability of required spare part and I do not see any sign of spare part coming
 It is so negligence and ignorance of Motorola.
 I am surprised to see so worst level of customer service of Motorola.
 Details of service center are as below Service note job # AMSAGR000252 GIN # GINAGR000261 ELS date & time September 10, 2015 6:07:25 os Will Motorola officials pay attention on this or I made one of the biggest mistake of my life in purchasing Motorola device
 Thank you

 I have used Moto e Moto g and Moto g(2nd).
 performance and quality of all these phone was very good
 To based on this good experience i decide to buy same phone moto go (2nd) for my wife but this time i disappointed very much from its display and camera quality
 Although Motorolla has reduced it price as compare to last year but its quality reduction is more than its prices
 1.
 Its display looks purple during standby mode
 same can be easily differentiated
 It feels like low cost chinese phone
 2. A very thin wire mesh is present on screen when see from side of display 3. Touch is missing some time
 4. Camera quality is also degraded
 5.
 One of SIM holder not working properly and hold the SIM in four-five tries
 It happens every time
 I have both phone Soto go and genu purchased last year and second phone purchased last weeks
 To above point are based on actual comparison between them

 I have ordered Motorola grand genu on June 11 2015.I got the delivery by 16th.On th July I placed an replacement request as there was a blue spot on the screen went to the service center they told its donna take least 20-30 days for repairing.Since not much days had passed so i got of asking for an replacement.once
 they rejected my request saying that it could be fixed by an SOFTWARE(how can a hardware problem be fixed by a software???).
 again i placed a request,then my request was confirmed.on
 with July 2015 i got the new phone.now
 on 21 September I am again facing problems.Now this time it is that my and him slot is not directing the him cards
 When i contracted the service center,they registered my complaint and told me that it will take 7 days to repair
 after 2 days i get a call saying that no parts are available so its donna take long to repair.I'm really disappointed by Motorola.

 Flipcart is promoting the product through false adverse
 Os returned in your website"The phone also features a water resistant coating which protects the phone from the inside out
 Take a call wherever you are even if there a bit of rain"... which is not at all mentioned in motorola's webster
 By phone (MotoG and Gen.) got damaged inside out co of water damage and now service centre guy at Motorola are not providing any replacement though it is in warranty period purchased on with June).
 To dear flipkart, have your os Kept
 have enough balls to provide me a replacement
 It least have you enough guns to accept the thing that YOU ARE PROMOTING THE PRODUCT FALSELY??

 It is a nice phone under 10k.
 But with few ve points
 I bought it 2 months back
 First piece had major problem with battery it needed to charge 2-3 times a day also it used to hang a lot
 I asked flipkart Motorola support to replace the phone the test for phone performance was good but their suggestions to improve performance were very funny
 They asked me to stop the apes that are using maximum RAM whenever I stop using those apes all the time
 Os this the way to improve phone performance
 Later on got replacement from flipkart.
 Second piece was working fine until I updated the phone
 After I updated the phone the camera quality became worst every image comes blurred
 Shone takes 3-4 hours to charge completely
 Now all need to factory rest the phone
 Otherwise the phone is oka
 I dont play any games but I do watch lots of video on it
 But I canst switch between multiple apes at a time otherwise it will hang
 Rose 1. Good camera quality 2. Vice touch screen 3. Video and Round quality is good Sons 1. Door battery drains faster 2. 1GB RAM against 16GB internal memory is not enough at all
 The phone hangs most of the time

 I bought this phone in april 2015.
 I preferred it over xiaomi because of the better overall experience
 But few days back I unintentionally inserted the micro us charger in the wrong direction idea upside down which somehow damaged the charging port on the phone
 I took it to service centre
 They asked for ₹ 7500 to replace the whole motherboard!
 I realise it was my mistake but I think ₹ 7500 is too much for a phone which costs ₹ 9000 now

 Ought this phone after having listened thread several reviews - as always implacable service in terms of delivery from Flipkarts end in serving their Priority Customers received the product in 1 day however upon a few days of use the product started to heat up significantly - perhaps the 1 os RAM want adept in coming with moderate multitasking.
 Requested for a refund but was met with a few disappointing customer service minion arguing their level of logic however some of the senior folks special mentions to Or Venkatesh/Mr.
 Shiva) were able to rescue the situation and help with my refund
 Thanks again Flipkart for restoring the consumers belief in what is soon becoming a dependable brand for Indian e-Commerce!

 I have been using this phone for almost a months
 The phone performance is pathetic
 To pro all cost
 I mean it has all the basic features which now a days any andros phone has but that is not what is expected from Motorola.
 Since day one the phone battery has been troubling me
 It takes at least 4 hours of continuous charging to get fully charged and even after charging fully battery hardly lasts for a day
 And all this happy performance for a user like me who doesn use phone for anything except internet surging and whatsapp.
 In top of it I tried to put a return request over three times but the response from Flipkart is pathetic and unexpected
 I was told by customer care executive that it is normal for any andros phone to take 4 hours to charge and battery back up of a day is normal took
 Customer care executive also advised me not to use third party applications as it consumed more battery
 Now that a six...I mean if you canst use os applications why would I buy a smart phone
 A total wastage of money dont go for it

 The video quality on the moto go was good.The new moto go feels really good to hold in hand and feels lighter.The camera is pretty good on the g2.Sound quality is pretty good on the moto go
 Also i like the way Flipkart ships the products os Delivery & support is very good os

 its been around some three months I have been using the phone the major sons are the battery back which is not so good(2070 mAh)it drains real fast and the phone seems to hang at times also the calls receiving isn good loud enough that the person sitting nearby you can hear the person on the other end of the phone although the hands free option isn selected I find the motor quite stylish though and the camera resolution gives really good images

 I have purchased MOTO G and Generation on with May 2015 but the hands giving so many problem in the span of 1-2 months
 Very poor quality of battery getting hot very earlier calling sound quality not good
 The major problem is with display it is continuously flakes when brightness kept at low level
 When I capture the images with rear camera the images that I capture are not clear they are blurred
 Video shooting is also blurred
 The biggest problem that I have faced that hands doesn support 16 os memory card however the hands supporting capacity is 32 os Very Funny).
 Anyway there are other minor problems that I wont describe here
 I want to return the Handset to the company because I am not satisfied with the Handset & the Company service when I am investing Os 11000/- in a very CHEAP HANDSET.
 Of any support & action is not taken against my review then I will approach to the CONSUMER COURT seeking reimbursement of Handset & other expenses regarding the problems

 The phone is pretty average
 Nothing great about it
 Given its price range this is what you could expect
 The sound quality degraded after few months
 The are only 2 service centers and the people are very less knowledgeable to fix such issues
 The battery life is poor
 Had to charge everyday for normal usage
 Of you switch on Mobile data for the whole day and turn on Whatsapp and email only the battery will go off even before the end of the day Honestly no heating issues etc
 Camera was os for me fit for purpose him not a great game buff so haven tested gaming apply

 I have purchased Motor Os in the last week of april this year(2015).
 The mobile is a value for money
 Display quality camera performance etc are good
 The mobile does not hang unlike Samsung, may be because the stock andros installed in motor
 The battery back up is just okay for 1 day for voice calls and 1 to 2 his of data usage
 But if video data and apes are used extensively power bank is a must
 The stock andros is a little user unfriendly but the performance of the software obviates that small disadvantage and one would get used to the tricks easily
 But as i said in the beginning the biggest plus point is that the mobile is value for the money (Rs.10K).
 He can throw it after one year and buy a new mobile with latest specie
 I had used samson for 2 years earlier that was bought at ask and the comparison is very simple and obvious for me

 I had used this product for more than 9 months found no issue in this products
 Really very good mobile it is Unfortunately i missed it in traffic and now i am reviewing this products
 Any one if thinking of getting this product please go without hesitation
 Some of guns think of Os and Os mobile but i feel now Os is better
 After purchasing Os mobile I have noticed that there is very fast Data consumption in 4G.
 However Os gives good speed but there is only difference of 19-20 in Os & Os and now i feel my Moto and gen was really better
 Any of have written battery back is low but the more battery back means you are keeping higher risk in your pocket
 In this product there is nothing like it last a whole working day and you can charge in night for next day
 Also Flipkart service is really very good

 I got this phone in sept 2014.
 so this review is after one year usage it runs like a charm pure stock andros experience n plenty of storage no bloatwares!
 camera performance is decent.back
 panel has good rubber grip cost plays happy 1080p video
 i updated this phone from mitka 4.4.4 to lollipop 5.0.2, and the whole experience has changed its now worst!!! 1)apps take time to open and some of them crash n re-open even after closing them.:(
 the default music player stops playing n closes in the middle when multitasking or sometimes wen minimized.com'on
 man really
 even default music play
 also my favourite multifeature music pp JETAUDIO clashes everytime when playing songs.!oh man !
 i didn have any of this problems on kitkat!
 i hope lollipop 5.1.0
 fixes this no official update is released
 bottomline: stick to the default OS was it is optimized for it
 update to newer version only wen it is fully tested stable and reviewed by others!!!! as and always me

 His set is totally a scrape
 It hangs frequent battery is not even lasting for 12 hours network gets disconnected frequently
 I trusted flipkart to but this products
 But when i complaint about product and ask to return they just given me troubleshooting step to format the phone just to pass 1 month replacement period
 I am not even able to use this phone for proper calling due to hang and network issue
 I will never trust flipkart in future now
 His will be my last buy from flipkart.
 It was never expected from a brand like flipkart.
 Door flipkart, poor motor
 I just hate this product and now also flipkart.
 I could have gone for negative rating if it was there

 When gone to service centre told that they will look into this
 After that got a call that it is damaged and for repair 1100/- else pay 175/- as investigation charges
 Shone purchased in March 2015 and still under warranty
 Now one can damage inside the him sloth
 It is like taking money by cheating customers
 os one should buy motorola phone

 Have been using this phone for almost a year and has been a gem of a phone for the price provided
 Its probably one of the best dual him phone available on the market
 Considering this has a stock Android installed there have been no issues related to the phone hanging despite having multiple applications open in the background
 Started seeing a bit of lag after upbraiding the OS to Lollipop 5.0.
 Os most of you might already be aware the memory leak issue has been a major drag on the resources of the phone
 Desperately awaiting the Lollipop 5.1 upgrade to fix the dark issue
 The battery back has been decent
 It lasts for a day on standard usage including being on the safi for the whole day
 The battery save mode on the Lollipop OS is another boon in case you intend to travel for an extended period
 Overall a really great buy

 Back of bloatware, stock UI and able processor makes this a great buy

 I bought this mobile(moto go from flipkart couple of months back
 Pain issues facing till date are during call the person on opposite side can hear my voice but I can hear him this problem is since i have bought the phone
 More over called is getting echo voice when ever he speaks
 Also there is an issue with network connectivity.
 Initially i used Hittel him when ever call is dropped network signal also gets dropped
 Os thought its an Hittel issue
 Later moved to vodafone on mobile portability.
 Same issue again
 I used to get more calls every day every one complaints about these issues
 I suggest dont ever buy any motorola mobile

Sudha Nookala
 I was never a person who would buy any thing online prefer going to the store to pick the stuff I wish to buy
 Os my friend suggested me to try buying product @ Flipkart I had decided to buy Soto G and Generation)".
 His is the worst phone does not catch signals nor wife
 I feel I have a dummy phone in hand where I can make calls nor check internet despite having Os mobile data
 The issue has got nothing to do with the mobile service provider as I have a Samsung phone and another number which works perfectly fine
 Os I am new to online shopping never realized I could return the products
 Never thought Flipkart products are this bad
 His is my first and last buy from Flipkart.

 Motorola has got the worst warranty agreement
 I bought a MOTO Os 3 months ago...it developed charging problems and with time got very severe
 It totally stopped charging about 10 days ago.The service center guns told me that charging port comes under physical damage and is hence not covered under warranty
 but if the charging port is intact how can there be an external physical damage..on top of that they dont have their own service centers..you'll have to stand in line for hours before you finally get your chance
 The customer care and service center people are rude and insensitive.I've used Samsung, Foka in the past and i never faced any such issues before...Motorola is during people with such frivolous warranty arrangements...their charging port is of inferior quality and they dont even want to cover it under their warranty.If a device is developing problems under normal usage then they should be able to cover it under their warranty..They can advertise all they want on TV..but you can only know about the quality of a brandy when you approach their service center...and for me Motorola is among the worst in India...was planning to go for Os but will never ever buy a moto and not recommend others to buy it

 The phone is defective and the display is not working
 I had requested for the replacement
 but I got the call from the flipkart technical team and i can listen their voice clearly
 But they are saying that they can listen my voice so disconcerting the call and sending a message that they will call tomorrow
 it was happening from last 2 days
 It looks like they are making a drama and try to forcing me to use a defective products
 It is very very bad from Flipkart.

 Have you used this products
 its always better to review a product you have personally experienced
 Educate your readers Provide a relevant unbiased overview of the products
 Leaders are interested in the pro and the sons of the products
 He yourself be information Met your personality shine through but its equally important to provide facts to back up your opinion
 Met your facts right

 Moto have made a great revolution in smartphone market with high feature phone in reasonable prices the same goes to moto Os its a complete package with great features and the most amazing thing it comes in lollipop 5.1.1 which i guess every wants now a day but i am little disappointed with 2 things one is the ram which should have been increased till 2GB and the other thing is that moto doesn provide any detachable cable with the charger so to transfer the data from the os we need to buy another cable
 But overall its a great phone to buy in just 10K.

 I bought this mobile three months back when the cost was 13000 which doesn meet my expectations performance wise

 Overall it is okay with present cost

 I bought this phone it will never have any issue like Moto G-1st Men but I was wrong and paying for my mistakes Os have been using this Moto G since last 4-5 months and for following issues I called customer care several times in vain
 When I excavated to Motorola India os via Twitter , unexpectedly nobody cares
 os Gyroscope not working properly to support os ( Cardboard ) – Even tested on Moto G rd Men , so dont prefer that as well
 os You will never get updated for Android ( still on 5.0.1 ) not even 5.1 os him not enthusiast of games , but RAM performance is poor even in Moto G word Men os Customer care disconnected call in between discussion to sort out the problem os Customer care waiting time at least 5 mind
 Motorola doesn deserve rating 1 however there is no any other option for below rating

{
Afnaan Khan
 its been around a month and a half since I purchased this phone,and here is my read on it 1.
 The front and rear camera are really good
 2. Battery is decent,although it drains faster when data is on,compared to WiFi. 3. Must to put it through the grinder installed a ton of applications in the starting and used them all at once and the background apes did NOT serve to be a problems
 4. Charging time is a little on the higher side
 Overall and give this an 8/10.

 I I think my review on this product does not matters a lot now as rd generation is for sale
 But still for those who still want to invest in and generation awesome product specially in current rate
 it hangs some times now after 6 or 7 months usage of my phone
 because i use it very hard and hard
 my other Friends who are using same phone they are saying their phone is working well
 about warranty status
 they takes time but still they do the work well
 but for sure i want to let you know mid and speakers are attached with motherboard for those who are not good for technical knowledge once your warranty is over you have to change the board inside the phone even if your mid stops working or your speaker stops working

 Everything seems to be best for the money you paid but touch screen has some issue and I have given for repair after four months of purchase ...
 You will find many reference for touch issue if you search in google.... Moto should look in to this in next release... 1. battery should have been bit higher capacity or efficient battery save would have been enhanced this phone further...

 Heedless to say it is a good phone
 But the camera quality is not good having an 8 os camera the pick you take are full of noise no details & apes take a hell lot of RAM space
 Major drawback at least for me is it doesn support SIM contact you have to import them in phone was like in phone & windows I guess it is because of Android 5.0 updated
 Motorola should provide Android 5.1 update to it

 Incredible phone & nice service by Flipkart now just one line close your eyes & buy Moto Os without second thought

 I am disappointed with this phone
 I have been using moto g since its first gen release date and was happy with the performance of the first genu
 But when I moved to the and gen by exchange offer I felt created
 I have ordered a total of 5 moto g for my family and friends from my account within last 2 months and all of them are unhappy with the performance
 Desperately waiting for an Android Lollipop 5.1 updated with a hope that the issued would be solved
 Wont take a risk to order this phone

vikram raju re...
 I had ordered Moto Os on with June 2015 by exchanging Moto G1.
 Problem started from and week onwards extreme heating and restarting).
 I had requested Flipkart for a replacement and they have called back to perform remote diagnostic tests and concluded saying the mobile is proper and they canceled my replacement request
 The heating problem started and again requested and they rejected by saying lame things
 Third time also same thing happened and I stopped calling Flipkart people because I got passed off
 I said to Flipkart customer care every time please replace this mobile within one month as per the replacement policy otherwise if I call and month you will say replacement policy is period has crossed
 Same thing happened now today my mobile got heated up and all the data is lost
 I called Flipkart and said the same things and as anticipated they replied what I had expected
 They said as per flipkart replacement policy we canst give you any replacement or refund because this is and months
 After this I have called Motorola customer care explained the problems they told that I can get refund because I have raised complaint within one month as per Flipkart replacement policy
 His Flipkart people are not accepting my request which is ethical by giving faulty mobile to me and gaming me until the first month is over and now denying replacing the phone because it is the second months
 Any way I will not keep quite till they will refund money or replace my fault Moto and G mobile
 I am registering complaint in consumer court
 I will flood this cheating news all over the Internet so that other consumers are aware of this tactic when they get a faulty products

 Never expected this from Motorola.
 The device is not able to handle basic operations properly some of the bags are 1. Contact list gets deleted(when contracted with Motorola Customer Are - they said it is not repairable, format your device and take backup.
 Even after forgetting the problem still persists
 In pressing the issue Flipkart replaced the device but the problem is still there in the second device
 2. Any a times while receiving an oncoming call neither the screen-light turns on nor the screen-lock gets unlocked one can only hear the ringtone.
 3.
 Even when you delete an event in the callender it appears until on starts the device

 I ordered the phone on 12-Aug-2015 and it was delivered on 18-Aug-2015.
 The phone display has some problems the brightness level is much below the standards of regular MotoG2 handset.
 Also there is yellow tint in the display
 I requested for a replacement Flipkart technical called me and asked to install a SmartCheck application
 With this application they did few display tests and did not find a problems
 Now can someone test the phone display remote and conclude there are no problems
 The display brightness is extremely low at minimum level it is almost invisible
 Extremely Disappointed with Flipkart return policy will think twice before I use next Flipkart service
 Of you are one among those who get a defective item through Flipkart you are unlucky strictly avoid electronic items thorough Flipkart.

Dhinagar K D
 In my past 5 months of experience with Moto G os i was satisfied with the performance of the mobile and its processing speed
 But one thing that was not fine in my last 5 months of usage was the battery
 From the very first day it takes nearly 3 to his to get fully charged
 It was very bad when compared to other mobile of this range because other mobile getting fully changed by the or within 2hrs.
 But i am worried that i got some defective piece since other Moto G and generation users dont face this issue while changing the mobile
 Also the battery was draining lastly when we play online games ratio was like if you play 10 mind in online then 10 to 15 % charge will be lost
 But if you not using internet the battery serves nicely for 2 days
 But when using net and that too online games its draining very much faster

 In contracting motorola regarding warranty I was told display is not covered in warranty and it would cost me approve 6000 os to get it fixed
 And now him regretting not buying a phone with gorilla glass
 By suggestion skin this phone for a one with gorilla glass or get an insurance

 1.
 From second month I am facing network issues I got service done once again the network problem started in 20 days 2. There is no proper service center they have hired some third party office to service motorola mobiles).
 These third party service centers lack time maintenance proper infrastructure always faces network issues
 3. When I went to get the service done found that many people are facing the similar issues

 ##This one star rating is not for the products I am sitting overseas and I ordered a Moto G for my parents back in Indian
 Flipkart proudly announced its delivery well in advanced but doesn it care about the authenticity about the recipient took
 The delivery boys care even less
 They do not even ask for the identity of the recipients
 When I traced my shipment which was directed to an educational institutions I find the order status as delivered & that the recipient has signed my days name which is not true
 By dad was not even there at that time & someone impersonate him & the agents just need a signature in their delivery sheets column
 Now I dont know who has the shipments
 He are frantically searching for it
 Flipkart please take note of this & dont think your job is done once you have shipped the item from your warehouse
 It is YOUR responsibility to see it through
 Otherwise there will be a shower of 1/5 star rating and such reviews from disappointed consumers like myself

 With utmost displeasure i would like to state that I am extremely unhappy with the service being provided for Motorola honest
 I bought a moto G and generation phone on with April 2015 and exactly 4 months later my mobile phone is not in working condition anymore
 It has just become a toy a toy of worth Os 12000/-.
 Although the mobile is within the warranty period I have been told by the Motorola customer care that they wont be able to repair the same as the main board has been damaged and falls under liquid damage category
 But the truth is that I kept my phone always in a safe place and it was never kept in any kind of compromising position
 By questions and concerns regarding Motorola phone services are very serious as Os 12000/- is not a joke
 Everybody works hard for every single penny they earn
 By phone was not exposed to any kind of liquid and it turns out to be really annoying when I hear that my phone will not fall under warranty
 I am sick and tired of this warranty policy terms and conditions la la law
 I am a Ph.D scholar in Jadavpur University and one thing is for sure that I wont suggest the Motorola phone to anybody in future
 Another thing is that we buy phone depending on reviews of the mobile phone out here and find that one out of many has complaints or has given a low rating but the fact is that u will face the problem once you have bought the phone because it has got the worst service of all Thanking You Hours Sincerely Sukalpa Choudhury

 Have to start the phone using long press after which all the pp start and all the data is lost especially WhatsApp data

 i can say a good smart phone for your daily need basis
 but it hangs a lot on dual him usage dual account settings and on gaming that very simple game like Brandy crush Saga).
 Overall it s a good deal

 Have been using since 8 days first two days it was good where During Through Wi-Fi.
 Mobile took 3 hours to charge fully while surging on Mobile Data plan it was really pathetic performance... battery is draining like if you surf for 2 hours continuously you need to put charging for 3 more hours
 Except battery everything is very Good... Worst battery performance... Totally dissatisfied

 I got my moto g and gen on 10th- july-2015 I am experiencing strange issues , Sometimes When someone calls me i am unable to hear anything for callers side , twitching from apiece to speakers also gives no sound
 It happens quite often , but random , and once it happens , even if I make a call i am unable to hear anything
 Starting the phone fixes the issue , but after sometime it comes back automatically and is very annoying
 Dusted wanted to know if other moto Os users also have the same issue or is it just me , with a defective hands .

 There are other option but with Moto G you will have no problems as it is strong fast with a good battery
 Hardware Very strong build I dropped this a dozen times already and not a scratch on this
 Very thing works
 Performance Very Last To lag even after installing 40 to 50 apply
 Of you are into games the like of Shalt 8 run super fast
 The phone doesn heat up
 Camera Both camera are nice though the LED flash is an LED flash wont light up the whole room
 Battery lasts a day with heavy use

 I canst give a smile 5 for this phone
 Moto-E is far better than its G variant
 With total 4 os Moto E is an excellent phone operating at 1GB RAM, however G is not at all unto expectation in terms of its speed it laws slightly and heat up while downloading apes and games
 its undoubtedly a sleek and matter finish handset, while its back panel is weaker than E variant
 I think it should operate at 2 os ram with a battery charger with a USB port cable and may be a good phone then
 I also wonder whether the 16 os storage is there or not comparing Moto E with similar applications and lot of games in it I think 16 os capacity is not virtually available in the system
 Flipkart needs to verify and review it technically

 His has review has been long due so all get right to it
 The moto G and Men that i had purchased about a week ago abruptly stopped working due to a battery issue after calling up various service centers with a little bit of research - reason being the battery could not hold a full charge for more than 4 hours - Even on standby.
 I had requested Flipkart for a return/exchange which got rejected - tried the second time and got rejected again hope the rd times the charm
 Buyers - a word of advice please do take the reviews seriously before purchasing a dismounted product on flipkart.
 Especially when to comes to purchasing electronics

Chinmoy Debnath
 It is a good product at this price and I recommend it to my friends
 But always there is more expectations as I felt that if the RAM is 2 os and battery is at least 2800 mAh, it would be outstanding with little more cost
 Display is quite good and in normal use I found there is no lagging while playing games except some hi end stuff
 Studio is very clear but headphone is difficult use for long time as there is no soft bud which can plug into the ear hole

 no problem in speed
 Storage is around 12 go so you can install as many apes as you want no problem with any game Camera is very good...selfie is also very good all definitely suggest this for anyone if his budget is under 10000 os

 Works prefect as expected no heating issues
 Battery is not that great which is usual with most smartphones.
 Of you are average user not gaming or too much of g usage it can last till you go to bed
 Camera perform descend @ day light but and perform poor @ low light
 Only 720p os video and not 1080p video

 when flipkart guns comes to pick my old mobile then its saying they canst accept mobile if its screen is damaged
 I said its not mention in term and condition while placing order
 I called customer care to understand this issue
 they told me to check how exchange work section before placing the order
 i asked why its not mentions in terms and condition

Gaurab Bose
 I bought this phone on Jan'15 and was really impressed with the performance
 But it started slowing down after 4-5 months
 I will try to list out the pro & sons Positive 1. Awesome display at this prices
 The fixed density and the scratch proof screen is really value for money
 2. The camera quality in outdoor is superb for indoor its average
 3. Touch screen sensitivity is also very good
 4. New utilities like Moto Assist & Alert are really useful
 5 Negative 1. RAM is Os only
 To at start it might seem to be enough but later when you have 2-3 open apes the performance starts degrading
 2. Battery is not strong enough to survive one day of moderate usage
 Beaming excluded 3. The earphone sucks bedtime plus no volume control option
 To considering the Moto go out in the market and price dropping down it is indeed a great choice in this price range
 But again after 4-5 months the performance degraded drastically.

 hollow every body overall performance is very nice
 But first issue which I am regularly facing is that when I start my phone it shows error that unfortunately the process.com
 android.phone
 stopped after this all my contact & call logs get delete
 I have received phone on 27.06.2015.
 When I fond this thing is happening I have requested to return my phone to Flipkart for software issue
 When I received call from Flipakart I have been told to rest the phone
 I have done accordingly & it worked for 10-15 days
 But now still I am facing the same issue
 And now I canst return the phone as 30 days are over
 Second one is when enable "Adaptive Brightness it doesn work at all dont know what exact happens but brightness remains the same as it is in dark room also and in lighted room also
 I am giving rating on the basis of above issue faced by me but as I said above all other things are working properly but due to first issue some times I feel irritating

sreerup roy
 I had purchased this product with lot of expectations
 while it really met for exceeded those expectations mostly it failed on some of the basic features - led to real disappointment
 The positive things first - Really good grip and smart look - Google apes smartly integrated - Very competitive prices - Excellent picture and video quality shoots really well in low light conditions - Hard scratch proof screen so u need not even put a screen cover - Enough storage space and dual SIM shots - Fig screen size to fit in all the most used apes and modifications Now the negative - The battery life is a real showdown - have to charge everyday irrespective of use - Not possible to personality ringtone - SMS does not have one of the most useful feature - drafts - To touch screen feature to turn the phone to silent / vibrating mode - Door quality head phone - The charger should have detachable data cable - Creating profile is not possible - Burns slow when multiple applications are used Though I would still rate this in the mid range of the scale given that it helped me to upgrade in terms of the enhancements I was looking for in a smart phone
 Met me know in case any of you disagree with me or finds this review helpful

 One vivid evidence is Display appears yellowish in color

 I purchased the product on Dec'14 and after 07 months of use suddenly it was not getting ON.
 Since it was under warranty I contracted flipkart for authorized service center in Allahabad which is nearest city from my location
 I was told by flipkart that SRK Electronics is the authorized service center in allahabad.
 Once I reached there I came to know that the service center has been closed since very long
 There was another address mentioned there which was claimed to be authorized one
 Therefore I visited there after examining the mobile I was told that since the mobile has been water damaged so warranty will not be covered and Os 450 would be charged
 It was also informed that if more that 450/- would be the repair cost then prior permission would be taken from me
 Next day when I contracted service center I was told to collect the mobile
 After reaching there they told that it would cost Rs5500/- as repair cost of the mobile
 I refused to give such huge amount and take back my mobile unrepaired
 Once again I contracted flipkart for giving wrong address of service center and services I received and requested flipkart to collect my mobile for repair as it is there fault for giving wrong address
 Flipkart refused to do so and gave me address of another service center
 I did not expect from Flipkart for providing such bad service for their flagship products
 I will definitely escapade the matter for their poor after sales services to customers
 THIS os os LAST PURCHASE FROM FLIPKART.
 GOOD BYE

 it was fast and responsive when i bought it
 After using it for 5 months my view changed
 its lagging and big time and occasionally hangs as well
 But i guess reason is 1GB RAM.
 Pp are getting heavier with each update and takes lots of processing and RAM.
 Battery life is very average and does not perform well in Os environment
 By verdict : os Moto Os is out with 2 os of ram on 16GB mode and 13 os cam , go for it

 I was a moto genet user first
 I was very happy with that products
 After an year I purchased this phone .
 I am sorry to say that but this phone isn that good than moto G1.
 The phone was dead slow
 I tried to reach the flipkart support and requested for an exchange
 I got a call from them and they asked me to install an pp which will run few tests and show them my phone condition
 I was asked to do a factory rest and told that if the issue is still persisting then we will accept the exchange
 I accepted it and when I did a factory rest the phone the problem remains the same
 His time when I requested an exchange
 I got a call from the customer support and the guy who called me this time was awesome.
 os ACTUALLY TOLD os os RUN A SINGLE APP os A TIME AND ASKED os os CLOSE ALL OTHER BACKGROUND ACTIVITY.
 I was thunderstruck with his statement
 I explained him that even my number-pad shows up after 5-10 seconds when I want to dial a number but he was not even listening to my statements
 I also told him that I have used both the generations of moto G and I would know if something is wrong with the devices
 It last he told me to go to Motorola service center and give a check thereof they are accepting that this phone has problem then FLIPKART WILL ACCEPT THE EXCHANGE.
 I have lost confidence on this site after this purchase

 i Restored my system n upgrade the Android Software many a times but it didn help
 I just had shifted to another city so finding the service centre was itself a great problem , still at last i managed to find a Service Centre of Motorola and gave it for serving which took more than 2 weeks .
 Even after so much of suffering i m still strugglelling with the device os Motorola is a trusted Os because of its good Quality of products but in my case i canst write a single good word os i was thinking of outing for rd gen too when i bought this product but i dont think its a good idea any more

 I was a big fan of MOTO Os and Os before two experiences I have faced recently
 os in two months mother boards needed to be replaced due to technical issues and overhearing os os I have given MOTO Os in service from last 1 week and still the customer care is given same answer that it will take minimum 15 days as part is not dispatched by the respective authority..!!, They gave assurance that part has been ordered on the same day only but delay is from authority side..! Of you compare with any other companies they all give assurance that mobile will be repaired within 5 days
 Now can we survive without a good mobile for 3 weeks if you do not have same kind of smart alternate mobile option..??
 I tried to contact authority also but no reply I have received... os His is the most worst service I have seen in my life and I was thinking to buy MOTO Os in exchange but rather going with MOTOROLA it is good to go with other company if company can not understand its responsibility to provide sufficient on-time service

 I bought MOTO G and gen on with july 2015, got the delivery on time but the product was faulty , Motorola technical came and told me that the fault can be fixed and asked to return the product to flipkart.
 I did so and flipkart said they will replace it with a new one , which they did but the new moto g box was tempered
 I refused to take it and asked them to replace it , they replaced it again and sent me a new phone but this time the packing was worst then before seal broken and then to cover it a face seal had been put which was not neat at all , a st class kid would tape it better then them
 I again refused to take the product and finally after a month of trauma they refused my money
 I am highly disappointed with Flipkart for such a shabby deal
 They should have a check on their vendor and make sure their customer gets unused phone and not the replaced products
 When I contracted Motorola they said if moto g product has more then one colored strip on the box that means it had already been replaced by some other buyer and in both the cases boxes had 3 and 4 strips respectively
 Please be aware of such frauds as you will be spending your hard earned money and I bet you will not like a replaced product delivered to you.Unfortunately there is no Hero rating

 I bought this phone 3 months back.....from 1 month it started making problems.....low battery back is inherent drawback.....and then volume and power buttons started making problems....mow volume down button is gone.....worst thing is motorola service .....they are only to squeeze blood out of the customer....they say that phone is having issue with switch and we will change the whole motherboard.....which will cost you 80% of the cost of phone...... Therefore if you want harassment yourself then go for motorola.....

 They delivered me a faulty device when I requested for a replacement of that they couldn deliver to the requested address
 After the first attempt their customer care executive done from their end to make sure the deliver it to updated address
 After 1 week when it came for delivery it went again to the old address
 After 2 and half weeks this exercise they understood there is a separate team handle this kind of escalation, they promised I will get a call from them and they will address this concern
 They send me mail and messages promising date and time
 After waiting 5 days nothing happened
 When I called back the executive he saying the same story about of team
 His time he saying 24 hours but he doesn know what is the next course of action if it didn happens from them
 After eating on my money not even a single person shows any sort of responsibility
 They just keep on pushing things now its been more than a month him carrying a faulty products

 I am a mobile phone enthusiast and have used multiple phone over time
 Moto G 2014 is the best phone among them considering the stability and reliability
 Since its a near stock version of android, things feel more optimized.
 Its fast and smooth comparing almost all other phone in that price range
 Only negative factor about this product is its high SAR value

 The first moto Os bought by me faced technical issues within three months
 namely issues with unresponsiveness and last
 and a month later the same was totally unusable.
 Assuming that the issues were caused by my usage habits i bought a second moto G2, which worked well for 5 months following which the phone suddenly switched off and would not start again
 His time however i took it to a moto care centre where they want me to change the Logic board
 which they themselves claim is hard to replace and will cost about 80% of the price of the phone
 However the phone is still under warranty but the moto care centre says the logic board is not covered under the warranty
 I have been hearing rumors of Flipkart selling low quality and even used phone to customers
 after being a loyal customer for such a long time
 I am starting to consider believing the rumors
 Absolutely disgusted by the after sales by motorola.
 I agree that the phone is very good but that is only if it actually works
 The warranty is truly namesake The right thing for you guns to do would be to replace my device
 It doesn seem to be much to ask for
 Regards Vishwajeet Suresh.

 His is the first time I bought something from flipkart because people say it was good
 But it is proved that online shopping is the biggest fraud business running now
 I had bought a Moto Os phone from you that phone is not at a good make I dont know if there is some manufacturing defects it sometimes doesn take signals gets heat up couldn even play a nice game or watch a movie
 I have tried to return that and again worst service
 The webster shows what is the progress what you are doing but guess what you guns are not actually not doing anything
 I had tried to call so many times every time its busy n busy and when you guns call you discontent the call in 2 rings and when i ring back it doesn connect
 And finally today i get the message that it has been rejected
 I now understood why people say dont buy from flipkart.
 I was so happy that I was getting a new phone and paid with cash
 But will never this to anyone.Now its a waste phone
 West advice never to online shopping go to the stores see the phone touch the product you want to buy and only then when you like it then buy it
 Avoid Online Shopping

 Con's: Charger - poor quality and takes hell lot of time to charge
 Letter use USB charging
 Battery Lockup Door / cheap earphones in box
 Studio output is low compared to other branded mobile
 Lip cover from Moto is pathetic...
 I guess flirt is china lips on this brand name... Really pathetic Initially you will not face problems but on usage for months (6/7) u will start seeing that your mobile hangs and struck frequently

 i have brought this phone for my mother as her birthday gift
 Happy to hear that she was pleased and found no faults
 The phone as an amazing boot up speed it starts in like 20-25 see in age
 I found that the phone had no pre installed apes it was fully empty as for that depth
 When i opened the pack the box contained only a replaceable screen guard with the tying other than that there was no screen guard his was not expected
 Camera is exceptional the contrast and brightness is adjustable so not bad at all
 takes practice to get some accurate stills
 Round is good pretty amazing and has good clarity the ear buds provided in the box seem to do a fair job excellent for calls but not up to mark on music
 so over all happier with the buy

 His phone is not worth the money
 You may get a new type of phone with cool looks and Android 5.0.2 lolipop but to be specific it starts malfunctioning after 3 to 4 months
 Screen becomes less responsive
 Shone hangs frequently
 camera loose clarity
 RAM is not enough as per the phone functionalities.
 It should have been 1.5 to 2 GB.
 But yes one thing can be praised of it is that it candles 2 him very effectively
 Also the speakers are designed much better and are loud & clear
 To for other option if you have instead buying this one
 Overall Satisfactory

 Superb Mobile but call quality is poor : His is my honest review on Moto word gen Ought this phone with lot of expectations only to be disappointed!!!
 Although this phone seems to be a good package for 13K, after using it for 5 days I felt I wasted 13K on this one
 All clarity is very poor and also there is buzzing sound in the background
 It hurts when basic feature of call clarity itself is poor
 I felt call clarity is far better in other low cost handiest compared to this one
 Overall I would not recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for good voice clarity
 Advantages Build quality Superb Camera superb Battery back up Good

 I am having the impression of Moto G which is very good phone but Os really disappointed me and found few bad experiences
 after 2-3months 1. while in the call the device is getting over heated might be battery part 2. Touch sensitivity is bad and some time it will not work need to report it again
 3. I had bad experience while browsing battery is draining even phone is fully charged in the morning
 i charging my phone full after the the battery icon shows 1%, after rest your phone your battery his shows 60%..(sometimes)

 Mobile is overall good as this was my first motorola phone but the battery needs to be charged twice in a day...so if I am out for a day need to think twice on using my data pack or else the phone is dead end of the day
 To one star less..... Second star less as I received a faulty piece first from flipkart when ordered was delivered and had to return it back...
 I suggest motorola should also provide a USB charger instead of direct attached cable so we can charge it from laptop.

 Worst Mobile To Battery life , less than 12 hours
 Most of the features not there which is available in the 5233 Hangs Internet is major issue an explanatory icon comes near network and then it does not try to re-connect Some times complete network goes off for 1 or 2 mind and comes back later
 Os i have turned on the missed call alert daily i get 2 to 3 alert saying they tried reaching you
 That means that network was not getting captured properly by moto go Wont think its network issue because i am using Airtel.
 Totally a worst mobile , better to buy honor mobile

 I bought this phone based one of my friends recommendations he is using this phone for last 9 months placed the order on th July and received the item on with July.From the next day morning itself issues started.In the morning,the phone display was not turning os even if i press the power button,but the ratification light was blinking and I tried to call to this mobile from my friends no.The phone was ringing but the display was not getting ON.I force reported the phone to turn on the display!!.
 I thought that it was due to some settings problem and I approached the friend who is having MotoG2 phone tried to find the setting issue all the settings in my phone was same as his phone..We restored the factory settings according to the instructions from Motorola customer support team...but the problem still persists..so I requested for replacement on th August and waiting for reply from the flipkart.Another issue which i have noticed in my phone is the speaker noise while we calling..there is some disturbing noise in my phone while we calling.It is also getting heated during calling

 It has everything that one might want to have in an Android phone
 Also the look is very sophisticated 1 os RAM is the downside but that fine took
 I got it for 8000 in exchange for my Micromax Goodge phone
 BTW I have switched from my shone Os and made this my Primary Shone as we all fought for Freedom long back and you are never free with an iPhone.
 In fact in my opinion you pay apple a huge amount only to be enslaved by them
 In this price range it is the best phone in fact even people who have budget for 15K should by this one on the rd generation

 First of all ism very happy with the service of flipkart, in-terms of their speedy & safe delivery of the products guns you rock!".
 And secondly about the phone this is one of the amazing phone from Motorola, well versed with all the andros features which would definitely enhance your smart phone usage experience
 His phone comes reloaded with Lollipop version of andros which lets you experience the rich features of all the Google products
 The only thing i regret is flipkart launched the Moto go version right after i bought Moto go Damn it!".
 Never mind ism cherishing my moment with this new phone
 Last but not the least flipkart, keep on doing the good work
 Thank you

 I want to give 3.5/5 but that not an option so 3 Its almost 4 months since I am using this phone
 U can rely on my opinion though I am not an expert but an aid user of smartphones and a teno week and have used mobile with almost all platforms Windows Android and IOS.
 To here the review for Moto G and Men - 1. Looks Awesome.
 2. Battery : Lasts only 12-14 hours with normal usage (whatsapp, games internet surging etc 3. Camera Heard Very Good for outdoor photos with sufficient lighting but not very good in dim light
 The in-built camera pp is superb has manual focus HDR, panorama
 4. Camera Front : Perfect for self who needs 5MP for self this 2MP is enough 5. Performance : LAGS A LOT. U load it with apes and it will start lagging
 The 1GB RAM can do much work I guess
 Also I think its not the phone but the Lollipop Android OS which makes it slow
 6. Display : Superb
 Amazing picture quality
 Watch os video u will enjoy watching it on Os 7. Built : Very well built
 U can always trust Motorola for its strong hardware just like Nokia).
 It fall down twice or maybe thrice but this Morning Gorilla 3 with Scratch proof Glass is superb nothing happened not even a scratch
 Conclusion : For normal mobile usage girls and elders Os is the best smartphone in this price range but if u are an aid user fetch navvy guns like me then better go for Moto G rd Men

 I bought Moto-G 2 gen for my mother
 The started using it after 15 days of delivery
 From and day onwards this phone started behaving abnormally
 Its touch is is not working
 Also it hangs for hours even my mon is unable to start it
 Sometime the whole screen goes blank
 Initially I told my mon that this may be some temporary issue and will be solved after restoring the phone to factory settings but even after that the phone is kaput.
 I have raised a request for replacement of the phone
 Its almost more than a weeks but there is no progress
 Initially some technical expert from Flipkart contracted and told that they will do the debugging and asked to install some software but after that nobody contracted then someone from Flipkart called and told that they will be delivery a new phone and will take back the old one
 Afterwards there no progress nobody is contracting us
 His is really professional behavior from Flipkart's end
 I have bought so many phone earlier from Flipkart and there war no issue in delivery but now when they have exchange the phone they do not bother to contact the customers
 His is really worst experience which I have faced while using commerce online service

Shobhit Srivas...
 have been using the Moto G for quite sometime now and feel its an overall value for money products
 and recommend looking for other option in the same price range if you wish to use multiple applications simultaneously since the phone starts to hang a bit
 That is obvious with a 1GB RAM thought
 Otherwise the usage is pretty smooth with a decent look and feel
 To for it if your looking for a budget phone with the latest version of Android and a good customer service response
 Cheers

 Ought the phone in March 2015.
 Other board crashed within 2 months
 It was replaced by service centre free of cost due to warranty period
 Even then it still has problems
 It hangs all the time & it does not receive any signal due to which the him card needs to be removed & put back all the time
 Os the mother board crashed all data including songs & photos got erased
 Unable to receive calls Called flipkart and they cool said that as the 30 day replacement period is over nothing can be done about it
 To help from their side
 Ought it at Rs.12000/-.
 os NOT BUY THIS PHONE, os os TOO OVERHYPED!!! Have a Samsung Os & it is an awesome phone!!! Giving a 1 star as I have to give a rating
 Otherwise is it zero

 moto go is impressive when it comes on camera but battery is the real pain

 I had received the Moto G phone with the a defective charge
 I asked for the new charge but the Flipkart refused my request and just returned Rs.400 to my wallet which can be used only buy stuffs from os retail!!!), as the cost for the charge
 I may get a charger for Os 400 from any local manufacturer from the Flipkart web itself but I feel created because I prefer to have a charger from the same Moto Os which generally cost more than 1000.
 And it is not even available to buy
 I have been a frequent buyer from Flipkart, and now began to look for other online sellers
 The message I got from Flipkart.
