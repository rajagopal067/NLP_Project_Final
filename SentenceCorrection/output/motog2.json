 I am highly surprised and dissatisfied to Now than my mobile mother board is facing a problems I had purchased this phone in the month of Rep and within months I face motherboard issue
 I am even more worried and irate by the time taken for service Its been said that the service will take at least 15 working days as spare parts are not readily available
 I am also not been given proper feedback as for the reason as to why there is a problem with the motherboard and I am worried if the repaired hand set will meet my exceptions in future
 Would appreciate if I could get a assurance from Moto team that the repaired hand set will not have any problem and if you would arrange for the parts adapt
 The details of the hand set is given below
 Service Centre : os Technologies, Egmore, Chennai os Number YXE/MG/14/00847 os Later 29-12-2014 Model Moto G and (GEN) XT1068- Black I am totally dissatisfied with the delayed service and the quality of your products I always prefer Samsung phone but for the first time wanted to try moto and got my lessons learned

 First of all salute to flipkart for not keeping their words
 They always deliver before their promised date
 But flipkart should have checked the product before selling
 Battery dies within 12 hour to Hero percent
 I have kept my location os and only much needed application are running no game installed even if i talk for 15 mind battery dies within 5 to hours
 I would not suggest anybody to buy this phone you better throw your money instead of buying this phone
 Charging time is 6 hour and discharging is less than that
 That is the use of phone if it is not ON.
 His phone sound is worst than any phone I have used
 1300 rule phone has better sound than 13000(this) phone
 I request you not to buy this phone
 India already has a lot of poverty please help some needy with your money instead of buying this chinese cap
 All ply ply ply ply wont buy this phone... wont even try to test buy yourself

 Its also good for gazing and I didn notice any laws as such played barry & bruce temple run modern combat

 I had a moto g st generation which was a very good phone apart from its multitasking ability
 Because of its 1 go ram and not so great RAM management it was very aggressive in killing the background applications
 Sometimes it used to happen that I am making some payment through the come brother and when I switch to essaying pp to see the OTP password and then switch back to Chrome, the payment page used to get refreshed and the whole thing had to be repeated again
 It was frustrating.
 Recently I had bought Moto G and generation and the same multitasking problem is present in this phone as well was the RAM and RAM management is same as the st generation
 Another major issue I have found with and generation which was not present in the earlier version is its battery life
 The phone drains quite a lot of battery power even when it is idle
 In checking which apes are draining the battery I found that Well Standby is taking lot of juice out of it next to Screen - which obviously is the top battery consumer
 To when you take your phone in the morning you will find that the battery is several notes down from what you left it in the night.This drainage issue was not there in the st genu
 I think there is some software issue related to this and if Motorola is listening was it has been highlight by many users in the official Motorola forms then it should be rectified in the next software updated
 All said and done the phone can still manage to get you through a normal day of usage
 To all in all Moto G and gen still remains the best phone to buy in this budget with some issues related to multitasking ability and battery life
 To other complaints till now even after using the Moto G for more than 10 months must and and gen combined

 I am comparing Moto Os Os Men one 5 Os Gumma 730 These are the Mobile I was deeply done a research & Finally got the Moto G2.
 Note Us Zenfone 5 is already gave Lift to By wife
 To I am user of both Sobs
 Review now Fro Os Men 5 Os Gumma 730: ================== 1. Bandy Mob while Comparing to zenfone 5. zen 5 is bigger & quiet tough to chat 2. Cam is better then Men 5 when we use Clash
 Men 5 will give dull white shaded while flash
 3.Sound is crisp & good in Moto G2. 4.OTG is given .
 To we can use External USB for seeing moves
 not in Lumia.
 5.Windows Pp are not fast & not Letter UI.
 When we see B messenger Naukri etc 6.Caller Voice is Sleek & Accurate
 Men 5 has issues
 It can be heard when we travel in train or Must
 Sons ==== 1. Charging Take nearly os 15 hours to get completed
 His is the problem in all the Android.
 Gumma 730 is fast 2. Met Speed is not fast when we use Os Monthly Data Backs when compared to Lumia.
 But without any good Pp UI, fast can be benefit to you in windows
 3.No separate USB Cable
 Note ==== Review is based on 1 week usage of Moto go & 6 months usage of Men 5 & 1 or usage of Gumma (520).

 Thanks to flipkart.
 Moto G is worth for the price with smooth & speed simple & no unnecessary apply and attractive design
 I was disappointed that Family language was not included in language & input settings
 I surprised if KitKat dont have Family language option because Samsung dues S7582 with Jellybean is with us which has Family

 Moto Os a good buy for states not for heavy users like me
 Wanted to purchase Moto X st gen,due to non availability I bought this.Now repenting for it
 To refund policy from flipkart which is annoying
 Rose Front Speaker quality is good
 One hand operation is possible os Sons Not a heavy camera
 Shalt 8 crashed few times but hey not every time.It is strange that 1 go is not enough for andros honest
 Not a good multitask mobile
 Battery life is not good(6-8 his maxim
 Liable Vocation to save battery is quite a annoying thing in every Android honest
 Takes more time to charge
 U have to spend little more money to purchase 1 may charge
 Basically stock andros , sometimes I feel am I using Micromax series mobile
 Performance is below part
 Touch sensitivity is not great
 To rd party theme work good on it Letter to use stock andros itself
 To for Zenfone if u need classic look smooth UI.
 I think in coming days even 3 go RAM might not be enough for andros phone
 Strange it is
 Final words Below ask this is ok.for states since it is from Google ,android OS updated for sure.Buy Power bank along with this phone.People who look for performance based this is not the mobile for you

 With the Samsungs and Apples in market buying phone was coster than buying a 2 wheeler with shelf life of 1-2 years
 Were comes Moto G first incarnation) which changed the perception of smart phone in terms of value offering at competitive prices
 About Moto G and Men It is a well balanced phone with os screen and stock Android OS, latter helps the user get the best of each new OS that Android launched at times with its share of bags as well..), this is something Samsung users can only dream after paying 3 times the money 1 os RAM does much more than actually required and thanks to stock OS, it works ore efficiently
 Camera 8MP does its job extremely well in day light and with HDR mode defaulted, you can be guaranteed with good pictures
 Its equally poor at dusk and low light conditions
 Build quality is very sturdy with metal frame body giving it a tough feel
 Sons a Feels slightly bulky when compared with other phone but no deal breakers by Curved back panel makes it little inconvenient while using
 Extra back cover solved the issue c Charger & ear phone are massive disappointments
 Charging cable is not detachable and hence one needs a separate cable to connect the device with laptop.
 Flipkart keeps continuing its great show of rapid quick delivery and customer focused service
 Not a good deal at INR 9000 after exchanging my good old os Curve 9300.

 I bought this phone a week back
 The speakers are not working fine
 When a person calls me the person is able to hear their voice echo
 Also if there is any background application that is running and I receive a call at the same time , able to hear the background application sounds when i am on call
 There is no way that I could cut off the background application noise when a call is in progress

 Met me not senate the overall product as it is one of the best phone that you can buy at this budget with guaranteed andros updated
 His review is particular to the unit I have got from Flipkart.
 Firstly I am completely disappointed with the quality of the latest lot of Moto G2's that are being sold
 I purchased this devices on with Dec 14 and the issues that I am facing with the product are 1.
 There is a slight went on the left hand side of the phone from day one
 Immediately bought a cover from Flipkart itself and started using the same
 2. Shone started lagging a lot and I rest the phone
 Still occasional laws can be seen
 3. Battery sucks big time on this particular device
 Have to charge least 3 times a day with only mail and call usage
 By previous Moto os have had 3 before gave me a days battery life
 4. Occasional heating of the phone
 5. Display quality is worse than previous Moto G 2014's.
 I had raised a replacement request with Flipkart on with Dec 14 and they assured they will call me on with Dec itself
 To call but I received SMS that they tried reaching me
 All lies
 I was in network full day and didn receive any calls
 A call to customer care has assured me of a call today
 To calls yet
 Had service FLIPKART to your Flipkart First Subscribers
 Check my records and you will find my shopping history with you
 Hence think twice before you purchase this device specially the new lot
 Check for debts on the metal part right at the beginning
 Updated FlipKart called up and did what was needful
 Thanks FLIPKART!!!

 When am in roaming my Moto G Men 2 was not taking my home network instead it is taking other network eventhough my home network is stronger equal to the one selected automatically Sometime my moto g wont take any network os Useless Product may be my piece is useless In short good stuff with poor battery....

 got this phone 1 week back ago for Developing n Resting Pp since it has got Stock Android and quicker updated may receive update ASAP .
 well at first the benchmarks score were pretty good phone is extremely good at these 1.Camera : since it has got 8 up picture quality is super fine dont use the booming feature it sucks n the Front cam is too good in day light , tried making video calls on skype,viber etc Low Motion Video is a better move dont expect miracles .
 2.Performance : i have installed more than 90 apes none moved to sd card memory checked with the multitasking none of them crashed if u use 4 apes consistently the since the Stock andros consumed less Am I hardly get 350-200 mb free so i rooted moto g managed to get 500 mb removed the moto g apes such as assist,alert etc these apes were consuming lots of ram , 3.Browsing : i enjoyed browsing n reading on this device 5 inch vagrant display,good viewing angles i also managed to watch moves online on os brother by installing Flashplayer ask
 4.Gaming : Am not an Extreme game , anyhow managed to tested games like dead trigger,riptide,NFS,GTA,batman , which are below go of size , tried plain Shalt laws a bit
 this phone aunt for games wished it had 2 go ram for excellent gaming experience 5.Sound: the Dual speaker in the front are good , audit is not so crisp n clear , my advice install POWER AMP for music lovers , Google Lay music Sucks anyhow !
 another big is u can use or headphone mid buttons for changing the music tracks only comes with sony,samsung,asus,xiomi since they got customized UI n functionality 6.Battery: Battery seems to drain up quickly if u turn on the If or Cellular Fatal used my phone unto 14 his with heavy usage of Wifii.
 try installing os battery saver,Battery Doctor for saving juice
 It feels comfortable holding in one hand , the only 2 sons i have found is 1 go of RAM n not so great Battery Back up that all about the review my advice is u to all purchase phone within 15 k i bought samson Os for 36 k still in jellybean lots of Rugs almost thrashed my phone away,after 1 or now at the half price i get similar speck n a better phone n quicker updated i change my phone for every year co i only invest unto ask It last i hope u guns find this Review Helpful :-)

 I have bought this phone from Flipkart.
 Flipkart delivered it very fast and thanks to Flipkart.
 I have been using this phone since 45 days
 I have observed the following things and thought my review would be helpful to fellow mates
 I am not at all convinced with this phone
 I have used Android phone from other vendor before I bought Moto G and genu
 Rose 1.
 It is from Motorola.
 2. Took and Feel is okay okay
 Sons To many sons are there and i am putting down few main cost
 1. Network drops frequently for no reason
 2. Battery drains with in no time compared to other phone which i have used
 It takes lot of time to recharge.
 3. Twitch to vibration mode and then come back normal profile
 After few minutes / seconds it goes back to Nitrate mode automatically
 4.
 You cannot delete selective messages in a specific conversation
 I had this feature in a different mobile which i bought three years back 5.
 You cannot delete all the contact in one go
 :((((( that horrible
 I didn see the features
 6.
 It doesn provide Mile Manager
 You have to depend on external apes from Android. and the list goes on

 I purchased a moto G and generation from this webster and within 3 months i experienced two major issues with the phone , firstly my phone began to hang within 10 days of receipt and the same was replaced with a new one...
 However the motherboard to the new phone crashed within 1 and half month of receipt of the replaced phone rendering me handicap and phoneless.. Thereafter I requested flipkart guns to replace the phone as I have never heard of the incident that a motherboard crashing of a brand new phone
 After writing several email to flipkart, they finally decided to reply to my email saying they will revert in 2 days which needless to say they conveniently slip the deadline and did not revert.And on being inquired again they only repeatedly gave me the option of taking my phone to he service centre and that they cannot offer me any more assistance than this very curtly put across to me
 Worst is my phone is now lying with the service centre for more than 10 days and every time i visit them they tell me that they will take 2 more working days as they do not have the required part and the same has to be imported from USA.
 There are nearly 6 service centres in Lumbar with none possessing the required part
 Because of he whole fraud committed by this platform which encourages vendor to sell defective phone I am rendered handicap without a phone and regretful of my idea of buying a phone online from this webster ... It is therefore requested to everyone out there to not buy Moto G and generation for we Indians who believe in good quality phone would not appreciate such major bundles and issues in the phone within just 1 and half months of receipt precisely
 os not even deserve one star but had to hit on the rating star as it was mandatory I have experienced the issues which any person would face at the rear end of a phone life ... It is really disappointing to purchase goods from this webster because even though I have paid the money for a brand new phone I have received a defective piece...
 The shopping experience on flipkart has really been a sour one...
 I feel cheated..

 A black line appeared on the screen within two months no proper response from customer care I had to give the phone to customer care centre which was overcrowded in chennai just for depositing the phone i had to wait for one hour they have told that it will take 10 days to replace the screen .
 i dont know why this much time is required
 any ways overall not happy with motorola customer service will not buy any motorola product again .

 Key guns 0 Thanks to Flipkart for delivering it within one day though I did not choose the option one day delivery
 About Moto G and gen which is used for months now - Advantages - Camera - Its really awesome guns the clarity is so great its more better than the samson grand os 8 os which I compared with my friend so nowadays he asks me to take a pick from Moto G 2 though he has grand 2 os Internal Memory - Oh its super cool which gives 16GB and its more than sufficient
 Processor - Moto G 2 is really fast guns
 Trust me it is or check Moto G 2 Os
 shone 6 Video in Youtube(Moto G 2 is fast as per that video
 Great for games
 Screen - its a os screen and its so clear when it comes to camera or video
 Its great to see a video or play games
 Him - Dual Him works fine also with 3G(for st him only and 2G.
 and him doesn support 3G).
 Speakers - Its really loud
 The person next to you can hear what the person at the other end of the call is speaking with you if the volume is 100% so check your phone volumes or check if any person is next to you os Built Pp - we can move apes to os card or delete which is not required except few goose apply
 Good to handle can expect a better phone for this prices
 Disadvantages - which we can see normally in other smartphones as well Battery - this is also cool I use the wife or internet almost hours a day and battery lasts for 1 day I would suggest you guns to download the battery doctor pp which helps a bit
 Initially it was draining out bit fast but after 3-5 days it got adjusted and it lasts for a day
 please judge on the battery after 3-5 days of your buying
 Heating problems - I do not see any such issues charger was getting heated up initially but now I do not see such problems and never faced this with the phone
 I was confused if I should buy a Moto G 2 or Micromax canvas Nitro.
 But I am really happy with Moto G 2 its so cool
 everyone who sees it asks for it os Of you confused which one to buy I would say go for Moto G and Men Daytime goose phone rocks

 I am not going to talk about Motorola, as i have already purchased 2 Moto G(1st Gen), 1 Moto G and Men and 1 Moto E and also referred Motorola to many of my friends
 I am talking here about Flipkart Delivery and Response on my request to deliver soon
 I had function in my home and ordered Moto Os for lifting the mobile
 Even though there was no stock till a day before function flipkart delivered the mob on time as mentioned over the calls that they will try their best to provide it on the day of function and they did
 It was a nail waiting situation for me and had plans of buying Gumma 730 from outside mob stores
 But i had faith in Flipkart and they kept to their words by delivering it on time
 Very call with Flipkart pp was polite and requestful to wait
 Oats off to Flipkart, call centre pp delivery boy and its team
 Thanks you once again all

 him Giving 4 stars Because of the only issue.i.e Battery
 It lasts 1 May with wife turned on
 and approximately 36 Hours without wife
 The issue is the screens size.Battery is consumed by the screen basically...Anyways whereas os LAG issues
 whereas no other issues
 I dont think even Battery is a VERY BIG issue
 Nowadays Shone Comes with approximately this much of battery
 ice 2000-2800 mAh.

 Great phone
 Excellent quality
 Sons ( I am just nitpicking, go get this phone 1.Software needs updated as the phone feels sluggish occasionally and keeps killing background apply like music stops in background if you open a couple of apply
 2.The dual him management is a mess more like an afterthought.
 To separate ringtone/profiles can be set
 Number dealing is a two step process dial > press call > select him 3. Average camera ( Horrible in low light Battery lasts a day for me not more
 About 30% left at the end of day
 I use Os all the time and wife while at home
 2-3 his screen on time

 For all those Android purity like me this is the blind choice when it comes to buying a new phone
 To other device gives stock andros experience at 13K.
 DEAL BREAKERS 1.
 Stock Android 2. Promised Lollipop upgrade 3. Price PROS 1. Recent battery life of 24+ hours with 3.5+ hours of on-screen time
 will get better with Lollipop upgrade 2. Build quality is excellent very comfortable to use with one hand
 3. Sterno Speakers - most awesome speakers
 Even flagships like Os do not offer quality speakers like Motor they dont even have sterno
 4. Camera - excellent performance in sunlight photos look crisp and sharp
 Average performance in low light with flash
 COULD'VE BEEN BETTER 1. Option to turn of since completely - right now have to mentally until every option
 this is more of a stock andros problems I being an aid CyanogenMod user CONS 1. Charger with detachable USB cable - the out of box charger did not have detachable USB cable so I had to buy it
 2. Device heat up when performing things simultaneously like playing games and pp updated from play stores
 does not heat up when playing games only Of you can tolerate these very minor cost I think you should go for this device
 Its the best in this range

 Facebook, whatsapp and instagram only three applications on Os network no wife no camera no video streaming brother a couple of times to follow up with the facebook links texts only and its os already by 12.30 AM.
 Service centre executive says only replacing phone would work and nothing else
 I had suggest all you people buying to do a complete battery test least run on continuous internet so you had replace with one within the period
 Also wish for flikpart to get you an unused products

 I got the phone nicely packed
 It had all the mentioned accessories like charge headset, warranty cards manual
 The feel of the phone is great and the matt finish of the back cover gives you an amazing feeling
 It has a very soft and delicate touch
 Comparable to apple Os have an iPad).
 It has a decent primary camera
 The phone does not experience any lag and games like Shalt run seamlessly.
 Moto has provided useful apes like Assist
 However the battery back is not that great
 It drains out in under 16 hours even after very little use

 him writing this review after one week of usage the rating are for the product and flipkart and not the courier service Delhivery.
 the worst delivery by the courier service it took more than a week for the product to get delivered
 unhappy with the service of Delhivery.
 Now coming to the phone after ordering the cell i read about the device and many of them said the cell heat up a lot last takes long time to charge
 i didn face any kind of lag till now after installing many apply yes the charger bundles with the product is not up to the mark but then i changed my charger and use the one provided with my nexus os and with that charger the cell get full charged in almost one and half hours without heating
 many of them said the battery is bad but that not the cases if you are a normal user you'll get almost 16 hours of back which is the best at this price point
 for a game you can get 8-10 hours of usage
 the camera of the device is awesome, the focus control and other features simply love it
 the user interface is minimal and easy to use which i love the customization by other companies make the device last
 i didn face any issues with him cards calling function or wife connection as described by others
 the sterno speakers are the best people have said that the sound cracks you can easily change the audit effects from the settings and i would advice you not to keep the media volume at full as you may feel the difference keep it one or two times below and you'll get the perfect sterno experience
 the build quality of the phone is sturdy and fits perfectly in hand didn face any issues with the display or screen quality it works as expected
 if your budget is around 15-20k go for this product without hesitation
 none the devices from other companies can give you such build quality and beautiful looking phone a big thumbs up for Motorola and Flipkart for giving the perfect device (Delhivery you suck!!!) Moto @(2nd Generation rocks!!!!!!!!!!

 To not buy moto phone and typically from flipkart.
 To to your local store and buy samson or HTC.
 Poorly manufactured!!!! Ought two from flipkart.
 The first had issues with touch screen got it replaced
 replacement piece was fine
 Thought this was one off so bought the second one
 Again problems with the screen faded colour on the top left side of the screen
 The biggest problem is you cannot get in touch with technical department directly
 You have to register a complain with flipkart and in 48 to 72 his they will get back to you
 Very very very slow and poor service

 1. Seats up to around 55 degrees if you camera for more than 5 minutes 2.It canst even play Subways surf without laws 3.If you play even a low end game on it like temple run or Subways surf Processor heat up to 60 degrees 4.
 And most irritating thing is that sometimes iii refuses to detect signals or connect to it(even if the signal is strong 5. Antutu shows very bad chart for devices stability Note:- I checked the temperature using CpuTemp, Clean master and antutu.
 And in the end only thing i can say that is ism greatly disappointed with the product and quality check service of flipkart I ve placed the return request

 since the same day its not working properly..there is a huge speaker issue...i am sure if i continue using this phone in next week only i he to change the speakers i have only one simple question to flipkart that if we are paying so much money why the hell you guns can provide us at least decent product..product showing defects from the first day itself
 my brother has bought moto phone itself so we check the speaker quality of both the phone n in speaker quality lacks in my moto g and generation big time
 i have requested for a return.kindly

 I got a sealed moto go box but upon opening it I was bit shocked to see the plastic sheet of phone screen was bit like forged second hand set kind of work
 their was no motorola's M mark on it plus the sheet was lifted a bit plus their was couple dirt bubbles on the set
 despite of that I have tried to ignore it bc I didn had enough time to raise a long battle of getting my set replace with actually a fresh set
 os n Because am also not sure if motorola or flipkart will be sure even about which lot is fresh
 it might be some returned repacked set
 probably I should better had gone for Xiaomi the chinese brand...

 I bought this phone in last nearly 20 days having found lot of problems but i forget that case it may happens , But big problem is It can support multitasking."
 Of u minimize any pp after minutes it auto closed , even if u lock keypad.
 Or u can not play music while playing a game or in game like clash of plans keypad goes down between tying
 N also it takes lot of more time to load a online game than samsung.
 It having worst internet access i ever faced
 Of u are g user u need to forget browsing any cheaper samson or micro mobile beat itmoto go 4-5 times
 Picture quality is not good as u want , moto e having god coloured display than go ...
 About gameplay do not demand any shooting game... much last
 Camera is god than asks zone or p81.
 (Chk camera wisely my hands fails to capture white at centered photo ( n if it not responds u need to start , even for face unlocking also
 also face unlocking is not god ( any mix canvas is much better in this any other person can open it n many times herself u can open it ...epic fail
 About speed of using ...( is like running in river u can get as speed as u can do ) i m not impressed by speed animated opening takes lot of time after some use ( nearly 15 Days)... Round no doubt awesome.
 Another bad thing is u can see unload n load working or not ( an internet E log with two opposite arrows along signal System is just copy passed from moto e ...icons r bluish
 To if u are a game kind user or god internet user dont think to buy it

 I think the main issue everyone is concerned about is the battery life
 Well I can safely say that this phone has brilliant battery life
 With 3G, I get 12-15 hours without any fuss
 With WiFi, its even more
 There is also a default battery save option in Settings
 Twitch that on
 Also adjust the screen brightness when your outdoor and indoors
 Sometimes the Auto brightness indoors is quite bright and you dont require so much brightness indoors
 I use the phone a lot including media player in a day
 Of I remove my phone from charging at 9 in the morning I charge it again next morning around 7/8am.
 His phone is very good
 Not much different from the First Men
 The only thing better is the camera and the screen size
 Otherwise its just like the first genu
 And we all know how good the first gen is
 I dont want to comment on the speck as there similar to the First Men
 The camera though is quite good in low light took
 Front camera is also great in low light
 The phone comes with stock Android.
 To that another plus
 I read some reviews which described the battery life as poor hence i was skeptically before i could purchase this
 But once I bought it I have no regrets
 Yes there will be some handiest with some issues but you cannot get 100% efficiency in anything
 I would totally recommend this phone for anyone looking for high end low budget smartphone.
 It 13k, its a steal

 I have purchased Moto G and generation from flipkart.
 Shone is very good in all aspects as mentioned in other reviews but two sons i realized 1. Battery back is not up to the mark
 I am getting only 8-9 hours back in mixed usage that should be a little bit more
 For me his is a serious concern
 2. Screen quality is not that good as my phone dropped from 2 ft height and screen got broken previous phone were more robust in this aspect
 West phone is worth in this price value

 After using Samsung (S3) mind I bought Moto G and genu Looking at Type generate by flipKart....
 And today him Facing Music Yes...
 I have to make this statement because... Firstly there is an issue with the quality of speaker - when I receive call Voice is not clear to hear ( A basic need Requirement of a phone And if I have to receive call in busy traffic then god should help to understand what a called is saying Os voice is not clear
 Secondly I noticed when I receive call most time my voice reflect back to me Damn irritating
 Thirdly an ear phone given by company is another big waste ....Sound quality is very very os very bad...... Overall I can say There is no use if a phone cannot function its basic functionality" - Not worth for money I paid
 Now to Flipkart ---> Dear Flipkart, It least make sure before promoting Branding any product works well for its know basic functionality, else no customer will trust you or buy any product from you

 i asked for replacement flipkart people replaced my piece in 4 days
 But even in the new replaced Moto go the problem is the same once again getting heated up once again battery is draining really fast in really disappointed on these two issues from the cell phone
 Excluding these problems the phone is best at its quality,appearance,display,price tag,android version
 tip for the buyiers-- Think twice before buying this phone

 When I received the phone it had numerous scratches on the screen guard It seems as if the phone was a used one
 Shone hangs a lot from the very first day , Even without installing any pp
 The battery drains out very fast .
 Also it gets charged up very quickly .
 Volume key and Back button also does not work properly,it hangs.It does not work until and unless home button is pressed
 When I raised a replacement request I was told to do factory rest
 After factory rest also the same issue persists

 I had ordered Moto G and Men mobile phone from flipkart.
 The same was delivered to me on with Rep 2014.
 Suddenly on and Act 2014 the phone display was blank
 In calling flipkart , they informed that the phone cannot be replaced as it is more than a months
 While it was just 10 days above the month(11th Rep 2014 to and Act 2014).
 In calling the Service center Well and tell Teleservices) we were informed to get the phone to service center
 After 1 day service center informed that the display was damaged due to physical damaged
 Flipkart informed that the warranty cannot be claimed as it was due to physical damaged
 Either the service center nor Flipkart is able to prove the physical damaged
 He being the owner of the phone it is only me who knows if the phone had a physical damage or not
 I am very dissatisfied with the service of Flipkart and Motorola and i Think this is just a way of avoiding the claim and reimbursement of the phone
 I suggest please avoid buying least electronic items from flipkart.

 1. the battery back is not so good
 Charging takes hell lot of time more then 5-6 hours
 Battery heat up during phone usage and discharges very quickly
 I start using my phone in the morning with 100% charging
 By noon it drains to 40%.
 by 2 pm it requires fresh charging
 Very hour it will charge only for additional 10 odd percentage
 2. the phone book has some serious problems
 Opening contact displays white screen for a long time
 Contact names appear and then if I search something the contact disappear
 Application closes abruptly
 3. Similar problem happens with All logs
 Sometimes it doesn even recognise the names and only the number displays without any name when someone is calling
 4. Door Truecaller also stops abruptly
 To much with even the replacement set

 I have been a flipkart shipper since it was an Infants
 Its tragic to see the services becoming progressively worse
 Buying on this Fig Million sale was a bad decision
 I have read negative reviews about electronic goods and mobile sales on flipkart but always ignored them
 I ordered Moto G 2 for Diwali.It was delivered fine
 In 3 days the screen blinked on and off,touch got less effective and then one fine day when I woke up half display was missing and touch stopped working
 Immediately I made a contact with Customer team
 They informed by with Act they should rectify the issue but no calls from them just mobile updated
 And then Another message came that the date will be oct now
 I totally regret buying it from flipkart.
 I have asked for a replacement and since I see many reviews on that part too I shall update my review once I get replacement done..If any 31 Act I received replacement phone
 Have not yet used it and I hope it works fine
 Having read reviews here lot of people got phone replaced and they were too having defects so keeping fingers crossed

 Grand Motorola was founded in U.S, 1928 and it build Tablet computers Mobile honest Smartphones,Two-way radius wilkie talkies),Networking systems,Cable television systems,Wireless broadband networks,RFID systems,Mobile telephone infrastructure
 To it is technically more renowned brand than Foka or Samsung in Mobile phone market
 By Review is based on more than two weeks usage so it may vary at some points with others
 Looks edges are not sharp finishing is somewhat blunt and dull compared to ASUS Zenfones.
 Body Easy to hold and handle though its size is quite bigger than it may look
 Back cover is so unable and more easy to open than a bottle cap!!!! it is sealed from inside out making it water and dust resistant to an extent
 Of you take the white version of this phone you will need a phone cover to protect it from stains but you can open the phone back cover daytime and wash it and put it back Os Screen Morning gorilla glass 3 is something you may not believe before seeing
 its smoother than ice but harder than past gorilla glasses
 Still i use a Patte finish screen guard just for the looks it provided
 phone footing time 28 seas generally
 phone power off time:13 seas generally
 Shone accessibility: U.I is very smooth as it runs on Stock Android 4.4.4 as on Nexus phone only
 no default file manager pp
 To noted pp
 so many basic apes miss out in stock android.
 You will have to download them
 Os is very fast esp in Vodafone and hittel in cities Navigation is smooth
 music player is fluid except it interrupt for 0.5 seas when you tilt the phone from vertical to horizontal positions or vice versa
 call facility is fluid
 so is messaging.
 Modifications panel is nice to work with
 but ratification light is dull compared to blackberry's.
 sometimes you may face problems with receiving calls as the 'slide-n-answer' feature does not work at times but its very rare
 I am trying to find out why it happens
 Round Very LOUD! Camera Up is like Lumia's 5Mp.
 so nothing much to jump for
 but front camera of Up is good
 Battery 2070 mAh.
 With D.U Battery pp it gives you more or less 1 day/24 Hours backup.
 please charge your phone for 8 hours after buying as they say if you want proper backup.
 By Review is based on more than two weeks usage so it may vary at some points with others

 all start with an excellent delivery by Flipkart.
 I ordered the device 4-5 days before diwali, the expected delivery time was 10 days due to festive season but it was delivered to me in 3 days surprisingly
 i also ordered a moto g back case along with it which arrived the a day after that
 Moto G is a very well designed and thought out phone
 I have handed it over to many of my not-so-Tech-aware friends and they thought it was one more of those 30K phone with large screens
 whereas the look factor
 Os far as performance is concerned I switched from an shone Os to Moto Os so just comparing the two phone - I find Moto G much faster and whisper in terms of the interface
 From an Android vs in perspective there just so much more you can do with Android than iOS.
 Pp like Whatsapp, PushBullet and Good work so much well on Android due to the deeper integration possible in the Android.
 Not to mention the whole issue with downloading songs using tunes into iOS, which is such a buzzkill.
 I am a big supporter of lowed phone like Moto G now coming from a person who has been using Apple since os years
 The high end phone are not worth it
 They will give you the following things for 15K more of money
 1. NFC - Hardly accessible in India 2. Os LTE - Not widely available in India - prices still high 3. Higher resolution - I mostly use my phone for reading news articles and watching os video There is no need for full os resolution in both - The internet bandwidth in India is hardly conducing to Full os video 4. Letter battery life - I think this is the only thing in the list I would actually pay for
 But in the end the trade-off comes to be like 500-800 more of may vs Os 15K.
 I think you could get a portable power bank for Os
 3-4K the best one in the market
 To still Moto G wins
 West of luck
 whereas more to life than spending on extravagant honest
 Lay smart
 Hello Motor

 I ordered 2 phone – Moto G and genu
 Received on 25 & with September
 I had much more expectation with MOTO G2. os When i started to use phone it shut down automatically
 os Hearing voice use to stop after every 4-5 calls automatically I have to start the same after that it works but only for 4-5 calls
 I was not able to receive the call
 os Very poor battery - Charging time is more than discharging time
 os After 7 days hanging problem has been started
 os Drowsing problem – suffering during Os activation” os Shone heating problem os even with day a phone has been dead
 I am really highly disappointed with MOTO Os & dont want carry any more
 Friends Please avoid the phone otherwise I promised you will remember my words
 I dont have any problem with flipkart, I am very old costume of flipkart & first time I am facing such type of problems
 I have complained in flipkart costume care they picked up the same for exchange
 But exchange is not a ultimate solution because there is some technical manufacturing fault I am sure that still not resolved

 I have placed order on 9 September and the product had to deliver on 17 September
 They asked excuses and extended my order till th October.Finally flipkart decided to refund my money by with Act but it was not done had to call them they informed it will be refused by must Act but still the amount is not refunded.
 I do no when my amount will be refused by the time my 2 semi for this product is been processes
 His message is to all buyers from flipkart,be care full.Your money is not secure

Dr. NACHIKETHA...
 I have used two moto go phone for one months
 These are my observations
 Sons 1. Shone and the charger gets heated up badly during charging
 Shone screen turns hot while watching a video for few seconds
 Shone usually heat up during potential activities like using camera on call watching video etc 2. Touch sensitivity is not up to the mark
 3. The SAR value could be higher
 Os a result I suffer mild headache following a phone conversation which did not happen in my Foka and Samsung honest
 To using ear phone could solve the problems
 4. Battery consistency is extremely bad
 I use my phone few mind to talk in a day Check few mails and WhatsApp for few mind
 Overall a very minimal usage and yet the battery lasts for only around 6-8 hours with full charge
 5.
 The case covers and screen guards are not widely available outside
 its very expensive online
 I can as well get another phone for price of a case cover
 I have been visiting shops in my locality since a months
 6. Camera quality is just OK. 7. PPI is less compared to the moto go
 To image quality appears less crisp
 8. Looks like cheap plastic used for back case cover
 Not sturdy as st genu
 To the back case can easily break
 Rose 1. Good deal for this prices
 I got it just lesser than ask for an offer
 2. Bigger screen is an advantage and disadvantage at times
 3.
 Not much laws and hangs till date
 4. Front Sterno speakers are just great
 Ultimately a good deal for this prices

 Ordered this phone on th of Act and didst get it till with which was the expected delivery date and also no body was aware in the company by what time i will be getting it...............so over all disappointed with delivery services of flipkart.
 They should behave like a normal store and maximum delivery time should be 6 days because festive season comes once in a year and you should be prepared with all type of arrangements for quick deliveries.

 Not it on 22 October
 Was busy in dial and today i got to know that there is a distortion in its speaker while making calls and also while listening music
 Battery is average which is OK.
 Have asked for replacement and waiting what comes next

 I am a college student and so you can very well understand i am a power user was very excited regarding this phone and it has lived unto my expectations.This is a completely unbiased review of MOTO G and GEN.
 1.Looks and feels premium
 Erogonomically designed
 Only the screen guard which came with it was not good and i replaced it
 2.Camera is very good.No complaints
 3.UI is excellent.No lags.Even when running multiple background apply
 4.Only the battery is not unto the mark
 But make no mistaken hour of calls,20-30 pictures 1-2 hours of net usage(2G), and another 1 hour of screen usage will sail you through the day with 30% of charge still left when you go to bed 5.
 Those who have very sluggish internet speed after twitching to this phone...turn off location and restrict background data of Google Lay Tore and Google Services
 You wont believe the amount of background data and battery these two consumed
 Close you eyes and go for Moto Os PS- Flipkart's delivery and packing was excellent

mohamed irfan
 Great service Flipkart u have delivered my phone much earlier than the date specified Now coming to the phone the phone looks premium and processing is k at this range Gros Premium built quality Easy to hold Camera is ok Display is stunning even though its 720p An play all games at medium settings Sterno sound is awesome bones The biggest con is battery life it lasts only for 3.5 his with heavy usage but it might change with lollipop upgrade want able to play graphics intensive games in high settings Camera can be better Headphone is not at all comfortable Charges too slow takes 3 his to charge War value is high so talking long on this phone hurts a ear littlebit Overall for ask its os it doesn has any heating issues like xiaomi and it has better service help than xiaomi and it is better than zenfone 5 if gaming is your thing hope my review helps up

 Motorola already made a comeback in the Indian market with the Moto Os
 And with Moto G(2nd Men they have only done better
 With the pure stock Android KitKat performance is absolutely hassle-free.
 The phone glided through multi-tasking and once in a blue moon will you feel a pitch
 Display is crisp and bright
 Camera is absolutely good
 And it comes with an os card sloth
 All in all a fully pain vaso one for its price and competition
 P.S.- Review written after 20 days of usage
 But the experience is completely satisfactory

Saurav Srivastava
 I purchased this phone for my younger brother
 His is his first Android phone every
 That I like about Moto G is that Motorola is giving a very balanced phone at a very nice base prices
 It has all the essentials one would absolutely want from an Android phone but it doesn cost an arm and a leg
 The biggest problem with Android is that it gets slow over time
 I dont know if that will happen with Moto G also or not as this is yet to be seen
 His is an inherent Android problem and not of this hardware because Windows Shone based on same hardware such as Gumma 730 works really fast
 With the Android problem aside this phone is good enough for anyone
 It comes with a really good and sharp screen at near Retina Display quality with 1 os RAM which is enough in Android for light use with os 3 apes running in background
 It fresh boot with nothing installed this phone had only 370 os RAM left which is something I find bad
 The OS and Motorola bundles services are eating too much RAM and very less is left for users own apply
 The camera is a standard 8 os camera
 It takes good pictures in well lit conditions
 I haven been able to test low light picture quality
 Studio quality from earphones or Bluetooth handsfree is also fine
 It is big due to a lot of been around the screen
 Motorola needs to reduce this in Moto G rd generation
 Also os screen is too much
 A 4.5" screen size with higher PPI or AMOLED screen which further reduces battery consumption which is what I would recommends
 To need to give gigantic screen sizes if you want that launch another phone between Moto G and Moto Os Deep Moto G at 4.5" screen size as not everyone wants a gigantic phone
 I purchased a Sandisk Ultra 16 os MicroSD card for this phone as it is good enough to keep music pictures and video
 I only keep apes in the phone memory
 The battery could have been better
 Android is anyway not good with battery life
 I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good enough and fast Android phone at a justified prices

 First of all I have to tell that FLIPKART you are too bad Os have never seen like you
 I order this item on 6 October 2014 8:57 AM. and I got this on Due with Act Very long , very long
 May by day flipkart is going to be a worst online site
 oka now come to the point Os have recently use moto g and genet
 Its awesome but its media files system is not good while I use samsung.. all songs movie systematically stores
 that all rest of all its awesome mind blowing

 I use to be a Moto fantastic when I used back to back Flip,Razr,Rockr.
 But I can proudly say the lot of cell phone have used Almost all apart from Phone and Blackberry) this is a dream
 In this price tag him getting an amazed
 1. Display – 9/10 2. Performance – 10/10 3. Round – 10/10 Case a quality headphone) 4. Looks – 12/10 By god its looks amazingly awesome) 5. Grand – Moto is back and I cannot give this company a bad review
 All together if you are looking to by an awesome even Iphone), drop everything get this

 I bought this phone on Kept 12 and received it on 14th.
 I waited a month to write a review so I could see how the phone works after it is not so brand new
 I can now say this phone is pretty awesome.
 I am not having any problems with the battery backup.
 It lasts almost a full day with moderate usage
 Of I have iii on it lasts a little less but still gets me through the day
 There is no Mile Manager you need to get another third party pp for that like os Mile Explorers
 Android is as stock as it could get
 To bloatware at all
 Now its time for the James
 Not just normal ones but heavy games
 I play Shalt os FIFA 14 and FIFA 12; and it all runs butter smooth
 The RAM is only 1GB, but it still manages to run the game smoothly
 The only problem with the 1GB RAM is that multitasking is a little harder
 The phone is hell bent on killing apply so if you have more than 4 apes on 1 would be killed by the time you open it
 Nothing big thought
 Headphones are great
 One problem is that we canst change the Ratification LED Right
 Overall a pretty good phone
 I would recommend it to anyone

 I had personally used Moto G that my his bought and was happy to see such good quality in that prices
 the only flaw was he 5 up camera
 Moto G 2 went a step ahead with imp came
 so I booked it just the moment I realized it was released
 Despite specification being almost same the phone dint please me
 The Camera has some issues and goes off needs start of phone every now and then
 also the auto flash does not work at times the him slot also seem to have probe
 It all of a sudden disabled my him
 this is really irritating the touch also does not work properly at times specially while tying and playing games
 Flipkart please suggest a appropriate action as I am really disappointed with the problems

 Hello every body
 I purchased this phone after vigorous survey of mobile phone in the price range
 That I observed is that this product is ultimate with all features which a 20K and above mobile are providing at a price of 13K.
 Rose 1. Huge internal memory of more than 13 os in 16 GB.
 2. Excellent photos 3. West User Interface even a child can handle the features
 4. An handle even the hardware games like Real Facing 3 without any issues
 5. External memory with a capacity of unto 32 GB. 6. Dual speakers with good output
 I installed my player a free pp from playstore through which the sound is mind blowing
 7. Direct access to goose drive goose photo
 To we can have cloud store of more than 15 os of data
 Sons : 1.
 To NFC 2. Battery capacity of 2070 may could have been a little higher
 Of we use wife or play games battery life is around 6 to 8 hours
 Otherwise approve 16 hrs.3.
 To USB cable provided
 Not even screen guard is provided with the products
 4. To file manager
 I had to install a free pp called os file explorer which is a very EXCELLENT one
 Finally the service of flipkart is appreciated
 Within 2 days I got the products
 Immediately on undoing and inserting SIM, all recent software updated got installed
 Really nice
 West buy for the price tags
 You will definitely like the products
 To for it

 I have lost my trust on Flipkart.
 His review is not about the products its about Flipkart.
 I have ordered the product on with Act 2014, it was delivered on with Act because I have speed for "Flipkart First subscription for Os 500/- a years
 When I opened the package first thing that strikes is mobile has a scratch guard on it which doesn have the log of Motorola which you normally get when you purchase a product in a sealed pack condition
 I have purchased Moto e and couple of my friends have purchased Moto G from Flipkart but all had that log on the scratch guards
 Which means I had been provided a refurbished product which someone might have returned
 It was not at all expected from Flipkart, when we are footing for them against some foreign biggest they shouldn fool their customers like this
 Of you really want to sell refurbished product then you better list it out on your webster
 When I contracted their Customer Are in the middle of night after identifying the fraud instead of immediately taking the replacement request all they did was take the request for a call back from their technical team
 While today on with Act when I again contracted them another executive placed the replacement request immediately
 Since I have already subscribed for the in a day delivery the least him expecting is they provide a brand new product in a day which is with Act or latest by with Act afternoon
 However here onwards I would think twice before ordering anything from Flipkart.
 There is no need to hold a Fig Million Day", just give us good offers and good service and stop cheating
 Hoping to get a brand new product In a Day".
 - A Kissed Off Customer

 Hi...I'm not a guy who writes reviews but this is something I had to tell you about First of all,HATS OFF os FLIPKART....I told them to prioritise my order just because I had to go out of town and they listened to me....expected date of delivery -24th Act 21014, Order recieved-13th October....AWESOME!
 now the phone... 1.The screen looks awesome!
 2.I have installed a lot of apes on this phone and haven faced any kinds of laws till now..... 3.The camera quality is decent.... 4.The Motorola dimple on the back is something I like Must a suggestion for people who aims agent working..there is a click sound when you put the him inside....so its like putting an os card....so its not a big deal .
 Its a bang for the buck....BUY THIS PHONE!!

 I bought this product from Flipkart recently and it has proved to be a worthy buy
 The camera is really good especially the so mo video capture in 720p) with all the features mentioned in the specification area and the the 1.2GHz processor with the 1GB RAM works perfectly
 The phone is fast
 Touch has a little bit of problems
 The only drawback is that the battery is poor
 Even though 2070mAh sounds pretty cool and fancy but the battery hardly lasts 12 hours
 Even without playing any games and with battery save on him having to charge the device around twice a day
 But overall with all the speck the phone is worth the money
 The pulse ratification light is handy
 all say buy it

 Have ordered Moto G under exchange scheme on so called big billion day and got my order delivered on 11/10 however as soon as opened the phone to my shock it seems to be the used one moreover defective display have quickly called up customer care and placed the return request

 Still waiting to get some kind of response from flipkart.

 It first I was really disappointed about this phone as I received a defective product....But thanks to Flipkart and its awesome service my phone got replaced
 Must say a one of the best phone available in market at this price range.You wont find any good branded mobile under this range with so many functions
 Features that needs special mention : -------------------------------------------------- * Super cool and sleek design
 gave a now feeling when i opened the box * Crisp os os display(720p).
 * Camera - 8MP takes pick with good clarity 2MP - great selfish
 * Speakers - Simply superb - Literally blown away by the Sterno speakers - Awesome os * 16 os internal memory + Micro os card sloth
 * Android 4.4.4 with sure upgrade to "Android L". * Had core speed - tried few games Of you use Moto G lip cover then that donna blow your mind...it makes your mobile look like a premium phone and believe me you dont anna take your eyes off this phone
 The grip is class and its sleek design gives you a WOW feeling
 Must say Motorola has done a good job with MOTO G and Men and Flipkart hats off to your service for such a good response and fast delivery..... Thank you Flipkart os

 Working a 10 hour Shift Mob on a freshness salary I research the products I buy before I do get them
 Most of the Review I read told me that the Shone display is not so Great or that the battery wont last long and that the phone over heat !
 Phone's display is amazing
 You wont even notice the drop in fixed density !
 The 5 inch screen is really good
 I cannot boast about the phone have owned over the days but from the Experience that I have using phone that belong to my friends , I can tell you that Of you are looking for a phone below 15,000.
 To for the and Men Moto G !
 I know there is HTC and other phone which are way better but there is something about the Moto G that makes it a dependable phone
 The feeling that you have holding it in your hands Knowing that a fall or a hit wont break it so easily
 Met me break it down in native review language Gros ********************** os The feeling of Holding it in your hand
 os The screen is far better than advertised by the reviewers.
 os Have you tried MACRO Photography using the camera ?
 BRILLIANT !
 4)The speakers are Good os > Not great os > but better than those who complaint Sometimes it good for people to understand that the sound that comes out of those speakers also depend on the file type , the bit rate of what you play
 Also about the speakers , True sterno Nothing compared to HTC) but worth the money !
 os The feel Good factor os Sons ---- os , I wont call it that Things to Improve ************************************************************* os Battery People who just got the phone like me tend to use if for hours on end without giving the phone a break ----> The battery wont last long os > 6 to 7 hours MAX !
 People who have used it for a month now , finally giving the new phone a rest --- > Battery might last a whole day , Of you are at work and rarely get time to play around with the phone When him sure It will last an Entire day .
 Battery Would have been better .
 In a final note I love the phone
 Its everything that I have paid for and more
 Thank you Motorola for this amazing Handset !

 I just got my Moto G and gen phone yesterday from flipkart, and I am loving it
 Met me tell you that I just upgrade from a Bony Os which I have been using for last 3 years
 To my jump was pretty huge
 From Android 2.1 to Kitkat.
 128mb ram to 1GB, and a lot of other features
 I also intend to keep this phone as long as the previous one
 I loved the mitka version and since Moto G would be one of the first phone to get the Android L upgrade coming this months I am more excited
 Display : Screen is amazing
 Pretty clear and resolution is perfect
 Brightness is not a matter of concern
 Performance : Based on one day i would say much but the screen tongue and pp opening has been pretty smooth
 James like Shalt 8 ran quite decently
 If and my Os worked well giving good speed for net usage
 I was happy with it
 touch is also smooth
 Felt no laws yet
 Camera well I lost interest in phone camera some time ago
 It is not that great but not bad took
 The settings look very mediocre, and they could have had more features I guess
 Front camera was quite decent
 I took a few good series with it
 Music The sound is a bit disappointing even with the dual sterno speakers
 The headphones are also very normal and the apiece dont fit well in my ears
 Storage : 16 go internal memory of which 12.79 go is for user
 I have used up 3 go for apes already but another go free is quite good
 Also have a 32 go expandable external sloth
 Battery I charged till 100 and used wife continuously for 14 hours till it drained out completely
 When I started charging again and its taking quite some time
 Well its a new battery took
 But I have o wait before i comment more about battery here
 The charger is a single piece which i didn like unlike the us to micro us connection types
 Doesn come with other accesories like to connection etc like old mobile did but I never used them anyway
 Either did they feel obliged to add in one extra shell
 He have to pay almost k extra for that
 But all in all I am impressed with the phone as I am guessing its performance is in par with some of the higher end honest with double or triple its prices
 Received the phone from Flipkart without much haste in 2 days
 Update after 3 days : ---------------------------- The performance of the phone is just awesome.
 I have been playing games like Shalt 8 for the whole day and it seldom hangs for a moment or show last
 But it does heat up but I think that is to be expected
 But the battery is a great disappointment
 Bandy Rush 'crushes' it in 3-4 hours itself
 With other games like Shalt and Temple Run it does give some more but still you can expect only about 6 hours and around
 Otherwise you get a whole day if you are not so active on the phone with wife
 If drains the battery too.That's a bit of a disappointment in the battery side
 Battery-saver switches off wife on its own
 For a person like me who busy a new phone once in 4-5 years I think battery is a prime criterion
 To taking off a start
 Walls are clear and decent
 Internet is fast
 Screen is smooth

 Ordered it from flipkart on rd of october and received it by th of November
 Everything was fine
 To defects found when I opened the package
 West thing about this phone is that it works without any last
 You can experience heavy games like Graham origins Modern Combat Head Trigger Shalt 8 fetch
 imp front camera is good and the Primary camera is equipped with imp with flash so it gives you a boost in this budget phone
 Also the phone is equipped with Qualcomm quand core processor and you get a internal memory of 16gb ( 5 go shared so that makes it to 11 go approx).
 Round Quality is also nice
 Must buy
 Overall flipkart service always rockies ... keep it up guns

 I am happy with this products
 Battery is GOOD.
 With normal use you will get easily day backup.
 Camera quality is superb as compare to other imp camera
 Touch response and performance is also good
 To lag while playing games and os video
 Round quality is superb
 RAM is showing 850mb, what is the problem Motorola ?
 why 100mb less ?
 It should be 950mb.
 Overall the product is good
 Of you want to buy a product for its quality in this range and do not want to visit the service center after few months then buy Motor
 You will also get the Nexus type feelings in this range

 Were are the first impressions - 1. Screen Vice crisp and vivid
 With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p.
 It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and unable in single hand
 2. Performance Android 4.4.4
 comes pre-installed.
 Lag-free so far
 Guns Riptide os pretty well
 Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400.
 os Officer Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine
 3. Round The front dual speakers are awesome.
 Very nice sound
 4. Camera 8 os main cam & 2 os front
 Very good snap so far both indoors and outdoor
 Not only 20 mind to experiment os 5.
 All quality 2 miss with noise cancellation and a loud speaker
 Feels good
 6. Micro os Clot His is the greatest inclusion
 Moto G sorely missed that
 Good option
 7. its a good deal
 The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses

 I ordered Moto G and generation from my flipkart account with this mail address on must septa
 Not it on 23rd, nice phone i got the black one it looks premium
 Vice to hold in hand
 To lag even on highest game settings
 I tried If 15, All of Duty NFS MW, Real Facing 3 Only con is the battery while writing this review battery drops from 35% to 27% in Os with no pp in background Os am using Greenify).
 His is horrible
 All going good except the battery but just after opening the back cover twice for inserting him & sd cards the backcover become loose
 Now its making terrible that kate noise while holding it in hand
 I called flipkart on 1800####, tell them
 They say its my mistake that i opened it in wrong way
 But ll i am a cadet freak
 I owned etc desire 816, nexus os galaxy s dust galaxy tax os Canvas hd....
 I had two teach blows for reviewing badges & a quite popular YouTube channel
 I checked the undoing many times read manual book only then i have opened the back panel very carefully
 I never expect this from flipkart.
 Highly disappointed

 The first Moto Os phone which was shipped to me had a flaw
 Upon encryption, the apiece would stop working
 I however received a prompt replacement from Flipkart.
 Thank you !!!
 I have been on the replaced device for only 3 days now
 Considering the price I paid for the phone ( INR12,999 ) a quick renown of the few , but significant items
 os All quality 4/5 os Os vs Os reception Ensure if this is the network provides issue
 VoIP apes drops the connection frequently
 Will post an update after extended use
 os Overall feel & build quality : 4/5 os Camera : 4/5 .
 I like the built in HDR features
 You can switch between 16:9 os Megapixels) and 4:3 mode os Megapixels ) os reloaded apply To bloatware that unlike some Organ manufacturers
 os Battery Lasts all day with Os tuned on and occasional iii use os Screen : 4/5 Overall : 4 on 5

 I am using this phone since a months
 I switched from galaxy s which was giving me battery problems and the screen quality seemed to be degrading
 Buy this phone for os 1. Excellent value for money 2. Great build quality 3. Expandable memory with unable internal memory of 12 go is just awesome 4. Last processing - no laws at all even in demanding games 5. Recent camera 6. Recent battery life - i get 3-3.5 hours of on-screen time with 22+ hours on single charge on single sim...almost same as s 6. Vanilla android, minimal bloatware - higher free ram 7. Screen quality - i dont find any significant difference coming from s ( honestly never liked the over saturated colours on s 8. Good sound from front dual speakers 9. Touch response is good Walls short in os 1. 1 go ram is not good enough for multi-tasking..1.5
 go ram at least would have been better
 For edge when running chromic poweramp consistently shuts down 2. Camera could have been better s camera was better 3. Battery non-removable - if your device stops responding u may have a tough time Overall it is a budget phone which will definitely not disappoint
 Take my word I dont miss my galaxy Os after getting this beast
 To get it

 I received the and Men Moto Os
 It was showing some issues with Battery and Charger.
 Charger is he white colored one giving with new MotoG2.
 I had full charged it for more than 8 his continuously and started using over wife
 I haven inserted any SIM in the first day
 After charging I put for idle one night
 Next day when I tried to switch on it it was not turned on
 I got wondered
 Later charged it for 5-10 minutes and i could able to switch-on it
 I found that the battery dried up fully
 I had connected the charger till full charging again and repeated the same case of previous day
 Even in stand by not getting at least 12hrs battery back without running any applications
 The applications were running only the default apes coming with the phone
 Another thing I noticed is charger is getting overheard always
 White colour charger is not unto he expected standards
 Most amazingly I had tried to connect this via USB cable to my laptop.
 While connecting to USB , its universal law that the device getting charged from the desktop/laptop.
 But this device is not charging here also
 Other than I haven fined any issues with the products but remember that I didn install any application or used this much
 3 days I spent to check the charging nature of the device
 Placed a request to replace this but flipkart customer service is also not feels good
 hey have tried me twice in the contact number and the connection was not good from their end
 Later no response

 Rose Comfortable in the hand display is clear loud speakers
 Native Android OS 4.4.4
 without too many extra like in some other phone as micromax.
 Moto Assist is nice built pp that can be helpful in automatically changing the setting from ring to silent depending on your callender
 Sons Camera APP is not comfortable to use
 I had to download Google Camera but that hangs sometimes
 The built smaller is not user friendly and you might need to download a smaller pp that suits you
 Battery may be an issue if you are continuously on games
 Though after initial first few overnight charge cycle the battery run longer
 Touch Sensitivity on phone for most part is good but sometimes it seems to think I have tapped the phone rather slide it
 I would still give this phone a 4 Eating as some of the sons may be removed when OS is upgrade to Android Os

 Namaskara to all I am using mobile since 15 days now , you guns know about the good features of moto g , i will say negative of moto g , cos when i was buying i used to see about the negative then positive
 os battery will lasts only for 5-6 hours if you use it heavily i mean games wife Bluetooth, live wallpaper, etc etc os all at once else it last for about 17-18 hours may be more if u use it as a basic set
 os charging from 0-100% takes 3-4 hours , this is what is upsetting i think its normal to all moto go but again it not a problems if you are a hardware user
 os Of the moto g heat up using it heavily back of camera will be heated u can feel it the it is not like you can hold it , but you can experience bit of more than normal heat
 os back cover cases is so expensive from moto , hope the piece should be reduced
 os os Flipkart delivered with in 9 hours !
 now that great not a word for flipkart.
 Hope i helped you
 Regards

 Moving it so far... 1. Smooth and responsive
 To problem whatsoever 2. Very good camera for the prices
 Very good quality day shots and good shots in night also
 LED flash is very good
 The camera sometimes hangs and the LED does not go off in which case you have to power off but it is a rare events
 3. Voice quality in recording is hard to believe The earphones provided could have been better and the USB transfer cable which was missing would have made the deal even better but nonetheless overall I am highly satisfied with the product so far...

 no other phone could actually compete with this phone in this price list coming to asks zenfone 5 os 1>asus has brightness level 100 = brightness level 40 of moto go sound from the speakers is very low in case of asks , where as in moto go , it has dual sterno speakers
 in other words moto go is one of the loudest speaker phone in the market
 3>moto always updated to latest andros , cause its a goose company phone .
 you dont have to worry about the ram usage in moto go even though u have only 1 go of ram in it u can play games do multitasking , do what ever u want remember this phone is a goose phone , it is highly safe to move around with your phone than to move with asks phone
 except for the processor speed , u wont see any backing in this phone .
 this is exceptionally a needed phone for all mid range smartphone users that complete my review if u find my review useful please like it

 I just today I got my motor second gen it still looks good Os have been using the original motor the
 biggest shock was the speakers were not good at all tried playing same song in both motor and moto g second genito my surprise the sound quality and the strength go the music was better in the moto g first genu
 flipkart/users please let me know if there is some issue with my hands or this is the problem with all the handsets.
 It is surprising as the second gen comes with two speakers and I read good reviews about it
 Also the charger is like first gen and still there is no USB chord
 Other than that I haven faced any other issue
 the phone size looks great and there is no lag.moto
 migrate rocks..camera picture was also nice and clear...

 First of all thanks to Flipkart.
 Delivery was fast packing was very good and product is in ideal condition
 Deep it up guns os Now coming to the product itself
 I received it yesterday I found this phone to be very good
 All the praises everywhere around about the recurrence of Motorola and the positive reviews were the reasons for me to opt for the and gen Moto G and my budget too :P).
 And I must say even after such huge expectations him not disappointed
 To need for me to delve into the specification as Flipkart has summarise them very well
 Will now I haven found any problems worth writing about
 But there just one problem with Android Mitka its not a con of this phone mind it
 You cannot set the default memory for your bluetooth transfers to your external os cards
 All the files are occupying the internal storage and I canst even move the files later to the external os card (I'm using Androzip file manager
 His is the only con that I found till now
 Everything else is great
 Highly recommended for those who want to buy a smartphone under 15k.

 Flipkart delivery was awesome , got the phone next day itself
 Now coming to the phone
 After using the phone for about a week i must say its a charm...Feels good in hand
 Display is brilliant and plays video with great clarity 1 go ram + Snapdragon processor does not make any kinds of laws least on the basic usage
 I haven tried gaming yet but in sure this phone can handle high end games
 os goose works perfectly Camera is awesome..both front and back camera are good Good internal storage...SD card expandability is also there..SO plenty of memory available
 Latest version of andros 4.4.4
 CONS: Charger is only 550mah so it takes a lot of time to charge..better try other charges
 Seats up a bit sometimes...only sometimes(Usually all andros phone heat up Earphones are just os but not good for listening music..buy a good earphones if u want to enjoy music
 Battery back could have been unto 2500mah but still it works for a day with moderate use
 People dont go crazy over Xiaomi.. Buying that phone itself is so difficult then imagine their after sales service
 Also MOTO has a good brand image and after sales is growing widely in Indian
 His is the best phone to buy if or budget is around 10-15k Motorola has literally killed the market...Keep rocking moto...And ranks to flipkart

 I have installed 173 applications trusted and entrusted but there is no hang problem and not slower yet

 Good camera , Image quality is very high

 I have been using the phone from th September......and I used to like it but after few days (approx.
 3 days)....it began to heat a lot.......first I thought it is due some over usage so I keep on using it......but now this phone is hot for 90% of the time......can't even keep it in my pocket or make calls...... Pros.... 1. Good design.....but could have been better.... 2. Screen size..... 3. Front speaker.....but they are not that loud or clear....... Cons.... 1. Seats a lot.......temperature reaches 70°C.......can't even use it for calling 2. Worst stock launched ever....consumes lot of RAM...... 3. To improvement in processing power.....or RAM..... 4. Now brightness of screen.....not suitable for outside usage......... 5.
 Not dating to latest system update.....i.e.
 Huge 26 based kernel.... 6. Graphics heavy game like Shalt always crashed...... 7. Lag in camera.....after 2-3 pick the camera began to act erratically by going out of focus and response time also decreases drastically..... Will not suggest my family or friend to buy......

 I am using the new Moto G Men 2 since last week and find it quite a smart object at an unfordable price point
 To not expect a sleek metal finished smartphone at this prices
 However the screen resolution at 720p looks pretty dull when I set the brightness to Auto mode
 1080p is required for 5 inch smartphones.
 The standard camera does not allow auto flash or flash function and the option keys are hidden on the right side
 I download the Google Camera pp and now it is working fine
 The phone is nice to hold but after slipping on the protective cover it looks bigger and bulky
 I have also applied a matt finish screen guard which changed to looks of the phone
 Overall the user experience is nice 1 os Am + 16GB internal + 32 os micro makes the phone a small datacenter.
 The best experience of all this is Motorola Migrate pp which allowed me to copy the data of my old phone in a flash

 To start with its an excellent product that makes you to feel pleasant with its presence
 I almost waited for 3-4 weeks for its launch and bought it on the launch day
 Would like to give below review points
 Flush 1. Display size 2. Camera clarity and flash efficiency during night times 3. Speed 4. Built memory size and expandable size Sinus 1.
 I am not sure why am I not eligible for 100% cash back though I bought it on the launch day os 2. Battery life can be bit improved but not a drawback as such
 3.
 To USB cable provided I suggest anyone looking for a mobile in less than ask can consider this without any doubt

 It is a very good phone
 Bandy & fits the hand well
 The option are cool
 The screen resolution is good
 Camera is not excellent but is real good for regular usage
 I found 2 things which are really quite major issues
 One is Battery
 The battery is very weak
 It doesn stay even for 10 hours
 I use what pp and brows more often
 By call duration is also very low
 But still battery doesn last for the time till i go home back by 7 pmb
 Other one is the updated this phone demands
 It consumed huge data from my Os plan
 I dont know whether this is an issue of Android or this phone...
 But it is been a real burden for me to update the apply

 have been using this phone for the last two weeks and here is my review..... 1. Took There is no remarkable change from the previous moto g in overall but the addition of dull speaker in front makes the phone looks like moto e but look more premium
 2. Performance Of u used the moto g st gen then there is no difference in performance since both have same processor and ram but the slight upgrade in the display size (0.5 inch makes the and one better in our experience
 3. Camera Were is the big difference from the first gen.moto.
 the rear cam is equipped with imp autofocus camera but no image stabilizer.
 But moto g 2 takes descent foot in outdoor and good image in low light also
 The front cam is imp cam and it is quite good for video calling but not that good for selfish
 4. Battery Were is the down point of the and gen from the st one
 Of u used the phone with g on and display always on with surging or listening song the battery will last only for 7 his from full charged to hit 5%.
 But it is not that bad because we hardly use phone like that
 But I tested myself to know the performance
 For normal users with some surging listening some songs talking with girlfriend and playing some casual game the battery will last for almost a day
 Due to having bigger screen I expected this from the battery as u know guns 5. Gaming Performance The moto g 2 can also handle all the present os games just like the previous one
 I tested MC4, NFSMW, Shalt os If 14, Head trigger 2 and Nova 3.
 All games run quite smooth without seeing noticeable frame drop
 Due to having sharp and crisp 720p display and deliver descent viewing angle u will find comfortable playing os games in this Shone
 Final verdict Of u r hardware game and camera lover but dont want to burn a hole in or pocket then His device is specially for up
 It is much better than the other mid range phone from Bony Samsung HTC since those phone price will fall nearly on ask with the same specie
 I experience Xiaomi mid myself which deliver premium speck and performance but canst promise the after sale service like OS upgrade repairing etc
 Besides Xaiomi phone have some issues which are so frequent in many of their phone but not all like heating problem losing signal etc

Mr. Debabrata Das
 I am posting this review after using the phone for 11 days
 Had placed order on th Rep in First May Launch Offer and received the order on with was promised In a May delivery Os 90 Extra).
 I am ok with Os 90 extra cost for such an assured delivery in a day
 To as usual Flipkart at its best
 I am a happy & satisfied consumer of Flipkart till date
 Honest Review of the Device A smartphone which has capacity to handle multitasking with nice Camera Round & UI.
 Though there are some sons took
 PROS - 1. Good UI, touch is awesome, better than Samsung Galaxy Grand or Micromax Canvas
 I liked the launched and the bright built wallpapers which is not like cheap androids.
 It has a class
 Your Start 2. Round system is awesome.
 I liked the sound system if you have a headphone with ear-bud.
 The Bass/treble/Vocal/Bass Lunch modes are fabulous
 Give Start 3. Camera is too good with the price range
 I have used Gumma 720/Galaxy Grand compared to these it has advanced features
 Secondary camera can capture nice Selfie.
 Your Start 4. First time user of Mitka version of Android.
 Its a very light OS compared to JB.
 To hang/lag observed during regular operation/accessing internet
 Though I am not crazy for James though basic games Temple Run2, Crazy Grandpa, Nail Rush Shalt Like runs smooth
 Your Start 5. Keyboard is just awesome.
 Mitka OS has some good features Keyboard
 You can just drag the word you want to type it will fetch it automatically
 His feature is best while travelling/walking.
 Give Star.Four Start
 6. Connectivity is good and dont have any problem with it
 Both SIM works perfect together
 Your Start
 7. Speaker output is perfect with two front speakers
 Your Start
 CONS - 1. Battery is average no so good back like Nokia.
 Of you use Wifi/3G for more than two hours a day it drains fast
 Though in Os it gives you good life
 I need to make frequent calls/sms for 8 hours in a day which is not an issue with the device
 Three Start 2. Seats up a little bit while charging but do not pay attention to it
 Its a minimum heat which generate like many other Androids like Samsung/HTC/Micromax/Xolo/Xiomi MI3 etc while charging
 Three Start 3. The Headset which is given inside the Box is very normal and with low quality
 Two Start 4. To Data cable is given inside the box its only a Pocket charge
 Two Start
 Hope the review will be helpful all the buyers who are planning to get it
 I would say os FOR IT, its the BEST ANDROID (Kitkat) PHONE os RANGE os 13K.

 Met me clear that it is not a complaint for Moto G since i am aware of company & its products
 but it is for Flipkart.
 Soto G you have lost your sales in 10's.
 May be it is not much in os but faith is one part where i am falsely committed by your partner
 I have placed my order on th Sep'14 (ODA6829931639PCVNH00) with launch day 6 offers - which was said to be delivered on with os days after ordering
 I followed up again on with for delayed and was replied to deliver again on with (12 days
 which was also false committed
 There was no mail for delay
 Finally i canceled my order where in they are not at all concerned or to apologize
 His may be that they have saved there offer but lost customer May be customer's).
 I am thankful to god that i have not paid for it it was COD).
 But if it would have been paid I would have gone mad for making follow-up with flipkart.

 I registered to buy Xiaomi mid phone but couldn buy due to huge rush
 then motor and gen came i ordered on the launch day itself and now using the phone from past 2 weeks
 Looks wise it is beautiful with curly edges Performance wise awesome , all the apes and games are running smoothly without stitches , no us cable friends , they have given a universal us port so you can connect any us cable
 Battery back is decent
 I charge the battery in morning for 1 and half hour and till coming to home from office at 9 pm the battery still has around 15% remaining , during the day i use g extensively and also play lots of games
 Conclusion In the budget of 10k-14k, this phone really stands not

 Motorola ( with the help of Google ) has come out with this gem and with all the good features this phone is destined to make big .
 I bought this phone as I lost my Os ( yeah os lost !!! ) and boy , this has been a good decision .
 With 5 inch os display , dual front speakers and KITKAT on the go there is no reason to be disappointed .
 To add deserts , Flipkart guaranteed delivery and screen guard would make you make feel sweet .
 And yes its all for 12999/- ( ask - 1 , another way of seeing this ) .
 People complaining about RAM being just 1 os or battery being just around 2000 may should please consider " ab bache i japan love ka os " .
 Google L will coming for this device and battery lasts as most other smart phone boats of .
 To for it guns os

 the title of moto g and gen is perfect.because
 u can hardly find such a phone at this price.flipkartu
 are excellent in delivering the products
 ordered this phone on with see and got it on 17th.
 let me say about the phone.as
 i have said this is a perfect pain wool item
 wont feel that or money has been wasted
 it runs on quardcore 1.2 the snapdragon 400 processor with aren 305 so
 speed is awesome.the
 display and camera is superb.the
 most advantage of this phone is that we can play games like nos most wanted shalt 8 without any lag and senior problems
 i have played both the game on this phone and dint find any trouble
 something what disappointed me is,sometimes it shows restriction access changed".i
 searched for this on internet and found that it is due to network problem.and if u have cut your mind him to micro
 so take a look towards this
 all other thing about this phone is excellent
 think the newly announced peri e may give a good competition to this as the latter runs on same configuration with additional g facility.but
 our moto g doesn have g facility
 if you can adjust these i would recommend you to buy this phone

surendra prasad
 I have both moto g st gen and and genu I bought this for my sister and I personally think the st gen moto is better
 the only thing that better in the and gen is the camera and that it
 prose good camera
 the pictures come out great (8mp) in low light conditions
 the secondary camera (2mp) is also good for taking selfish
 2.5 inch screen but the pp is not so good when compared moto g st genu
 supports memory cards
 cost 1. the display is on the warmer side and it has low contrast
 the st gen has excellent display with great colour reproduction
 the speaker volume is less compared to the st genu it has front facing two speakers but they agent as good as st genu

 Ordered on the launch day idea th Sept.(12:04 a.m.), received on th Kept about 11:30 a.m.) idea 1 day before the expected date
 SATISFIED with the delivery
 But the offers that were for the launch day buyers were actually ridiculous
 Not of much work for majority
 Anyway...that's not important
 Gets come to the phone performance 1. Camera 8/10 Very good picture & video quality good slow motion video recording flash also good
 Now light photos are equally good for the flash
 photos and video can be made in full dark also
 use the flash as a torch also using download torch pp or cleanmaster apply widget.
 Front camera is also very good
 But after booming not that much picture clarity
 2. Display 9/10 os inch screen very attractive and display quality also good
 Gorilla glass protection helps very much
 screen protector is not must for that
 The screen guard provided was not set good
 very bad 3. Same 8/10 Very game I tried works quite good
 games like ta vice city if 14, max payne shalt 8 etc But Graphics can be set maximum to 60-65% range for lawless performance
 Otherwise the game can be played for lag checked only for ta vice city
 But its not that much problem as unto 60-65% range the graphics quality is good enough
 and the fifa14 stopped several times after tapping tap to continued
 I had to reinstate it once and the next time it got fixed automatically 4. RAM- 10/10 To LAGS normally
 5. Looks 10/10 Very good looking phone
 REALLY! both from front and backside.
 6. Round 7/10 Good sound quality
 call sound is also very loud
 But in some cases for specific songs or games its not that much loud
 but OK. earphone doesn go with the phone itself but OK. 7. Network 9/10 To network problem till now
 Used Vodafone and Airtel.
 Both Hittel and Vodafone Os worked well
 8. Battery 5/10 For normal usage like a bit gazing some camera use calls sums some gas it will give 8-10 hours back up with auto brightness on while not using the phone I think
 But if you use continuously I think it will not give you more than 2-3 hours backup.
 I checked for full brightness and much camera use and gaming that it reduce the battery very quickly
 Not tried the internet conductivity that much till now
 Have ordered a power bank worth Os
 749! N.B.: The charger I received worked for one day only and then stopped working
 does not charge
 totally useless
 But for me its just nothing problematical because I have same charges from before as its a very common charge
 For most people it wont be a problems
 But those who doesn have those from before they'll definitely face problems and will have o buy a charge
 But I think its a special case that the charger didn work
 still work for most of the others I think
 In all its a good impressive product and keeping aside the battery issue its a good buy in this range
 Recommended 7/10 Happy Shopping :-)

Amber Kamboj
 Well there are many reviews already on this phone os i would like all to know about all bad of this phone P.S I own this phone for about 8 days and i absolutely love it os i have no entrance towards this
 To Sons are 1:- BACK COVER People say it have a rubberised finish but i didn found it like this os its really smooth plastic and slip a bit but
 official lip covers have good variety and have good grip with back covers 2. DESIGN I found the design to be bit confusing because while using phone something i end up holding it upside down
 i believe there should be some log on the front up side took
 3. BATTERY 2070mah .
 That might average while seeing in number but let me tell you battery back is quite amazing .
 you wont have any issues regarding the battery back .
 believe me .
 only bad thing about battery is that it takes way too much time to charge ..(idk the exact time but its little higher than samson mobile of this battery capacity 4. CHARGER Yes
 It do get hot after using .
 maybe charger is manufactured to work for foreign country plugs and that why it gets heated here in India ( co they have added an extra plug on top of the charge 5. os USB CABLE.
 hats quite annoying co you have to remove back cover always and use a card reader >:O.
 6. CAMERA.
 Quality of camera is superb os It shoots amazing pick but the interface you see on the camera is 6 os .
 if you change it to 8 MP, then dont get full interface of the screen while taking pick but
 that really doesn matter and doesn effect resolution and clearity).
 7. SPEAKERZZZZZZ Well His is one of the biggest issue with this phone os phone is not at all loud enough so that you can hear os will watching an couture video in your room with your ceiling fan on , you wont hear even a single word .
 8. HEADPHONES.
 Headphones provided with set are really annoying to ears as they are also not so loud + they really hurt after about 30 min of use .
 (BUT if you use any other headphones like philip , bl or samson ; they work really nice and very loud
 One More Thing os I own an White coloured phone which looks way much better than black one .
 but white colour is more prone to stuffs like dust , ball pen ink etc but dont worry they get easily removed on hard rubbing os I would recommend to buy black phone if you are not much interested in showing off but let me tell you .
 The kind of look you get while holding a white phone is amazing .
 I Believe black phone only suits with companies like Phone co they got glassy back panel
 And It Last , i found the lip covers and back covers to be very expensive .
 1700 and 800 respectively Review Hated 18-Sep-14)

 18/9/14 Touch Touchscreen is not working properly
 I have to press four five times
 It doesn get registered sometimes I feel I am moving my finger on just plain glass
 By piece has a bad touch response
 Want even use the phone
 Camera Camera has issues
 Of you keep flash on/auto and click pictures of very closely objects like 5 cm or 10 cm close the flash doesn turn off
 You have to start the phone and start camera pp to turn off the flash
 I dont believe camera issue is hardware one an update might fix it no updated yet
 But still its annoying
 Didn face any heating while using yet
 Charger gets hot but not that you can hold it in your hand
 But it takes time to charge
 os cards os card gets disconnected when phone is on or even sometimes doesn detect os cards
 I had inquired on phone about the phone having issues while the phone was still being shipped
 I saw 4-5 continuous reviews where people faced problems
 I asked the sales representative about the phone as many people had received defective pieces whether the batch they received was good or not
 They told me that the product is good no problems are there
 Requesting for replacement
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19/9/14 12.51 pm Flipkart representatives called me regarding the return request
 They told me to do a factory rest
 I did that put all the details email id etc
 Still touch is having problems and os card is getting unmounted.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19/9/2014 4.05 pm By phone is dead now within 24 his without using
 Not starting at all
 I might have used it for only 2 hours from the usage states in phone
 I didn have a micro him so couldn use call functions
 Touch was defective and os card was getting unmounted.
 And now its dead
 Highly disappointed with Motorola.
 They should least give better phone than Micromax, or Chinese Honest
 wont dump phone which were rejected by EU/US standards in Indian
 Flipkart should stop selling Moto G and gen for sometimes until Motorola realizes its mistaken
 Please new buyers dont buy this phone until Motorola improves the products
 Any products are defective
 Wait if you want to buy Moto G and genu
 To for Android one if urgent
 When you can change over after sometimes

 Rose > Very good phone
 > Handling is Good
 > Camera is awesome, try with Google Camera
 > Round is good but it could have been better
 Sons > Battery drains very fast I think its because of screen size and low rating battery

 The product is really good
 Os mentioned hats off to flipkarts delivery system
 I got the product within a day of ordering
 Now coming to the Shone itself Motorola has done quite a few major changes that has brought this product in par with all the other competitive phone like Us Zenfone and Xiaomi Mi3.
 Rose 1. Brilliant Display seems Morning Gorilla Glass has done wonders to the screen instead of the display density being a bit less than previous Moto Os 2. Gaming performance is also good
 James like Shalt 8 and FIFA 14 run flawlessly.
 3. Battery back is average
 4. The sterno speaker is really impressive as the speaker are at the front so while holding the phone the sound doesn get blocked
 Sons 1.
 While playing games the phone does tend to get heated up a bit 2. Sometimes there is a burning smell of some sort from the earphone jack while using the phone a bit
 I hope flipkart sorts out this issue a replace this model
 3. I hoped Motorola to give 2 go ram in this set
 But go is sort of ok is used to a limit
 To according to me this phone is quite good for those who wants just the right level of performance and speed

 I have orders Moto G 2 and Men on launching day
 Received quick delivery from flipkart 5 star rating for it .
 I think Motorola in an American but I disappointed to see chinese manufacturing.after 10 day experience I am giving review as under
 Rose Screen is smooth and crisp
 Right weight and comfortable in pocket 5 inch display how ever compact in size easy to hold in hand
 Grip is best
 Took wise beautiful then other brand Moto assist is good apply
 Sons Camera both is good not best , Picture quality in room is worst
 There is no USB data cable
 RAM is 1 os like Moto E why we should spent doublemoney just for front cam & slight more big display ?
 Internal Memory of moto E also expendable.
 To file manager provided so I can not found to send voice clip or song by Bluetooth.
 Connectivity is major problem.can
 not catch weak tower , while my other Samsung and Enter hands dont loose tower of same service provider (BSNL) so using net is being headache sometimes
 Os phone is made in China there is no difference in configuration with Xiaomy or Gionie etc
 To regional language except Mind is supported so can not read this language in for webster etc
 His type of problem is not in Samsung.
 Headphone is worst and China brand.charger is OK.
 In short if you want to by Moto then Moto E is worth for money then Moto G just double prices

 Moto Os is great smartphone in the budget no doubt But after using it for 5 to 6 days my experience is...... Rose 1.
 It looks dam premium in hands 2. The screen response and viewing angles are awesome 3. Run totally Lag Free 4. Sure Android experience with guaranteed future updated Sons 1. it heat when you run games and some big applications 2. Battery back is below average Of you use Os continue then it gives back for 7-8 his on Os 5-6 his only on WIFI its slight better but not as expected from Motorola 3. Ratification light is not bright enough Last Words To for it if you want pure andros experience in unfordable price and you are ready to compromise battery life and normal heat up

 i got this phone from lip part MRP is 13099 and i got it at 12999....at this price the specification this phone is having is very much sufficient for normal purpose use as mobile as gaming and data internet
 what i likes in this phone ....? i like all the things except battery should have been at least 2500mAH...because for good/heavy user they will need charge of battery after 6-7hrs.
 i tried iii on , keep downloading data within 5:30 to 6:00 his battery fully drained from 100% to 3%.
 camera quality is good both front and back type works very good i recommend this phone for the people who not heavy users of mobile

 The phone is fantastic and for the price that you pay it is worth every penny
 I have reduced 1 star since I am unable to listen to music on my car sterno through the Aux input - I used to do this with my earlier phone with no problem whatsoever
 However the phone speakers are loud enough to listen to music in the car with reasonable clarity I can listen to music by plugging in a headset, so the 3.5mm input itself works fine
 I am now forced to purchase a Bluetooth car hands free set separately in order to listen to music
 Hopefully that will work
 Based on what I have read online this problem seems to be a common feature on earlier Moto G and X phone as well

 I immediately called flipkart only to be told that I would get a call in 3 working days and would be guided on how to "troubleshoot".
 To I pay ask front to Flipkart and get shipped a defective phone and then have to wait 3 days for someone to call me and tell me how to fix a defective piece

 os Everyone here telling flipkart service is good
 But i am not happy with flipkart delivery speed because it is average like other online retailer
 2)About the phone - os display is good feels comfortable during long usage and high definition video
 os Shone is crisp and can be easily handled with single hand because the back side mat finish is pretty cool os Round quality of the speakers are amazing no words its just rocking 5)LED modifications lights are not up to the mark os Him slot is not complying with all him cards
 Any times it gives problems & its very hard os Battery back is not good for heavy usage.But if you are a ave phone user then its ok os When taking images that have good and punch colours but the details are missing even in 8MP and little problem is the presence of noise in close-up shot and Indoor pictures
 os Not is not provided USB cable 10) Touch experience and speed is ave

 Must got this phone yesterday and i have been continuously using it since then
 ->I'll rate it 3/5 for front looks like any ordinary micromax!
 but the back side mat finish is pretty cool
 ->Sound is pretty great with the dual speakers
 ->SPEED os LOVELY, specially if you are a heavy multi-tasker its a go ->Lag free performance even in high graphics games(asphalt os so if you are a gaming freak but cannot go for the ask segment its the best os ->Display is good feels comfortable during long usage and high definition video
 ->Cameras are great The worst thing about the phone is the battery back up
 Battery drains like anything
 To if your usage is mostly at the places where you dont find charging ports you should have a second thought
 Overall a brilliant phone
 It this price what more could one ask for Os os FOR os os

 Firstly i will thanks to flipkart team for quick delivery Moto Os is a excellent phone in this price range
 Battery back is quite oka
 In normal use battery discharge only 50% in 12-13 he
 In gaming,internet surging it discharge unto 80% in 6-7 his
 Shone can play full os video asphalt8, subways suffer etc with no lag or hang
 Its a pure andros phone which better its performance as compare to others having same configuration
 It has Gorilla Glass 3 & scratch less back cover which is not present in some high budget phone eg:Samsung grand worth 19K.
 A value for money phone
 but one thing in suggesting to flipkart that the lip covers and back cover price is too high please provide some offers to it os love you flipkart!!!

 I am using this phone since a week now
 Its a very good phone as i own it but...
 I would talk regarding the bones 1. Battery 2070 may is a very big mistake with a 5 inch display
 With wife on casual chatting n facebooking it lasts just 10hrs.
 2. Charger is too slow takes approve 2.5 to 3 he to charge from 15% to 100%.
 3. Sterno Round ah aunt that impressive nor are its plastic made handsfree.
 4. Had core 1.2 The processor its takes 1-2 see to open whatsapp's certain conversation and unloading 10 images at a time gives a black out of 2 sect
 apart from whatsapp its smooth
 5. 1 os RAM sounds a bit less for the price tag it has got ASUS gives more
 Of you dont have any problem with the above things To for it os

 Display is awesome,viewing angel is also very good.color
 reproduction is good also
 Round quality with dual speaker is very good and clear.call
 quality is awesome.
 Camera is good in both lightning Conditions.pics are very clear just let the camera st focus properly
 Design is good
 I am very basic user so battery lasts for 1 1/2 days feel the battery will last 4 to 5 his with heavy and continuous use
 Of you are a basic user then follow the steps to improve battery performance off auto son off iii network and data connection when you dont need them 3-GPS system off(location service
 house minimumbrightnesss/auto brightness screen timeout 15sec/30sec Performance of phone is lag free and very fast
 Recommends dont use unnecessary background apply
 I bought it only for its brand .
 I hope it will last long
 I could buy Micromax but I felt , that is excellent only in speck not in quality
 Generally these grands products are less time span compared to other good brand like Nokia,moto,apple.
 Generally its a pain to run service center
 Everything is good except battery but it will improve just after the Android L updated
 To buy it nothing could be better than this on today date.......
 After 2-3 day use of its headphone i got the quality sound which i feel Letter then my nikita wh 208

 him a heavy duty user of smartphone features and i found the moto go gen 2 to be an excellent buy for the price ; Avert - i have only been using it for 3 days so far but i have noticed the following : Smooth performance good handling the touch interface is fruitless and has all the features that one needs...
 The one challenge i have faced is that the battery takes far too long to charge
 It took over 3.5 hours to go from 30% to 100%, and also the charger that comes with the kit heat up quite a bit during the charging process
 I hope that this issue is fixed in future patches

 I ordered the Moto Os on th september..and got it delivered on Sunday th september afternoon..But unfortunately I got a defective handset, the phone LED Clash want working
 Launched a complaint..and got it replaced by Thursday with September
 Oats off to the Flipkart Delivery system because getting your product replaced is not so easy through online platforms
 Anyways.
 about the phone PROS : 1. Excellent display - The screen is crisp and all colours look lively
 You wont complain about the screen at all 2. The Sterno Speakers - Great sound quality better than the earlier genu of Moto Os you would definitely enjoy playing games and watching video
 3. The Camera - Good camera fast focusing, great flash
 Overall the camera is really good at this price point
 4. Plates - Motorola has already confirmed that this phone would get the Android L updated so chill :'D 5. Build Quality - The curved back gives an awesome feel to your hands and makes it easy for you to hold
 6. Battery - I basically used my phone for browsing (45 mind James (20 mind Watching video (20 mind social essaying (25 mind and listening to music for 2 hrs..And surprisingly I got battery back of 20hr+..So its great at least for me
 CONS: 1.
 The camera could have been better in terms of sharpness
 But it wont be a deal breakers for you
 2. The RAM and Processor can be a problem for some of the people It the end I would suggest you guns to buy this phone if want a nice stylish phone at this price + a branded and reliable company like Motorola.
 To just os FOR IT!

 I have ordered two mobile and found flash functionality issue in both the honest

 To switch off the flash need to start the mobile and open the camera pp
 To issues when flash is set to off
 All buyers please do verify your mobile as this issue has been spotted in all the mobile which me n my friends had bought
 Cry doing this to verify whether your mobile has this problem or not > Met your camera flash to os or AUTO mode
 > Cry to place some piece of paper which had some text in it and put the paper very close to camera
 very little gap between or phone and the paper > Cry taking the pick or try to autofocus.
 Were the actually issue starts the mobile tries to focus the text but the flash goes to a hung states
 Meanwhile you can even use or mobile but flash will be glowing all the time
 To switch off the flash need to start the mobile and open the camera pp
 Os i have found this issue in all the devices which me n my friends bought it might be the issue with the hardware
 Part from this issue everything works flawlessly.
 Raised a complaint to Flipkart and asked us to wait till we get a call from technical team
 Cried calling multiple times to call center they need 24 business hours 3 days ) to just know the details about the issue
 God knows when do they really start knowing about the issue and start working on it os

 His cell phone has all features in a upper lower range phone section

 It has two speakers but i dont feel that is that much effective
 Note The one i got in that i had a problem like some thick thick noise was coming during ring and talk in some seconds of time interval and it was continuous
 To i requested Flipkart to exchange this piece with a good one
 Still this exchange process in progress

 I was a regular buyer of Flipkart since last 2 years but services of Flipkart is getting deteriorating day by day
 I Ordered Moto G Men 2 in the midnight of th Kept and product was received at Endure Sub on th Kept but since th their logistics partner E-kart commit us to deliver this product by the day end and then no attempt is made
 Even regularly I am following up with their so called customer care department and those stupid people are so careless that they are not able resolve the issues and just exchanging mails with corn content with no intention of customer satisfaction
 Today I canceled my order and decided to not to use Flipkart in future
 Flipkart should understand that if they will not care for customers customers will not take time to forget them
}
{
M. Radhakrishnan
 Delivered the Moto G and Men on th day of ordering
 Excellent phone and performance
 Vice pictures and excellent sound quality
 Sons Flipkart should have started selling Lip covers for the new Moto Os Presently Flipcovers for new Moto G and are not available in the shops took
 Further there is no USB cable and Screen Guard included in the Back
 Also wanted to know if there is any Motorola conductivity software connecting and transferring files Pics, SMS, etc between os and phone

 I really loved previous model of Moto go
 But I was really hesitating to buy this phone as this didn had 5’’ screen and os card support
 Now second generation have both these features
 I am really happy with this phone
 Fig screen with bit small numbers of DPI doesn others me
 Screen is crisp clear and perfect
 After all what do you expect from brand like Motorola in 13k.
 Only one thing missing in this phone is gyroscope sensory

 Ordered 2 days before and received Yesterday
 Fantastic delivery
 Couldn't keep up with the tracker's speed os I am using this product since yesterday I received and I charged my mobile yesterday in the evening still 62% battery is there
 I am using the net on wife mode listening music receiving calls Whatsapp, playing Subways suffers
 Now I can say that the battery back is excellent
 Even the Charger is not heating while charging
 To guns who charger is getting heat up while charging kindly get it change from flipkart.
 Camera performance is much much better than the old Moto Os
 While Playing games it never hangs so I can say the processor is also good as compare to all the samson phone having 1 os or Am in that it hangs while playing game
 I even played shalt 8.0 and it is working great
 Regarding the look and feel I can keep myself away
 I just love holding on my hand its very light
 Of you come to the screen resolution you cannot say that its 720P or 1080P until you go through the Specification
 The content is sharp and clear
 The sound is very loud and clear even while attending a call or making a call there is no noise disturbance the word spoken is very clear to me as well as to the receiver
 Even the headphone sound is very loud and clear
 While talking I didn find any network drop
 Last but not the least Apple user dont waste your money on such product whose cost is 6 times more and giving 2012 specification

Aurko Chatterjee
 Since by now everyone knows what speck this phone has I wont pass your time making you read technical stuff
 By hands on experience with the phone 1.
 First Impression is the Last Impression - The speed the hand-feel and the battery touch will make you smile the moment you switch it on
 The big screen is indeed a wonderful update to the good old Moto G st Men 2. Getting you up - His phone configures/personalizes all your stuff within minutes
 Google is indeed based towards its products
 3. Camera - I am a photographer and trust me though people may start comparing this phone with its immediate competitor Micromax Canvas Micro which has a 13 os & 5 os camera I would say dont get wood by megapixels.
 His phone camera has a pretty decent sensory
 4. Memory too less - Os it
 Well technically yes 1 os is definitely not a pro in this multitasking world
 But for users like me out there who love to spend time more on social medial news comical magazines and other similar things this phone will not disappoint you 5. Battery - A small problem indeed since now you have a powerful screen to touch with the same st Men battery
 However with the right apes and usage and I dont mean you wont play games or not brows the internet you can pretty much make it last for 24 odd hours
 6. Storage - Looks pretty decent to me
 I am never going to cross 48 os (16 os + 32 os MicroSD) anyway
 7. Size bulkiness, weight - His is a very light slim and easily-comes-in-the-pocket phone
 I have short fingers so I got to use both hands for operation
 8. EDGE/Wi-Fi - want really update you on 3G, but EDGE and Wi-Fi experience has been good so far
 I got it on th September
 Still a new user and hence will keep sharing my experiences here in the days to come
 However I would strongly suggest you to buy this over any other phone in this range

Akhil Khandelwal
 wont think that this phone canst perform just because it has only a gig of RAM, Moto G and genu ran Modern Combat 4 on amazing graphics without any lag!! him so happy with my choice

 Dear All His is my consecutive second mobile from flipkart after the previous Moto Os First of all thanks to Flipkart and Beams the delivery is the best and incompatible
 Coming to the specification of the Moto G and Generation 1.The box contains accessories like the charger and the headphones not worth it
 Use headphones like Sonya JBL, etc the music is really superb
 The charger is not a USB mounted charge
 To please ensure to have your own USB cable for data transfer
 2.The phone is very slim compared to the earlier Moto G and it is very light in weight when thinking of any other os smartphone.
 3.The looks and design of the phone are worth appreciating
 The Clear Black Body with the Morning Gorilla Glass 3 and the Black Watt finish at the bottom feels to keep it in hand for hours and hours
 The resolution of the screen is HD.
 4.The display of the phone is very crisp and sharp the wide angle display is also good the fixed density is 294 pp
 5.The phone has 2 speakers on the front and the output of the sound is very loud and clear
 The sound is very high when compared to the sound of the previous version of Moto Os 6.And now the most awaited moment for all the Moto G and Generation buyers the Motorola team has come up with a variant launched in Indian having 16gb internal memory and expandable memory slot unto 32 by
 7.The camera quality is way way way way way way .... better than the previous version of the Moto Os
 The 8 up quality is really good in the natural light and above average in the indoors
 The front facing camera is decent with a 2 may
 The video resolution is HD.
 8.The advantage of buying this phone is that the Google has already announced that it would be having the next Android Update of LOLLIPOP, Android L for this phone
 It comes with the Mitka version of 4.4.4 and with no reloaded apes like the other smart phone other than two security applications of Motorola.
 9.
 The processor is an improved version compared to the previous version it comes with a Snapdragon 400 chisel and a quand core 1.2 Ghz.
 The phone does not lag playing the games like shalt os Head Trigger Nova 3 etc
 There is no extreme heating when playing these high graphics games
 The phone gets little warm which normally would happen
 10.It has a led ratification light for all the ratification lovers 11.The disappointment comes when the battery is considered the battery is same 2070 may which should had been at least 2500 to 2700 may
 The only sons of this phone but as far as an andros phone is concerned we all travel with our charges and power banks
 To its not a big concern
 12.All people concerned about the care centers for Motorola, it has got its centers in all most all states Os overall I would concluded the best prices phone for a STOCK Android phone along with the delivery of the Flipkart makes it a SURE SHOT BUY.
 Thank you Google and Motorola.... and Flipkart ...

 - service Flipkart did a good job got the phone in a day
 Thank you
 About the product no specie - speakers They have provided 2 speakers but the sound isn great or twice as loud
 you will have to keep your hands to the side instead of back for better sound
 - battery Battery is him just about oka they should have increased the battery capacity considering its a 5 inch phone
 - screen 5 inch makes sense as it doesn have dedicated buttons and stock andros has the buttons on the screen using some space of its own
 - look and feel great
 feels lighter than older moto go back panel is richer in quality
 overall a pretty good looking device
 hope its as sturdy as appears
 - accessories : headphones/charger.
 for the price they are oka
 - storage and as my title am super happy with the huge storage capacity internal + plus sd - no lag whatsoever also am happy with the boot up time
 - rear camera is good for a mid range mobile phone
 front camera exceeds expectation definitely good for video calls
 final comment super phone

Pradeep Vyas
 very nice smart phone under 14k. 1. Larger screen The new Moto G looks almost the same as the old one but has a slightly bigger screen
 The new model has a display larger than the old model by 0.5 inches but with the same screen resolution
 The inch 720p display on the new Moto G produces good colours and has satisfactory viewing angles
 The larger screen with the same screen resolution means a lower fixed density but practically there is little difference for a naked eye to noticed
 2. Improved camera The Moto G and generation comes with enhanced camera
 The megapixel count on the new Moto G has been upper from 5 megapixel to 8 megapixel for the primary camera and 1.3 to 2 megapixel for the front camera
 I remember telling people in review of the original Moto G earlier this year that the front camera is okay only for video calling but not for selfish
 But now Motorola has filled that gap with the new model
 3. Additional storage A significant improvement in the second-gen Moto G is that it offers expandable storage
 The addition of a micro card slot in the second-gen Moto G indicates that Motorola took the feedback seriously
 The original Moto G was criticized for not offering additional storage
 The company recommends to use a micro card of not more than 32GB.
 4. Dual speakers Unlike the old Moto G that came with a speaker drill at the back the new Moto G has dual speakers at the front that produce fairly loud sound in a normal room environment
 However in a noisy atmosphere it may not sound as powerful
 But with earphones plugged in the phone produces excellent audit results 5. Cheaper Motorola in its new Moto G has upper the speck on many fronts but what it has not increased is its price - in fact the phone gets slightly cheaper
 The new and improved Moto G (16GB) comes at a price of Os 12,999, which is Os 1000 cheaper than its predecessor
 The company has not yet launched the 8GB variant of the new Moto G.)

 A decent phone which tricks all the right boxes I am giving it 5 start because it does which it is suppose to does
 But it does pale in comparison to Xiaomi Mi3, but you need to be very-very lucky to get hands on to In and moreover it is not available right now took
 To if anyone who needs a phone under Rs.15000/- can go for it
 Voice clarity is good while on call speaker voice is good and clear phone is fast and moreover now you can install os card in it took
 But I am still waiting for the launch day offer gift email from flipkart.
 To not know when they will conduct the draw and when I will be able to avail offer of 50% discount of Moto G accessories.

 I All I wanted to quickly call out two of the features that made me buy this phone and after using it i dont feel let down
 The camera is really good for an imp it brightens the area you focus on and the video recording is very crisp
 You will not be disappointed with regard to the camera
 Impressive storage capacity 16gb built-in and i am using a 32gb cards it just seems to feasible i can use it as a storage media and move files since i have extra space
 However i am disappointed that we do not receive a data cable with the phone

 But your coat according to your cloth...but still get more than what you have thought !!!
 When imagination and expectation perfectly matches reality...welcome Moto G2...its a dream come true!!!
 Of smart phone canst offer basic features like wider screen , expandable memory through microSD, os , Sterno speakers , pure Vanilla flavour of Android with smooth battery performance and latest firmware upgrade and still cost up to 30-50k...
 These basic features have become a necessity and not just a luxury or something to just brag about unnecessarily
 But if the same is available at economical price without compromising on the premium finish looks..then u know you have made the right decision
 Father Motorola has made it much simpler by adding more features to Moto G must genu and reducing price of and gen phone by 1000 bucks
 By previous smartfone posted me ask and I retained it for 2 yes 8 months and ever since I bought it I have been using Android 2.3-
 Not a single firmware upgrade I received Which was bad !!! From the past 1 or I have been looking to buy a much matured smartfone and that too @ economical prices
 Finally the wait is over !!! Screen width is better compared to Moto G must genu and matches that of Nexus os Moto Os Samsung Galaxy S4, and Samsung Grande Quos
 To feel good at it
 I wish the in-box accessories also contained a data cable with USB charging adapted instead of just a single piece of charge
 Overall I would say full satisfaction with the product.... 100 out of 100.

 Dear All The phone which i ordered but had to wait for so long almost 3 days to received even though ordered at 12.06 os in midnight but it was worth the wait
 The phone specification given are exactly what being said and it really amazed the way it is
 I wont say the Price is cheaper compared to the quality of the products
 It is reasonably prices with the quality of the phone is
 The Rose os 5 inch Screen which is very easy to handle and it is really needed with today usage of bigger screen also the screen is Morning Gorilla Glass which is essential in today rough treatments with our Phones....lol.. os Bones Camera os os as primary and 2 os as Front for Selfie), it shoots really awesome pick with good resolution of 1280 X 720 and also the Video as well
 Front camera works really great with better and brighter pick
 os Speakers Dual speakers works really great
 The sound is crisp and loud from both the speakers and when used the headset really good and entertaining which will keep you busy listening to music for hours
 os Right Eight of the phone makes it really easy to handle and its really compact and easy to use with one hand operation of course u can play games using one hand but yes
 os Dual Him sloth and very big addition of this phone is its Memory Hard expansion sloth which is like a BOON to these category of models of phone with Premium Grands
 os Letter phone in compact size compared to other 4.7 inch screen phone also against its predecessor models of Moto G and Moto Os
 The Sons os Biggest and Saddest On if i say is its Battery Usage its really a Power Greedy phone The reason power greedy because last night i charged the phone with 80% and went to sleep keeping the phone beside me and in the morning when i woke up and saw the battery level is showed me 10% remaining i slept for almost 6 1/2 hours so you can imagine the consumption of power is made in those unused hours in the night
 os The Headset model provided with the phone are really obsolete ones
 Everybody wants those noise cancellation with ear buds Headsets.
 Its really a cheap move made in Motorola quality well we are even prices likewise anyone can buy a new separate headsets with those noise cancellation ear buds and which will cost you around 1000 bucks well it can be compromised
 os Hmmm....(thinking).........will get back once i find another one...... BUT overall a good phone to buy for those budget conscious people out there
 The wait was worth it and i am really satisfied with the product if i compare it with the price i paid Enjoy the phone....somethings can be compromised as no phone is perfect and every phone has their own drawback but....its good.....

 Device has stopped responding after 2 months
 It went into a boot loops
 There is a solution but the problem shouldn have raised in the first place because I have used the mobile only carefully so much so that I haven even dropped it down even once
 Disappointed
 Editing my rating from 5 to 0. Below was my initial review when I bought it
 I have been using a phone which was coster with less features
 I can certainly feel the difference
 His review is after a days use 1. Looks Stylish
 The front cover ruins the style
 I feel like removing it
 Part from that the finishing is good
 Reasonable weight
 The speaker protrusion look ugly
 Those could have been in the sides
 4.5/5 2. Screen Looks good
 Gorilla alright
 Weather touch sensitive
 Not sure why Google increased half an inch
 I liked Moto G for this
 4.5/5 3. Usability, memory management To problems so far
 With facebook, facebook messenger chromic goose plus hangouts, angry birds etc running I still have 300mb free memory
 4. Audio: Round is good
 Quality not deserving a 5 star rating because I hear some grains
 4.5/5 5. Video Expected Full he video to last
 But they played just fine
 5/5 6. OS: I miss a smaller font and a better resolution
 But a better resolution and a better battery would make it Moto Os Google Now is awesome.
 But have to open it and click the record button to record voice
 But voice recognition is amazing
 To os recording or call recording
 4.3/5 Battery performance Practice every conservation methods like reducing brightness turn off wifi/data when not in use motorola assist and you should be fine for 20-24 hours
 Camera Back cam is superb
 To is the front
 Kisses photo modest
 Packaging: Small neat package
 In earphone, a charger inside
 They could have given a free back cover and a cleaning cloth IMO.
 Altogether Mob well done by Google.

 Its been 3 days with this beauty and seriously guns this phone is awesome.
 I had doubt on its battery performance but even after using for whole day with heavy usage it last for whole day
 Rose Camera Excellent Body build is very good and that two speaker in front gives you a very nice look
 Performance Os there is no change in Processor and ram speed is similar to Moto g .
 His is already trademark as excellent os Display Quality is very good tried watching some os moves and its excellent
 os Hard I have put 32 os card which is 26 os full and thought that performance will be reduced but it is running very smooth
 Sons Built headphone is not up to the mark
 Motorola should work on its accessories.
 Overall its a very very good product at this prices
 To for it

 great cells got an early delivery from flipkart as usual
 about the phone huge inch screen looks great even in sunlight difficult to hold if u have small hands Os difficult to navigable great touch screen very sensitive crisp colors
 built quality is great ...... sturdy slim button position is nice but difficult to press power button and volume rocket as keys are too thin and hard i think it will improve over time after spending some time with it
 sound from 2 front sterno speakers is decent tried on he couture video headphones sound is nice for those who love clear and loud sound tried on bone oe can be improved by adding some good music players for bass lovers os is nice clean and fast gives u a complete nexus experience stock headphones and charger are not good charger is of just 550mah so takes time to charge battery life is good worked for 1.5 day with mixed usage
 no us cable provided so u need to buy 1 rear cam is nice but front cam didn impress me after using nexus
 fast to respond for goose now service(needs to be added externally hope this review helps

 I ordered this product on the launch day and got it the other day
 Though I paid 90 bucks extra but it was worth it
 Flipkart you guns rock really
 Coming on the products After using it for 3 days I can say that you wont get better phone with a brand name and quality within this price range or even 4-5k more than this prices
 The camera is awesome, display is crisp with no pixelation even when you put your eyes nearer to the screen
 Front speakers are just excellent To heating problems no lagging nice hold and design
 Become a fan of Motor
 Welcome back

 His is a very nice phone to use
 Some of its main advantages are os The phone is really good and looks decent enough
 os It is fast for the hardware used in the phone created to the stock andros os It is very light weight and handy and the back panel is really really good
 os The back Panel is so good that you dont want to keep it down
 os The screen is bright enough and the picture quality and sound quality is very decent The drawback with this phone are os Door battery back os Stock accessories supplied with the phone
 os The earphones are normal earphones and are not comfortable to use
 os The charger is useless
 It short circulated my entire house when I plugged it in for the first time because it was too lose to fit in a normal sized power socket
 os Next it is extremely slow to charge the phone took nearly 6 hours to completely charge it from 11%. os Finally dont touch the charger after charging for 2 hours or so
 You might burn your fingers its that hot

 Good awesome phone but I like to highlight the negative points only 1. Internal memory was mentioned as 16 os but when I checked it is 11.9 os out of 12.7 os 2. When I start using internet for 1 Or I can feel the heat produced by the Shone bit worried about it
 West of all the phone is good

 Hello guns Not my motor and Men Shone a bit disappointed with delivery service provided by flipkart as the delivery person was not aware of the address and had asked me to go to him and collect the phone
 Coming to the Shone Were are the pro 1)The best best phone when it comes to performance works like butter already download 7GB of games on the phone but still works as fast as lighting
 To plugging while playing games like Shalt os Real Racing3, Robocop, Iron An os Front line 2. 2)The rear camera is cool captures the detailing with the focus option front is great for selfless.
 os Round quality is awesome with its full sterno sound feels great while playing games and watching video with out the head bones
 os Display quality having a inch display gives you more detailing with the video and games with a sharp display
 Sons There are no sons in the Shone but in the accessories.
 os The head one could have been a bit better
 os The charger heat up very fast while charging the phone
 By rating will be 5 for 5 .
 Us this Shone is a value for money buy it before the stocks are out.;)

 I was obsessed to buy this phone not this one but the old moto Os
 When I went to buy it it was out of stock then I heard and gen is coming Looked it on the th at midnight and got delivered on th due to holidays and the craphole am living in
 Great effort from flipkart, and about phone,..
 You wont get a descent phone with all these features from a reliable company at this rate MOTO is a trust
 Hats what it makes different from other chinese or Indian manufactures
 Shone is excellent
 5'' display above the 4.5'' of moto go slightly lower pp
 but u wont recognize with or naked eyes
 CRISP, SHARP and Brat but not oversaturated.. Premium but
 Think and u have to hold it in or hand to feel it just awesome.. 2 Sterno speakers out in front provides cristal clear sound without any distortion at max volume Attention Rubbing look
 seriously
 Especially the black one
 The only problem was I felt was The Charger provided in the pack is cap
 earphone is OK, but not in-ear.
 Battery back is kind of lower but lasts a day for me without any problem in normal usage CAM is okay imp cam provides descent clarity images..which also supports panorama HDR, and 1080p video and slowmotion..
 I recommend this phone for everyone who need a budget phone from a great company Wont go for the chinese over this they wont last long and u will regret later happened to me

 I had purchased Us Zenfone 5 few days back and I used it for 5 days
 I liked the mobile but suddenly one day the speakers stopped working and I had to return the products
 Flipkart has refused me the entire amount
 But my misfortune that particular model is out of stock in Flipkart.
 To I waited for almost one week and Moto G and Men launched on the last Saturday
 Without any doubt I ordered it on the first day and as always Flipkart delivered it to me within no time
 To regarding the service of Flipkart, its always 5/5.
 Now coming back to Moto Os awesome phone
 The first look itself is stunning great finish and very much handy
 Although the screen size is 5 inch it doesn feel big on your hands
 The build quality is excellent
 The looks are better than Us Zenfone 5.
 Os of now I have installed most of the apes that I use frequently and the phone is not lagging
 The screen is ultra clear
 The camera is good
 8MP is providing a good clarity and even the front cam took
 The battery back up is pretty good
 Fact the battery back is far better than Us Zenfone 5.
 The front speakers are a great advantage on the new Moto Os Its loud and clear
 The signal strength and wife capturing is better compared to Zenfone 5.
 To I dont regret now
 Moto G and Men is far better than Us Zenfone 5.
 Although the Us UI is better
 But Moto G is already updated to latest KitKat version
 (preinstalled) The dual him functionality is good and the micro sd card slot is definitely a breakthrough compared to the Moto G st Men Overall I will give 5 out of 5 for the new Moto Os

Saumyadip Das
 His and Generation~Moto G is really a worthy successor of Moto G(old).. with a micro os card sloth beautiful os inch display more fixed density and 8MP camera os Design is also fabulous... Some hours ago I was actually thinking to buy Peri Os ultra or HTC 816,as my references were 1.
 More than os screen 2. Good camera with flash with secondary camera 3. Dual simon 4. Vice touch and os display 5. Durability, good battery back and cutting-edge technology and last but not the least 6. Grand value and good service support Though I intended not to exceed my budget more than 20k, because for me its no use to spend more than ask only over a phone hats why I was in a great dillema..!! Were Moto-G(old) was already a blip-blip sensation to me because of its great performance and pocket-friendly prices but the two main sons were 1.
 To external sd card support 2. Small screen And see in the and generation phone these two drawback have been totally eradicated
 You can never expect this kind of features in this budget actually.... Hence why to wait for
 See me...
 Os soon as I had seen the advertisement I booked it instantly without thinking of a second.... os os CONS: Actually I haven found any bones in the device so far os 1. Camera is good at day time but not so premium at low lights 2. Battery performance is not out of the world 3. The supplied head-phone is a sons typed.. Emma that all Actually there no any defects I have found yet..!!! Indeed the smartphone is Double worthy for the money
 I will say just get it without any hesitation Really its very nice of this prices Anyways, I will keep posting my experience with the device in the coming weeks
 And yeah Flipkart again proved that hers the best.... Have placed the order just yesterday evening and received by am os today
 Imagine..!! Must within 15 his I got my products Really os makes the impossible possible... Amazing..!!! *kudos*

Projjwal Banerjee
 The best mid range andros phone so far
 Os mind also features the same features except an enhanced RAM, but prices above 25K initially where it is 12999 only
 Nothing to say more about its features as already several hundreds of posts are displayed but I would like to comment that if this mobile would have come with a data cable then it could be ultimate
 Otherwise sound movie call voice quality are really fabulous

Aditya Kumar
 Thankyou Flipkart.
 Not it in 3 days only
 Really nice phone better than previous Moto G models
 Awesome graphics resolution is very good
 Last processor
 1 os RAM is sufficient for those who do not believe in many apply but for apes lovers this might be somewhat slow
 In only 13000/- phone is really awesome.
 camera quality is really 8MP.
 very clean and sharp
 Must Buy

Soumyajit Raj Shome
 Simply awesome....what a phone
 I am here to give you my experience of using it...coz I have already tested it in different conditions
 By views are as follows 1. Design Outstanding look..with a sleek back cover and it is easy to hold in both hands one or both
 You must fill that it worth far than its original prices
 I prefer the black one..coz it looks fabulous with such a big screen
 2. Performance Actually I am searching a phone which have the capability of doing multitasking with smoothness and I bet you that till now it has all those which will give you a proper satisfaction
 3. Camera I must say that it is the thing which makes me WONDER..because I heard reviews before I order
 To I knew that it has a very optimized and cool camera with flash
 I found it so easy because you can simply click on anywhere on the screen to capture photo
 I have also testes the it with flash and I saw that it is very good
 4. Round Moto Os has dual speakers in FRONT which will give you a fabulous soothing experience
 While you play any game,videos the sound will not be pampered by your hand 5. Others It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor which give you a agree experience of playing games and doing multitasking.
 I installed Shalt 8 and my experience was superb
 Thank you Flipkart and Motorola for delivering and making me happy

Anshul Jain
 Buds to Flipkart on delivering the phone in 24 hours
 After using phone for couple of days I can say that this is a phone worth buying
 5 inch screen expandable memory dual front speakers 8MP rear camera and 2 os front camera surely put this in one of the top contended in Did range andros phone Market
 The issue which I have experienced so far is with the battery
 It drains out much faster than the previous version and other andros phone in this range
 Of it could have been a bit better this could have been easily a sensation in andros phone market
 The other which I could highlight is it dint come with a data cable but that something I think we can live with
 Overall,If you can live with the battery issue this phone is worth every single penny

 I ordered the phone on the very first day and received it yesterday
 For the first time i got a worst packing from flipkart i.e., a phone packed in a cover
 Which they generally used to pack in a box
 secondly the product i received is a defective one
 The phone dint even switch on
 Highly disappointed in buying phone online especially from flipkart.
 I have never faced any problem from different products brought on flipkart except honest
 I have asked for a replacement and they asked me to wait for a call from customer service department which is not required for a phone that is not switched on
 Now today they have initiated the replacement
 Met us see how the replaced piece will be
 I will give a further update on this after i receive the replacement
 Until then one star for poor packing and faulty phone

aditya peesapati
 previously used Samsung galaxy grand though there were minimal problems I faced with it when I st saw this phone speck I just fixed my mind blandly to go up with this mobile seriously satisfied with the every aspect of mobile felt like there would have been a better battery performance not 2070mah though anything more than that would do the thing actually
 but for the price you pay this is the best product anyone could get..no last no issues and no complaints just go for it in love with android!! thank moto :))

 Google owned Motorola, is the only company which increases the specie yet decreases the price by a thousand rupees.
 Also it is the only company which doesn add lame premises and suffices beside the names of their phone to show the so called update of specs'.
 Rose 1.
 The biggest improvement is the build quality of the phone
 him blown away by the beauty of this inch "smart"phone!
 It looks even better than many of the 20-25k honest which I totally didn expect 2. The battery life amazingly lasts more than a day and a half upon moderate usage 3. The camera is beautiful as well and has lovely settings
 To sons as of now..the phone is just lawless
 which is exactly what we can expect from Google) It is worth every pain which you pay
 wont wait for thirty invites or so called stock of other bands to arrived
 os FOR IT!

 Must got this phone
 First Packaging was good
 Flipkart delivered this phone to me in 3 days
 The Shone looks quite big
 bigger than moto go course it has inch display
 Accessories included Charger And Earphones.
 Earphones looks quite cheap
 The quality of sound is not that good also
 they look like some 300rs cheap earphones Except that the phone looks very stylish and feels very comfortable in hands
 Rose 1.
 It looks very good display is very nice bright and bit high saturated colours looks great
 Video looks amazing
 Os the display is of 5 inches couture video looks great and webster show complete contents you dont have to stroll up and down too much
 2. I have noticed that speakers are quite improved from older moto go voice is very loud and crisp voice doesn get crack even if you play a high pitched noisy video on full volume
 sound is very stable
 3. It comes with 4.4 mitka preinstalled.
 each and every application runs very smoothly even if you have many application running in the background it doesn even show os lag in strolling or running any pp
 I download shalt 8 in this phone and it runs very very smoothly
 4. Camera on this device is of 8 megapixel.
 and secondary camera is of 2 megapixel, i must say both the camera works brilliantly
 Dr mode really works good
 i have made a type call to my friend and outdoing video was really good as my find told
 i have took many series which are quite good looking and doesn show any lack of quality 5. Voice calls were very clear and sharp
 the audit quality was very good and noise reduction works seemlessly.
 The people with whom you are talking to can hear you clearly in a noisy environment
 6. Again the main advantage in this new moto g is sd card support which is amazing
 you can use the whole internal memory of phone for installing games and applications and your video and audit files can be stored in sd card which is course a great advantage
 7. I have charged this phone 4-5 times till now and it doesn get heated up it stays cool even if you play games along with charging
 Although it is not suggested to run heavy applications with charging but who cares old
 CONS: 1.
 It first i would say motorola should consider that the earphones that they are giving with this phone should be good as the headphones are not good and the sound quality of earphones are not good at all 2. Os soon i turned this phone on i have connected the device with my wife to check for software updated n more but whenever i check for updated it says
 Want check for updated right now Cry later I think there must be some server error of anything
 Hats it
 i couldn find anything more as a drawback of a negative point to my experience
 Os i would say the phone is really good
 looks smart stylish with great performance and all the new features
 Motorola guarantees the update of L andros platform which will be released by goose in future

abhishek trivedi
 this is my first review of any phone every
 i will come straight to the point
 if someone want to invest 15000 on a phone and whose parents saying i beta ye ab last phone hi term to by moto g and gen is the best to buy
 how it is best the answer to this is : 1. best built quality you will get in this phone
 2. best andros experience at a very good budget
 3. whatever updated launched it will get it lightning fast
 4. easily understandable
 5. the combination of quadcore 1 go ram and now 720p with 5 inch screen is the best
 6. some people must be wondering of pixelation, but there is no such things
 7. camera quality is LAJAWAB of both front and rear camera
 8. and the best part is easy one hand use
 9. the surround sound gives a better quality to the multimedia experience
 10. last but not the least is a good flipkart delivery service
 so whoever wants to buy a phone under 15000 must buy moto g and genu
 its the best quality phone ever you will get

 I ordered the phone within minutes of it launching at 12:00 os on th Kept and paid for a 1 day delivery
 Received the phone on th Kept as promised
 Great service by Flipkart!!!!! Haven't had a long experimentation with the device however the Shone candles really well
 Primary camera is great intact better than my digital camera
 The phone feels and fits really good in the hands
 It seems lighter than the 149 gas that the speck mention
 I had a little difficulty in removing the back cover for the first time
 Thought it would break if i applied any more strength to it
 However the user manual that came along helped
 In fact they do mention in the manual to be generous in applying a little pressure
 Moto Os uses a micro him so I had to cut my existing mind him in order to use it in the phone
 Overall a great experience so far with the phone and Flipkart.

 Not the order delivered in hours to hyderabad.
 Impressions 1. Performance is pretty good
 2. Sterno sound is a great value
 3. Expansion option is the key missing thing in previous gen which is addressed now
 4. Cried watching a few Google Lay moves the experience is pretty good 5.
 When you keep the iii and Os off the battery is pretty good
 Cried charging 100% yesterday night and kept it aside with iii conductivity on for a good 8 hours the battery went down to 65%.
 Charged it again in the morning and turned off the WiFi, checked that the charge is same after the 30min.
 Of you want to go with standard this is the best in this price range
 Of you are behind UI, this is not your piece but you will definitely loose future OS updated if you dont opt for this Raghu

 EDIT - After about 6-7 months of use I can say that the performance is very good
 But the power button on my unit has become bushy and very hard to press
 Multiple visits to the service centre They were really not good and calls to Motorola and Flipkart were of no use They simply suggested me to visit the service centre again
 him left to live with the fact that the button can fail any time
 Also i feel buying the phone on the launch day was a mistaken since the first phone off the assembly tend to have slight problems which get fixed later
 him left jealous with the quality of my friends Moto Os construction
 Amazing smartphone from Motorola, that too just at 13k! Finally upgrade from my Motorola Defy+, the experience on the Moto G is much more fluid than on my old phone
 Rose 1.
 The screen is sharp and even though it seems huge its pretty compact for its size
 2. Everything runs smoothly and snappily.
 To lag whatsoever so far
 3. The inclusion of a micro card slot was a big plus for me as i could transfer everything without even using Moto Migrate which by itself is a great features
 4. Camera is a 8MP unite but low light photos agent very good
 But hey for this price point its really great 5. Another big plus is the bloat-free KitKat.
 6.
 For those concerned about SAR, the SAR values for this phone are below the os recommendation
 Sons Nothing so far hopefully wont find any
 One thing to mention is non-removable battery but its easy to live with
 To the and gen Moto G tricks all the boxes this time I was really surprised to see the price of this phone

 The phone is really an enhancement to the earlier Moto Os
 I wanted to buy Moto G but was hesitating become it did not have a memory card option
 I am glad I waited and bought this
 His has an expandable storage plus a bigger screen plus a better camera
 The phone looks good so far
 Flipkart as always never disappointing with their products and deliveries.
 Thank you for making the online shopping experience so wonderful

 its a amazing product in this range
 Though there are others products like Micromax.
 color lava n all are available as a competitor of this product but I feel this is best of all
 It has snapdragon 400 quand core processor which separates this out from all other bands
 But there are few things which I didn like personally and I feel I would have done better 1. Battery 2070 may compare to 2000 may battery in moto go 2. Dual speaker : Had idea as it was destroying the look of set
 3. Front camera is 2MP compare to 1.6 os in Moto go
 It could be improved took
 Overall I would say it is a worth buying products
 I am rating it 4/5 become of battery

 -0.5 star for HIGH SAR VALUE -0.5 star for something that makes feel quality downgrade Initially I rate 3 stars now I increased the rating to four stars due to improved battery back after the lollipop updated
 The updated review is at end so please read till end of the review Currently I own a HTC Desire 820 , Nexus os Spice dream Not I have owned Xiaomi Mi3, Galaxy Grand Peri ZL, Gumma 525, Canvas 2 colors Bony LWW n MOTO E.. so I have fair amount of knowledge about these electronic Badges and I am a badges freak..... THIS REVIEW os FOR A NEUTRAL PERSON WHO os CONFUSED FOR WHICH MOBILE os CHOSE in the midrange segment
 PROS: os Its Motorola os Screen is bright and vivid os West stock andros phone under Os 15000 os Camera in daylight os Vice grip os Speakers somewhat CONS: os Camera in night os Speakers give cracking noise at maximum volume level os Requires too much time for charging SCREEN : The screen is pretty nice one
 I like its vividness Seriously my In didn had that colour punchiness that this moto g have.....Also the Us zenfone screen is comparatively less vivid..My friend own it
 To problems with the screen Performance:- CAMERA:- Never expected that quality from a ask phone my canvas 2 colors imp camera was a lot better than this at 8k.. Zenfone 5 has better camera than this one
 The images appear flurry and lost focused
 The mid camera is very good
 GAMING:- His is the place where it hits the sweet spot
 It is ll bit better in gaming than Zenfone 5 but no way it could beat Xiaomi Mi3..
 You can play any high end game on medium graphics setting without a lag but on high graphics setting it will tend to miss a frame or two SPEAKERS AND HEADSET:- These are loud but while listening on the highest level of sound , they seem to be cracking a little bit
 To they are better than the competition at this price but not the best...
 And dont even dare to compare them with HTC's sterno speakers HTC's speakers are way too superior to those Headset output is good but here also nothing beats my HTC Desire 820... Os own a sennheiser , skullcandy than ,Skullcandy Ink'd os I ear phone and Creative up 630 sonya MDR-XB30 ..So I do have a little bit of knowledge and experience..) CALL CLARITY AND "SAR" VALUE:- The call clarity is good but not excellent
 The best call clarity among the mobile I used until now is from HTC Desire 820...
 When I bought the phone the SAR values mentioned on flipkart webster were 0.55 and 1.01 W/Kg at body and head and suddenly after 2-3 days they changed them and increased the values on their product page
 And I was UNABLE os LOCATE THE SAR VALUE os THE BOX os WELL os PRODUCT, WHILE ITS MANDATORY FOR THE MANUFACTURERS os MENTION THE SAR VALUE os PRODUCT ITSELF ACCORDING os INDIAN REGULATIONS..
 I bought that phone for my dad as my dad have strong affection for Motorola...
 I feel that this is a downgrade to previous moto G in terms of the QUALITY.
 By 2-3 friends own gen 1 moto G and boy it feels way too superior to use than this cheap quality products
 I have owned In and now I understood that really XIAOMI is the best in cheaper phones...Mi3 no way feels cheap like this phone
 FIRST TIME BUYERS WILL FIND MOTO G and gen os os os PAR, but ones who have habit of changing mobile like me will find this phone to be costly in terms of what it offers power wise
 It should have been 11999 as compared to the competition
 And result Friends if you want a real smartphone experience then please take a look at os Urea or go for Zenfone 5 so that you will save 3-4k and also will get more value for money
 And lastly if you have a strong affection for stock android, then go with Moto G and genu
 UPDATED 20/02/2015: After the LOLLIPOP UPDATE, the battery seems to be lasting more or should I say far more...
 The entire experience after the update is very very good...
 But as compared to Mi3, its still below part
 But as In sale is over and there is no competition except Zenfone os it seems moto go is the ultimate winner..Currently, I own a HTC Desire 820 and moto go is being used by my dad Now he is satisfied with the mobile after the update... Other than that the phone is smooth as butter Lollipop ruined my nexus 7 but this moto g seems to be a very good handle for the lollipop updated
 To overall I will strongly recommend others to go with moto go ( after lollipop update only if they are looking for proper balance of performance design and software
 I am in love with lollipop... Waiting for it on my HTC desire... Thank You for reading this
 Will update soon as per the experiences

 Disadvantage : 1.) Door Shone with worst speaker during the calls
 2.) battery 3.)battery 4.)battery (MOTO can stop selling this shit ) whether they have brain or not i dont know inch os Screen 1 os RAM Android v4.4.4 (KitKat) OS 1.2 The Qualcomm Had More Processor 8 os Primary Camera and 2 os Secondary Camera 294 pp how these all will satisfies 2070 may ????????????? though you using it or not battery will drain soon

 When you compare both phone Redmi1s has slightly better specification then Moto G plus is almost half of its MRP.
 However why i chose moto g 2 was only because 1)Moto G is owned by Google so software updated are a guarantee the most important point 2)After sales service guarantee Of i buy a red os and if for some reason my phone stops working in 2 months..then Xiaomi which is very very new brand in India will surely have incompetent after sales service similar to Micromax.....as this is India after all and incompetent staff will always postpone things and give excuses whereas Motorola has been in India right since the Black and white phone days

 His phone is worth its prices
 wont compare this with Chinese Mimi shit
 I have used both and am really much more satisfied using moto G then compared to Mimi mind
 By now I haven found any sons in this phone at this prices
 Full os would have been a blessing for this thought
 Flipkart.com
 has discontinued Grip covers for this phone and this is really sad because I wanted to buy it along as I was getting 50% discount of covers
 West everything is good
 Must buy if your budget is under 15K.

 I have multiple issues with my phone as listed below
 These are the observations over the period
 Battery Battery is pathetic
 It doesn last more than 2 hours if the Mobile data is switched on
 For the volume of the calls I Candle the battery ends only half day and I have to continuously keep it for charging
 Very Not Shone is heating up like a hot oven if the call is carried for 5 minutes plus almost burning my ears
 Touch Screen During charging the touch screen does not work
 All other keys open some other application during charging
 Connectivity: The calls gets disconnected abruptly in-between.
 Sometime the other person says he is not able to hear anything
 Speakers The headset is not up to the mark even the loud speakers are very bad
 All quality is not good and cannot hear anything
 Finally I am very dejected with the battery performance
 for the kind of processor speed they have given a absolute useless battery
 I am feeling like a BMW 5 series car fitted with a Ano Engine

 I ordered the phone on th sept received it on th sept at around 3.The phone had no battery and was at os To i get a drained out phone charge it from 320-615 and its 100% I use it till 1220 midnight and the battery is down to 40% with only apes update and migrate,no gaming no camera stuff nothing
 I call the customer care who are quite responsive and I decide to give it another try I charge it in the morning from 620-900 am and I take it with me whole day with no gaming no g or g no wife no calls nothing and till 1 pm it was down to 66% and now at 830 pm it is on 14%.I am surprised about the huge statements made about the battery obviously dont expect 24 hours life but idle state it should last more than this
 I am asking for a replacement
 I am disappointed.My first phone from flipkart and of motorola and I am left unhappy.Lets hope my replacement works fine love the phone so much os

love Jeet
 The overall phone looks and also feels like it is made of good quality substance
 Back panel is real smooth still providing a good grip to the phone
 Therefore one doesn feel it is only a ask phone
 Rose everyone knows
 Personally I feel the best phone with some features which can be corrected
 Sons Am is 1 GB, it may not sound like a con but if you add the used RAM and free RAM the total comes to 852 os which far less than 1GB (1024 MB).
 of which more than 350 os is already occupied RAM so you only get 500 os for your own use I have checked lava iris x Os 7600 phone provides you with 950 os in 1GB of RAM so what happened with Moto Os
 Last time they sold more than a million Moto G so for calculating how many os they are saving by saving just 100 os on one phone
 1000000 x 100 os = 100000 os of money one lake os of money Second things The stroll down of Moto G is like empty
 The most basic thing which one uses is the "profile".
 like the phone sound is on General Silent Meeting Outdoor but it does not have that option neither in the stroll down section nor in the settings
 Normally if you go to the setting os Profile os General Silent Meeting or Outdoor and choose one of them to customize the settings
 But in Moto Os Setting=> Round
 To option for Profile general Silent meeting or outdoor
 Fig problems To the only solution is press the on/off button then change the sound to "silent", vibrated or general but no option to edit these settings
 I am playing Shalt 8 on this phone
 Good but sometimes it clashes
 To not so good
 Therefore overall its a 5 star rating phone comparing the price it is available at
 Only thing they need to do is correct the problems mentioned above

 I was excited to receive my new phone especially as an upgrade from my horribly sluggish and erratic Samsung S-duos.
 The phone itself is a good looking piece
 I was originally not happy with the inch screen having always preferred the smaller sub 4.5inch honest but I quickly started to enjoy the extra screen real estate
 By biggest issue with this phone has been the miserable battery performance
 I gave it a full charge soon as it arrived and that charge lasted about 6 hours of usage
 Anyway I then disabled GPS, reduced screen brightness and now a full overnight charge is lasting me about 7-8 hours at normal usage
 It takes only 3 hours to go from 100% to 50% with usage of go a few phone calls some whatsapp messaging.
 That just cannot work for my lifestyle
 The other issue that I noticed right from day 1 which frightened me is that the touchscreen sometimes does not respond
 Particularly when it is plugged in to charge
 Not just does it not respond but it acts very erratic
 To when it is having such an episode it presses buttons randomly, does not recognize your fingers etc
 I have had this happen about 3-4 times in the first two days though it has not done that again since
 It worries me to have a phone showing such serious issues right in the first week of usage and makes me not trust it as a device that is so important in my life
 I dont know if it is my particular piece that is defective or whether this model itself is a bad choice
 I am returning my phone for these reasons
 8 hours of battery is just not acceptable for a lifestyle on the moved
 Too bad co I was starting to really like the phone

 His phone seemed like a really good buy for the prices and it did function quite well for the first 3 months
 Most that I have been facing what most andros users complain about and that severe last
 Must to clock the phone takes a few seconds and then to open an pp many more seconds
 I know if i maintain control over usage of RAM by apply i should not face this issue but there is too much trouble involved with going to apes and taking their settings
 I got my girlfriend to purchase a Foka Gumma 625 a little before i had purchased this phone and I am pleasantly surprised that with only a 512MB RAM that phone has not hung even a single time
 To if u plan to buy a phone and use it only for around 3-4 months then i would suggest you purchase any andros device
 Else go for windows

 Why there is such a big slash in prices of motorola honest
 I bought Moto X(1st genu last year for Os
 25,999/-; few months later the price directly dropped to 17,999/- By loss 8000/-) I thought it was my bad luck then again I believed flipkart and bought Moto G(2nd genu for Rs.12,999/-; and now few days later the price dropped to 10,999/- With AXIS bank debit cards which I have it is for Os
 9800/- ) By loss 3200/-) I know the price of the phone lashes but I am sure not with this much margins
 Now onwards its os os MOTOROLA from me
 The stars given by me are for the performance of the phone the pricking sucks

 The new Moto Os that I bought from flipkart did not detect any network
 I checked online for reviews and found it was a common problem faced by Moto Os users
 I should have read those reviews earlier...Nevertheless, I took it to the service center where they said the mother board had to be replaced
 Os it was in the warranty period I got the mother board changed but they denied giving me a new handset.
 Of a new unused hands needs the mother board to be replaced then you can guess the quality of the phone
 All the best to all Moto Os buyers

 The battery is really bad
 Doesn't even last a full day and that too with no gaming or calls or messages
 During charging the charger heat up like one has kept it on a gas stove!!!
 And like one of the user has already pointed out - (AND I FACED THE SAME ISSUE TOO) I got a sealed moto go box but upon opening it I was bit shocked to see the plastic sheet of phone screen was bit like forged second hand set kind of work
 There was no motorola's M mark on it plus the sheet was lifted a bit plus their was couple dirt bubbles on the set
 Am also not sure if motorola or flipkart will be sure even about which lot is fresh
 it might be some returned repacked set
 Update to earlier review above - Not the hands replaced on 26/11/14.
 And thankful this time it was a fresh piece
 Aorta watch its battery performance now
 The charger is still heating up thought Update after a week of using the replaced hands - The battery is VERY BAD.
 It doesn even last 24 hrs!!
 His phone deserves a ZERO STAR RATING.

Abhishek Chandak
 I bought this phone keeping in mind the huge success and the lawless experience of the First generation Moto Os but this time Motorola has just spoiled a really great device
 Problems 1.
 The touch sensitivity is very poor and many a times stops working completely and you have to report the phone to get back to normal 2. The phone freeze a lot and performance is baggy and slow 3.
 The dual speakers heat up a lot and you canst touch the earpiece(one of the speakers after playing music out loud for more than 15-20 minutes 4. The RAM is too less and only around 300 os is free at any point which is insufficient for multitasking and apes keep reading Not of other small problems but these are the main ones
 i would strictly recommend against buying this phone
 wont get carried away with your impression of the first gen device as i did
 P.S : I understand that this may be a batch issue in which case Motorola should proactively recall the faulty devices to avoid further losses in customer value

 Two weeks back I bought this mobile and it is not up to the marked

 1. Mobile getting heated like anything while browsing or playing game 2. Battery back up is worst
 Charge getting drained after 5 hours in Os mode
 3.
 Not able to connect Os internet in SIM2 4.
 Even though it has 8MP primary camera picture quality is very poor 5. Mobile is getting hanged while playing games like Bandy Rush Cricket & others pp 6. Mobile charging taking too much of time to complete 100% charge
 I really disappointed with this products
 It is not worthy for the prices

 I liked to new Moto G but the only drawback is the battery it does not give you entire day with Os on
 Moto G should have given at least 2500 may battery capacity
 Also the display should had been 1080p and not 720p resolution
 To overall I would rather go with smother brand then this one

 While the phone is really good to hold works well has fast navigation good sound etc etc but you really canst live with such defects which I faced
 Motorola should pump up its quality function to avoid such issues
 I bought this phone with lot of excitement but was disappointed completely
 Since I got 2 replacement idea
 I used 3 different devices I find it hard to digest this as a one-off cases
 By experience is as follows Not of positive reviews on the Flipkart and numerous media reports strongly recommending MOTO G and Men as one of the best devices in its price range made the purchase decision easy for me
 and Kept | Shone reached us in no time through the one-day delivery option
 with Kept | The phone worked fearlessly for a week before the display cocked off
 Immediately a return/replacement request was filed with Flipkart which was addressed and accepted immediately and the replacement phone reached us the very next day
 The return request was denied at this point in time by Flipkart and I cannot complain as this is mentioned on the Moto G page on the Flipkart site
 th Act | During a weeks usage of this phone I could sense that the screen has yellow tint on the screen
 In fact it was clearly evident when the brightness was set as low
 The screen display quality was really disturbing specially because the phone is known for its display
 Hence I again requested for a replacement/return.
 His was also entertained and accepted immediately
 Plus I was offered to return the phone by the Flipkart executive however I chose to give them another chance hoping that this is a one-off cases
 I asked for a and replacement
 with Act | Since I was travelling I requested Flipkart executive to deliver the and replacement on the 20th. .
 When I got it I noticed the similar issue on the screen of this device as well
 Only difference being that on the previous phone the entire screen was yellow and in the and replacement phone the bottom half of the screen was yellow
 I browed through the net to find that the issue is known and lot of people are facing it
 must Act | I requested for an immediate return and finally pick-up happened on the and and soon after I got the refund as well
 Thanks to Flipkart for the same
 I give a rating of 1 on the scale of 5 to the phone
 However good a phone may be may have the best of specification a single factor can still make it unusable.
 Flipkart gets 4 out of 5.
 You could have got 5 on 5 if you have provisions of entertaining requests on the delivery date and time
 I faced a lot of issues when the and replacement was in transit and I contracted your team through phone/mail multiple times to request for a delivery before a certain day and your team gave nothing but false promises
 I have noticed that you team has no influence over this and product gets delivered only as per the schedule mentioned on the webster
 His is an area where you can improved
}
{
Shaurya gupta
 Spite of the cash back and free data schemes shown i just got only cash back and when contracted the flipkart they said u r entitled to only one
 His is not acceptable as things shown must be delivered else should not be claimed

 Really disappointed by this unprofessionalism.

 His is my real experience that I faced a week back .
 I have got moto go for the first time , and there was heating issue with the phone
 When I use the phone for half an hour continuously it started getting heat
 Of i use whatsup or gazing or internet browsing for more than half an hour , device ll get heat like anything
 That time even I couldn talk over the phone , that much of heat will be there
 I informed to flipkart and got replacement with new moto go
 But unfortunately there was same issue with the new device also .
 Really I frustrated with this moto G2.
 But flipkart service is always good
 I returned the product and also got refund to my account wallet .

 I would suggest people not to buy this phone
 go for another option
 hoping for the reply from flipkart.
 After receiving the product the glass started breaking within 2 days
 To informed this to flipkart.
 But I must salute them for their effort to solve the issue
 They have replaced the Stem within 2 days
 And its a super cool item
 Its a tremendous experience with Flipkart.

 Only size camera price and memory is not important in phone to purchase there are many things need to observed first day of announcement i have purchased 2 phone for me and my friend i was completely disappointed with missing most important future
 1. very very important front camera is there but just waste because VIDEO CALLING os NOT THERE.
 2. In os radio loudspeaker option is not there
 3. Mile manager is not there
 4. while talking in phone you can not connect to Bluetooth headset. 5. Ratification light is there but it will not work while charging
 6. there is no different forts
 7. we can not customize menu icons and u can not move to any pages
 8. DATA CABLE is not given
 9. EAR PHONES is low quality and old model it hurts our ears
 10.
 There are so many option are missing compare to other andros honest
 Finally i spoke to Moto company customer service they model design made as it is and they are helpless to solve this problems
 It is my personal experience with the phone hence i am requiring you people to think and decide before purchasing after looking money dont suffer because already i am suffering with wasting money
 it is only information for those people planning to buy this phone

 The phone is automatically turning off and os on its own frequently

 His was a birthday gift that I bought for my MOM and quite disappointed that it turned out to be a defective one

 Before I start my review let me mention that I have past experience of using Samsung Galaxy More Micromax Canvas 2 and now a days I am using Samsung Galaxy Grand 2. I ordered Moto G and Generation on On th Sep'14 for my wife as her birthday gift on with Seo'14.
 It the time of placing order it showed that faster delivery is not available in Guwahati, so will be delivered by 19th.
 I requested Filpkart to deliver it on or before 18th.
 Thanks to Or Than S from Customer Support of Flipkart who confirmed me that it will be delivered on or before 18th.
 Flipkart kept their promise and Delivery delivered the Moto Os on with Sep'14.
 Any many thanks to Flipkart and Delhivery.
 Now coming to the products Motorola has done a great job
 The build quality is solid
 I felt the premium build quality of Moto Os as soon as I hold it
 The curved design made it one step ahead from the other bands
 Rose 1. Good build 2. Good camera 3. Good battery life Os charged it unto 100% yesterday and still its showing 60%) 4. Voila Glass helps to use it without screen protector 6.
 Great display 7. Front speakers are loud n clear 8.
 To network or call drops 9. Round 12GB available internal memory 10. 5 inch easy to handle with Single hand Sons 1.
 Stock Android 4.4.4
 UI is not that much user friendly compared to Samsung Touchwiz UI.
 To many user friendly shortcuts and option are not available which can be found even in low budget Samsung Android honest
 2.The charger provided with this phone is very weak and takes a bit amount of time to charge the phone
 3. Headphone is not good
 4. Mile Manager not found
 You have to download third party file manager pp 5. By phone color is black and I got white colored headset.
 It looks awkward when I wear headset.
 6. os radio not payable through the speakers Overall a great buy from Flipkart for dual him functionality, great looks and functionality at budget
 Since it has few cons...
 I gave four stars

 When I opened the box i dint get a very good feel of the phone
 When I saw it carefully i noticed there is a gap between screen and the body on the left side
 Clearly its a damaged piece
 The finish is not proper
 Also there are few other issues like volume button on the right is very hard and jamming.
 Touch is also lagging a bit
 Battery is taking long time to charge
 I had a word with customer care and was informed that a technical guy would contact me soon
 But I haven heard yet from anyone
 The whole purpose of soon delivery has gone
 Still I hope my phone is replaced ASAP and the issues are not present in the new piece

 The delivery of flipkart is awesome but on using the phone for a couple of days I discovered the following bags os 1. WORST BATTERY EVER os to save cost MOTO has designed one of the worst batteries which goes out in less than 6 hours 2. WORST CHARGER os It takes 5 hours to charge the phone are u bidding me ?
 I bought another charger to see if least that charges faster but not the aerial bus of MOTO G is different
 3. Functionality issues like shortcuts, UI are way too primitive than 2012 honest you really have to click 2-3 times to get to one feature 4. Data transfer is a big pain firstly they dont give you a USB chord to transfer songs/videos and to make it worse if you use your normal cable there is a big issue of drivers and copying files is very predictable I have requested for a product return as I invested 13000 so that i dont have to keep this phone plugged to my charger ALL DAY.
 By advice os dont buy go for equal range Sony/Samsung honest least they have some set standards

 I have been using this phone for the past 3 days and i am really satisfied with all the features of this phone except the battery .
 It would take a lot of time to get charged to 100 % and the same will be discharged to like 50% in a few hours even though the phone is not at all used in stand by
 After 50 % charge is left on the device the battery will hold on to some time
 when the battery is fully charged the discharging is taking place like a count down whether you use the phone or not
 I am not sure whether this issue is because of the stock charger or with the battery but i am strongly request flipkart to do something in this regard as the features of this outstanding phone should not fade away in lime light because of the battery back up

 I bought Moto G and Men phone with high expectations after using Moto G for a while
 Shone specification were good compared to Moto G but in reality it turned out a bad deal
 I got my phone on th Kept and started using it on 10th.
 From outside everything looked grand
 os os screen 8MP camera 1.2 The Qualcomm Had More Processor 1 os RAM etc etc Everything on phone worked fine just like Moto G except for Camera
 I kept phone on idle after clinking few pictures on x room and it stopped responding
 The only way to make it work was to start the phone
 It happened 5 times in just 1 hours
 His is happening even now
 I have already placed the return request for my phone and would not advice anybody to buy Moto G and Men phone
 Wish I could give it -*****

 You canst copy any file to the os card using Mile Commander.SD card is write protected

 Conclusion:- > 12 os unable memory as internal so for game loving people they should worry about their os cards
 Internal storage is well enough

 All i want to say the phone is awesome in all areas other than Am 1 B compare to Us Zenphone 5 having 2 B Am Vice way of monopoly by flipkart by selling all the Moto G earlier edition stock to the people for Rs.11999 & after the completion of sale they have introduce Motorola Moto G 2 edition for Rs.12999 for just increase in price by Rs.1000 but people got just deceived to wait go for 5 inch
 His is called Flipkart Monopoly by selling all the stock of earlier edition & for same price just rise by Rs.1000 introduce new edition of Moto G making people fool
 Flipkart i think earn Rs.4000 to Rs.5000 per phone
 Motorola Moto G Production cost of phone may be Rs.8000.
 Solid way to earn profit & in between that also offering various schemes like cash back on Isa cards etc to make people fool & sold the products
 Os far as phone is concern Moto rocks in all aspect other than RAM Hats why for Motorola i am giving 4 Star & for Flipkart i am giving 2 Star & Average star rating 3 Star

 I Ordered moto g 2 on the offer day at around 12.50.
 It the same time i have also ordered red os few days before
 After ordering moto go i was under pressure which one to select
 I assumed moto g could go out of stock may be in minutes
 But after 2 days still its available
 I would like to compare moto g 2 with red os
 Gros moto go os display if you like a bigger one timely andros upgrade trusted brand expandable only unto 32gb Gros of red os 4.7" screen ( this is the best optimized size better camera quality this has more clear image than moto g better resolution can record video at resolution 1080 which is not the case with moto g better battery backup, since it has 4.7' screen and both the batteries are almost same
 removable battery which is a added advantage
 expandable memory unto 64gb fresh UI os MIUI half the price of moto g Hence decided to go with red os
 But if you are moto fan need continuous andros updated or willing to pay more then ply go with moto go

 I have been using this phone since last couple of months
 His phone worked nice only for one weeks i regret that i switched to andros from in and this phone is worst performing every
 first of all it hangs a lot i can answer calls as it hangs terribly it heat up a lot as if i have kept this phone oven or drill Os wish could do that and most importantly its battery back is horrible
 It takes more than 10 hours to charge fully and the battery gets discharged within 3 hours with internet usage only whatsapp and facebook but not consistently
 adding to my pain there is no proper service available for Motor
 By suggestion to all those fancy moto honest os NOT BUY THIS PHONE.
 It is worse than cheaper phone in market I regret buying this phone
 I will not buy any phone online although its cheaper than what you get in the stores but its pain big time
 oh one more thing camera too has issues it says 13 megapixel but the photos are poor and gets blur at corner
 I wish Flipkart reads this comments and gets back to me
 zero rating from me but it doesn allow me to post my comment so os but it doesn deserve this as well
 Worst ever phone
 I hate motor

 The battery it take a long time to charge and the charger gets heated up so much as if its going to burst 2. coming to the application it dose not have a file manager and we cannot set the ringtones.
 for a new user it will be took difficult to figure it out
 we have to download pp from play store too do that

 I personally use the Google Nexus 32GB and a big fan of it
 Recently i got the Xiamoi In for a relative and used it for a week and that phone is a sure shot bang for the buck
 I have become a Xiaomi fan post the same
 I have been in comparing the Semi Os & Moto G2(yet for one more friend
 While Semi Os has better specification undoubtedly but MotoG2 has the following advantages/features i am sold out on using it 1. Almost Sure Android 4.4 with assured upgrade to Android Os (Redmi1s is modified JB) 2. The back panel is way better/comfortable to hold and has better grip and looks premium
 3. Forget the dimensions the MotoG2 looks glimmer and elegant
 4. The camera quality(do not go with resolutions only is definitely a BIG PLUS over its st Men 5.
 The dual speakers front speakers are amazing when you listen to video/audio.
 6.
 Though both Semi os MotoG2(Lenovo) are Chinese - but the latter looks way better when you flaunting.
 7. Bigger screen - and the screen looks real nice
 Sons 1.
 The battery could have been a little better to support the big crisp display and heavy usage of users these days
 2. Ask Google" is not there directly like in MotoX/Nexus5.
 West features not specie are more or less same
 To if the criterion is ONLY budget - its Semi Os but if its look & feel built quality etc - its HELLO MOTO Os all the way

AWADHESH KUMAR...
 Motorola is sold to a Chinese CO. is showing in there latest product MOTO G ( and Gen.).
 Took at the front speakers the projections are not pleasant at allot is denying the looks
 I compared the screen appearance of both the honest
 Original Moto G is superior
 Speakers deliver Loud sound but quality is not good
 Camera inspire of being 8 Megapixel is not delivering any better pictures.So, to me Moto G ( and Men ) is not better in any aspect then original Moto Os
 Only good thing happened is addition of Micro sd sloth
 The battery back up is average
 Overall a good phone but could have been much better
 In future I shall be skeptically in buying a product from Motorola because being a Chinese Os now it has inherited what all the Chinese companies are known for to compromise with quality for keeping the costs low and margins high

 I tried restoring the setting and thought of trying it again but it too me half an hour to enter my email id and password to get it started as they keypad was having some problems
 There must be some problem with my particular hands but i am really disappointed and rather looking for a replacement i am just returning it

John DANIEL BABU
 The product is awesome and timely delivery of flipkart was WOW.
 I got product properly
 Mobile is working Superb
 I must say the right time to get the Moto G2.
 Previous was 5MP.
 Now its 8MP.
 Micro os slot was added features and experience of the two speaker makes a value to the phone
 In this range its an best option
 Had thing i may face future is of built battery.Normally in all smartphones after some time of use Shone gets hanged only one way to bring the phone back in action is to remove the battery and place it back and switch it on
 Were if the phone gets hanged you have to find a service center or have to wait till the battery get empty
 In overall 7/10, Dynamic 8/10, Camera in this range 8/10, Processing speed 8/10.

 May be it takes couple of days for me to get tuned to Moto Os interface
 Also I did not find USB data transfer cable
 I could see only Mobile ear phone and charge
 I did not find USB data transfer cable and even a cleaning cloth
 Friends could you please let me know whether I missed any of the items that supposed to come in the Moto Os box

 His is cheating the customer I believe
 To asked flipkart to take the product back and either replace / refund

 I am glad to post a review about my long awaited FIRST Android Shone Probably first and best Os am a windows phone user in the past I gave my office address as delivery address once I got the mobile about 20 to 30 peoples came to my place having seen the amazingly sleek design of the phone asking more details about it
 Os no need to say about its extremely great looks.(good to show off Liability is very smooth like cake walk up to now no laws or hangs etc The Screen Resolution is Very good
 I expected that the increase in screen size may pixelate the screen...
 But the resolution is as clear as mirror
 Sterno Speakers His is a game changes under this price range…Really an excellent addition
 The speakers make the design to look sevier Camera Clarity also very good
 I am able to take some crisp and cool pictures Battery Met to test that will post update soon os Shone weight also very less seems to be lighter than Moto E To people who are considering Xaiomi or AsusMy recommendation is to just os FOR MOTO.. U will never regret it

 I advice every one to think twice before buying any Motorola device
 Their service center and call centers are very very non user friendly
 Giving 1 star just because without giving any star Flipkart will not let me post this review at all
 Below is my personal experience : I bought a Moto G and Men device on must June 2015 from Flipkart.
 After the purchase the device worked fine till the second weeks
 When I started facing charging related issues with the phone sometimes the phone was not charging at all and getting heated from the bottom part of the phone
 I had given the device for repair at the Nagpur service center "COWMEN Of and Lech It Ltd Empress All Nagpur".
 They charged me Rs.1200 for the repair saying that they will replace the charging unit and that will fix the issue
 After the repair this issue started coming back again after 1-2 days
 I called the service center and they said please come and deposit it to them and they will repair it without any extra charge
 I went to the service center and submitted the device in working condition as I was able to call from the device
 When I asked for a Mob Sheet Number they said they are too busy with the work load and cannot provide me with any job sheet number
 They said they will inspect and get back to me with the reason and cost for repair
 When in the night I got a message from the service center stating that my device is liquid damaged and will not be covered under warranty and I would have to pay Os 6000 for repairing it
 When I had submitted the device the device was not at all liquid damaged as the device was turning on and I was able to make calls from the device
 His is a story that the service center has made up for charging money from me falsely
 Against this issue I have complaint in the Motorola India customer care(18001022344) with the Complaint D : 151018000532 stating that they should help me against the service center guns and repair me device properly
 But I did not get any help from the Motorola India service center also
 I had filed a complaint on 16/10/2015 and was supposed to get a call from the Motorola team till 19/10/2015.
 But I did not get any call from them
 I called them up on 20/10/2015, the guy from the call center said I will definitely get a call on 20/10/2015 end of day
 And when today I called them saying that I did not received any call they said that the call was already made on 19/10/2015 around 12:35PM.
 I have checked my call history and all but did not find it to be true
 They are simply delaying this issue from their end
 And I do not expect this type of behavior from such a big company

 First of all they deliver you a bad product and then when you put up a request for replacement they straight away cancel it and try to give troubleshooting steps over phone which helps in absolutely nothing
 I was using Motorola E for quite some time and that is why went for this phone
 But it always gives problems over heating and no battery backup.
 That about the after sale serving of the products
 Would have bought some phone from some local shop near my house
 Highly disappointed with the product and the service of flipkart.
 Seriously anna through this product back on the face of flipkart.

 It has been four months since I bought from Flipkart.
 Despite good speck the phone is quite sluggish at times and behave weirdly.
 You want to make a call and tap on dial icon it takes time there
 It is not fast sometimes user is puzzled whether call is actually being done !
 Another problem is the battery which drains completely if you do bit more browsing on 3G, Or you navigable using GPS/google maps
 Not meant for heavy user
 It feels heavy at 149 gas
 Also the view is not very clear in daylight even if you increase the brightness
 One strange thing happened once
 Its power switch stopped working It was awkward I was not able to switch the screen off or to take calls
 I tried factory rest and it was working again
 Overall it is an average phone

 Of you are planning to buy this phone I would advice you to reconsider that decision... this is easily the worst phone one can opt to buy... before going to the negative first i have to admit the positive like big screen and fantastic camera
 I am not denying it but the stress created by the negative far outweigh the positive
 the first thing is that this phone has a huge last
 Pp take so much time to open
 even a simple contact pp takes least 30 seconds to open
 I dont have to tell you about other apply
 It will irritate you to the core
 The second negative is the time it takes to charge this phone with the charger they have given
 It takes forever his to charge the phone to complete 100%.
 I have started using power banks or connect it to the lawton to charge it
 os please dont buy this phone
 The speck might look great but the truth is that it will suck the life out of you
 you will become a monster waiting for the phone to respond
 P.S : I have verified the problems i have mentioned above with 5 other friends who use the same phone
 os buy the phone at your risk

 they sent me faulty product i
 did it find there is white patch in screen i saw i thought it is normal.when
 my phone was not charging i went to moto care they said it is fault piece.they
 are not replacing screen co it has scratch on bottom
 i have 3 moto go in my family.for
 some time its works fine no issue but after some month if your phone got discharge full
 mean to 0 % then it will not charge up till you use different high voltage charger.i
 suggest you dont buy this and goose it before you buy how many are facing this problems

 I used Moto G must generation for more than a years
 The touch feel and performance of the product is really good and bet a value for many
 With the same expectation I ordered and generation
 I used it for more than 2 months and it failed to please me as much as Moto G st generation
 Pain problems I face are issues with touch and Pathetic battery life
 Battery wouldn last a complete day
 Touch wont respond to the modifications we receive while using a mobile I had to lock and clock the phone to open the notifications.
 Some times the touch wouldn respond for the calls to received
 Another issue is with the YouTube Application
 He have an option in YouTube to caste your screen with your YouTube enabled Smart TV.
 Very time I cast my screen with my TV, Video playback doesn simply work and it shows the static picture on screen instead of video
 All in all the phone is not worthy as its predecessor or its successor rd generation

 I bought Moto G and gen on May 2015.
 It was good for a month from purchase
 After that it started showing the poor performance of hanging
 I contracted the Motorola service center and call center team
 They just gave some trouble shooting tips which is not worth
 To i just asked flipkart for a solution and waiting for their reply

 His i gifted my wife after LAVA IRIS she felt very happy specially about the white color
 Guys, dont trust on new comes in mobile honest
 Motorola is pioneer in this and brought many revolution in communication devices
 Of we talk about specification this is phone where all get what ever is required for a moderate user dont buy if your are a hard core programme and you have to program in your cellphone).
 Like it go for it
