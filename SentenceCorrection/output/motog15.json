 His mobile is very good speed battery back up and awesome speaker sound
 Camera quality is also superb
 I bought Moto g st generation for rubles 14000/- and Moto g and generation I bought for 11749/-.
 But specification are better for Moto go compare with Moto go
 To we are getting more features with less prices
 Even flipkart delivery also awesome less than one day I got the product with any extra money...
 I love flipkart shopping
 Thank flipkat and Motorola for your better and quality services

 Dear Flipkart Beams I have purchased this set around 10 days back
 devices looks response Internet music etc are all very good
 But there is a noise sound sometimes during the calls which is very annoying
 Please suggest how to resolve the issue otherwise I would be compelled to go for refund
 Also confirm if we can make video calls directly through this hands or not
 Regards Irish

 Thank god I made the right choice Perfect phone in this price range ; specially if you want to gift someone ;-) Must one feedback though : It will only work with Company Provided MicroSIM and not the CUT ones Hence dont get too disappointed if your SIM shows disabled if you are using a CUT microsim.. Change the SIM with a company ( Service Provider ) terrified MicroSim and It will work fine

 I ordered Moto Os on 17 November 2014 and the product got delivered on 18 November 2014 The product which i received have more defects
 I found that my mobile having these issues after days
 Not only this mobile all the MOTO Os have the same issues
 Recently my friend also bought the mobile and suffering with these issues
 Us be careful dont go for MOTO G2.] 1. Echo Problem Of someone call to you they will hear their voice to them
 You wont get the echo 2. Battery Brain Within Wars battery getting drained and mobile got switched off 3. Automatically call disconnected continuously
 To i requested for refund but Flipkart refused to give refund and they told we ill give a replacement for the mobile on 27 November 2014.
 The newly arrived product also have the same issues and again i called flipkart and requested for refund
 They instructed me to go to the MOTO service center and get the "JOB SHEET" & "DOA" for refund
 I visited the MOTO service center as usual they very not responsible with big fight with them got "JOB SHEET" & "DOA" then scanned those and send it to flipkart then only they refused my money on 11 December 2014.
 His is a very bad experience i had

 I ordered for this phone on thursday and got a message that it will be delivered to me by next friday eventually I gave my officers address for the delivery
 In Saturday morning I get a call form the number 9643303932 that whether I am available at the address for the delivery since Saturday was an off I requested the delivery man to deliver it to me on Monday even inquired if the same can be delivered in the alternate address but he agreed for delivering it on Monday at my office address only
 In monday I waited the whole day and tried to call at the given number to confirm if the delivery will be done but there was no response and neither the courier boy contracted I left office late expecting for a call back but all in veins
 To my shock I receive a message at night that the since the delivery was attempted twice and couldn be completed hence the order stands canceled
 when was the and attempt made can I get an explanation of it?????
 I wanted this to gift to someone and I am a regular shipper from Flipkart, and after this incident I will have to think before making any purchase from this site
 Thankfully I speed for COD otherwise my money would have unnecessarily blocked as they would have given the credit to my wallet which means I have to use the money for shopping at this site only

 I ordered from fast delivery and dam it was fast than i expected.The packing was good
 os retailer is the best seller on Flipkart by far
 The Moto Os is the probably the best the best smart phone in this price range
 It function good and its very smooth in use
 Also the lolipop update are rolling out soon for Moto G2. 16 os built and expandable memory unto 32 os is the best feature all the phone should have
 The 8 up camera does the job very well and also you can download Google Camera for more features if you are into photography and stuff
 the front firing speakers are awesome and are very loud and clear you will enjoy watching movies).
 The 5 inch os display works good in broad day light (sunlight).
 The company claim that the phone is water resistant though I have not tested it never will
 Other features such as Motorola Migrate Motorola Alert Motorola Assist just make your contact photo,video...etc transfer easily and fast once you figure out its easy
 I would recommend you to go for it

 The Moto Os is well worth the ask paid
 It gives good performance for a normal user
 I am not sure how will it react with heavy applications
 But I am happy with my purchase
 Sons ------- Camera is a bit let down on low light photography but its part and parcel with a low budget smart phone the plastic cover on the back side is too flies and each time I opened it I felt like its going to break :-) Flipkart logistics is awesome!

 well , i since i always check comments before buying anything online , i thought it as my moral responsibility to write a review .
 phone itself is AWESOME .
 crystal clear display os rock solid os no laws in games .
 with a awesome 8MP camera..its camera is wayyyyy better than SONY or samson imp camera .
 the only issue is battery , and happy headphones the comes in the box
 i had to buy good headphones of panasonic worth Os 849 separately if
 u rout , working os and u r not using the phone much except music and stuff , at the end of the day u have approve 30% battery left
 but u are gaming and downloading , and using it heavily , it wont last more than 9-10 hours
 final words go for it.its
 still the best in the price range dont believe on happy imp camera of spice and other bands which costs just 8000 bucks .
 they dont last a day literally !

 I purchased a Moto G and generation on 19-10-2014.
 Today the st button to on or off the mobile / wake it from the sleep mode is not working
 I was directed by flipkart to one of the third party service agency for repair .
 I am not sure about the authenticity of the service provider
 Flipkart is not providing the Motorola email id / phone number
 Beware before you purchase any motorola mobile I submitted the device for motherboard change on 24-12-2014 to the authorized service provider as per their advised
 The service provider said that that it will take a week to get the mother board I am speaking to Motorola and the service person for the past 20 days and nothing is happening
 There are conflicting versions from Motorola and the service provider regarding the service
 I received a message from Motorola that the device has been repaired
 But to my surprise the service provider is saying that the mother board is yet to be received by them and it will take more time
 When I spoke to motorola, they are not at all helpful
 Os on date idea
 13-01-2015, I am yet to get the mobile back from the service provider
 Os such I request all the potential purchasers to think before placing any order on motorola mobile as the Motorola products are substandard and useless

 this is best phone in the same price range
 except memory slot there is not any single drawback
 screen resolution is crisp & clear
 one of the biggest advantage is that its software is upgrade to latest Android version idea 4.4.4.
 Outcome of camera is sons but we can expect to much from the phone of this price range
 heating & hanging like issues are also not with this phone

 i also requested a return but the process has not been successful yet
 Purchased so many items (Books, ear phone mobiles... etc...) for the first time FLIPKART has disappointed me

 I bought moto g at very initial days of its release & felt gem of its kind piece.Now I wanted to get another mobile.So with the past experience with moto go blandly I booked its and gen as the old one is not available.Now things are not same as the time I had moto g st genu
 I dont know the reason why i am not comfortable with the and genu is that reason the screen with less PPI, Os that the reason the call quality seems to be choice is that the reason the font and pp logs seems larger than the usual moto g st genu is that the reason battery which is poor in comparison with its old friend dont know..I am missing my old moto g now which i have given to my sister wish Flipkart & Moto bring the old one back into place

 Am sure you are buying this phone as you think that its an unfordable Android with amazing features
 Please read this review before you take the plunge I have received two Moto G Second Men from Flipkart.
 BOTH WERE DEFECTIVE.
 First piece delivered on th December .
 Started twitching off automatically and then starting from th December
 Cried Factory Beset but it was of no use
 Placed a replace order
 Not a new piece on 15 December
 I must say Flipkart is very efficient and prompt in customer care
 I checked the box as soon as I got the package and it was not tempered
 Cried to insert the SIM card and it was not popping in (SIM card is fine
 Cried it on other phones).
 To remember when you are buying this phone there is a very very good chance that you may receive not one but two faulty phone in a rows
 Still want to purchase this Shone ?
 Good Luck to you Highly Disappointed Moto os Met your act together

 There was a memory card on offer for free if order placed from an pp
 I placed the order and got the delivery today and there was no memory card When i called the customer support they decline there was any such offer
 There was an offer if paid by si debit card 10% off with a cap on maximum
 The page for si payment was just not working so could not avail that offer as well
 Last i placed the order for a cover as well the seller for the cover was different
 I am being charged delivery charges for the cover
 I had both the items in cart and cart value close to 13.5 K still 50 os for delivery does not sound right
 Seller is different or same is not customers order if order value is high there should not be delivery charge
 His is my second bad experience with flipkart.
 By the day the quality etc is going down

 When i first received the handset, there was a bright permanent spot on the screen
 When i requested flipkart for exchange
 When i received the second handset, it used to get heated up to high temperature while using internet and during calls
 And even the charger gets heated up during charging
 When I requested for refund after a bad experience at Motorola service centre
 Flipkart promptly responded to my concern and approved my refund
 After sales service is very important whenever we invest on a smart phone
 And my experience says samson is the best in this regard

 His phone is perfect and the best you can get in this prices
 Performance is very good(even with only go of ram as this runs stock android(snapdragon 400 just makes things even better
 The gorilla glass 3 protection makes it look premium and also provides protection against scratches(i.e.
 you dont need a screen protector
 Also the screen contrast and color production is just great it beats many of the 20k+ phone in this aspect
 Overall this phone is just perfect for someone looking for a good display and a powerful performance phone in this price range

 FIRST AND FOREMOST: I GOT THE BOX os WHICH THE "FCC ID" AND "TYPE" LABEL NAILED, BUT I os NOT KNOW WHY os IS?
 I have been using the phone for 20 days with almost 9 os filled memory and 25 apes installed
 Now the advantages good screen clarity,smooth browsing experience of apps(but RAM uses around 500 os without any running app),personalised care from motorola,lag free multitasking though not equivalent to a go realm phone),upgradation to the lollipop 5.0,slim body-not edges
 Disadvantages Battery back is poor,speakers and apiece not so good as the company claims sound is hollow and shattered on high volume,earphones are of cheap quality(plastic make but deliver good sounding data cable in package
 Of the company increases its talkative back by unto 2 hours(it will increase internet browsing approve
 unto 4 hours in the next andros update then it is a good products

 His has happened within few weeks of purchase
 I shall go to the nearest service center and see what they will do

 Not the phone on flipkart with SBI cashback for 11,700.
 Delivery and packing were great as usual
 Boxing I loved the sharp,bright and big display.Touch sensitivity is great and absolutely love the display
 16gb internal with go sd card is sufficient for my use and decent processing speed for my medium usage
 Keyboard is great for testing and no issues even with the camera
 It takes more than decent photo
 However there a few issues
 Battery is good with 20hrs back with my medium to low usage
 Drawback 1. Definitely a bit heavy 2. A full charge takes 4 hours which is slow 3. Earphones sound quality is terrible 4. With heavy use with even multi apes left open there is a lag and it definitely needs go Same

 Delivery was good from Flipkart.
 The packing was superb mindblowing.
 Boxing the phone was a great experience
 Moto G 2 is an example set by Motorola to other companies like Samsung.
 Build quality is awesome.
 Elastic back is unable and smudge proof
 Shone doesn lag in heavy games.Battery is average for a game but Recent for normal users
 Motorola could have given 2GB Am instead
 Its an incremental update to Moto G not those revolutionary changes
 Processor is the same
 Would have improved
 But though its my first Android, lucky to get this one

sohan patil
 first of already this review carefully if you are going to buy this phone this your decision is correct ...only fault is that camera is of 8 os when you are going to capture some (15-20) photos in sunlight mobile gets hang and it heated took much so mobile takes 5 mind to come in normal condition and and second problem when you are going to charge the phone with power bank it heat slightly than charging with motorola charger except above faults the phone is excellent as it is open source andros and can get latest updated from goose at last my option is buy this phone if you are interested

 To doubt its a great and killer phone which gives very good performance but since I have used it for a more than month now it is started getting problems
 First the battery is lasting me as it was lasting when the phone was new
 Second sometimes the speakers of the phone dont stop playing the track or audit even if I paused or stopped the audit then I have to cruelly shutdown the phone while it is playing the audit to stop the speakers
 Third sometimes the apiece speaker dont let me to hear my callers voice as it doesn provide any sound while on the call sometimes
 When also I have to shutdown the phone and start it to make a call again
 Now irritating is that Motor
 The person on some forum suggested me to order for replacement
 To you tell me Flipkart what should I do now

 Used it for more than 2 months now
 Satisfactory
 For the price it comes with it definitely packs a punch
 I have faced 2 major issues thought 1.) Battery Pathetic
 Pathetic Pathetic
 I need to charge at least thrice a day for continuous use
 Forget continuous use even when I dont use it gets drained as hell
 I am a college student
 I just keep it in my bag when I go to college at around 50-60pc charge
 To mobile data no wife I just check my phone is the breaks for about 10-15 seconds
 When I come back from college and half hours I have 10-15 percent charge remaining !
 Atrocious !
 To top it all up it need more than 3 hours to charge a hundred percent
 Very 5 minutes of charge hardly increases battery by 2 percent
 2.) Camera Quality of pictures is superb
 Oats off
 Problem is the time it takes to focus
 Almost 15-20 seconds
 To if you want to take a really fast snap you just can do !

 "Background" I ordered the set on with sept 2014) and got it delivered on (17th septa after certain delays in shipping it
 The brighter side To doubt the product has marvellous features a good came display-sound quality,touch annals that at a price of 13k.
 Its your perfect muddy for running apes and being updated....TILL os STOPS os FUNCTION os THE DARKER TRUTH.. AND CONTINUING FRUSTRATION I os STILL FACING: By set stopped working on th dec (IN JUST 3MONTHS!!)it was not even twitching on only motorola andros was getting displayed with a lot of anger and frustration and still with a hope to get it right at moto service centre weather next day itself i explained them the problem and they asked to submit my set after having the voice to replace a part which was a manufacturing defects
 Its been like 8-10 days and they still haven got the parts(thats what they say and have given me only a receipt of their shop with no signatures and asked to wait for another couple of weeks They have not even given another set for use for the time being.This case has happened with many more and i think if in a city like Lumbar they are not able to transport the parts for their valued customer was they say while selling then may god help those buying moto products from smaller cities To criticism for product features but disability and customer satisfaction ke male me its not a company to rely on personal experience

Moto U should give good battery backup.....Expecting some improvement from u for our mobile....

 according to this their delivery timing is very nice,every time i called to their customer care they responded me well and replied with good answers what i asked them
 Shone is good screen having cornell glass makes it more different from other phone .
 Battery back up is nice.depends on what we do with our honest
 Display and resolution is very good
 Supports OTG(On the Os USB Cable.as
 moto g dont have its own file manager so we can download from play store and then we can attach pensive and play the movies,or any file

 Phone's him slot does not work THE MOMENT I TOOK os OUT os THE BOX.
 Flipkart told me it is a manufacturers defect so i need to contact them no help from flipkart.
 Motorola service center is asking me to pay 3000 for a slim sloth i am pretty sure that this is a huge amount for a him slot repair
 i am highly disappointed from Flipkart's and Motorola's service
 I growled and found out that slim slot issue is a common problem with MotoG2, I will not recommend this phone

 Before I start with my review I must state a fact that I was using Galaxy Grand Quos prior to buying Moto Os & I had no intention to dump Grand before it got tricked due to an accidental short circuiting of the motherboard but that is an altogether different story…let me continue with Moto G2.
 I ordered for a Moto Os Black 16Gb on th Dec & the phone was delivered on th Neck First of all the pro Easy to point out as they are few 1. Really smooth body finish…phone looks are good & sleek 2. Good camera both front and back 3. Battery is not that bad as pointed in other reviews I am getting almost 36-40 hours back with pretty good usage of whatsapp, internet gazing music and other apply
 Now the harsh truths about the phone His phone looks so much half baked that it wonders me whether the developer had any thoughts about the people using it or they just rolled this phone out to take advantage of the Moto-Flipkart comb hyper 1.
 The touch of this phone is hopeless…the phone suddenly freeze in between and stops responding to any amount of touch then suddenly starts
 Doesn’t respond to touch of fingers almost every time but responds to touch of thumb
 Compared to this Samsung touch is butter smooth & without any hiccup.
 2. I have tried possibly everything to shut off touch pad noise…disabling it from sound settings dating phone..application permission but nothing at all has worked…seems like a fault in my piece & hence I am planning to return this phone
 3.
 You need to install an pp to permanently stay on a Os network which is not the case with Samsung where u just need to select WCDMA mode in this phone there is an option to set your preference to be on Os mode but it doesn work
 4.
 There is no wide for torch flashlight…u need to install an pp for it
 5. want add speed dials….need to install an pp for it
 6.
 To file manager….again
 need to install an pp for it
 7. Ratification panel is really crappy…for person like me who switches on/off data network its a huuuuuuge PIA to go through settings and all just to turn on/off data…seriously developer what were you smoking??? os  os again need to install an pp for it
 8. want add any song directly as your ringtone….. Overall I feel if you really anna go for a 10k+ phone there are many many more option available in the market..explore everything before serving on this one

 I bought this phone from Flipkart within first 10 minutes of its sale
 I was happy about my purchase with whatever limitations the phone has
 But my happiness was short lived as the screen had a crack after a drop from hardly 2 feet height under gravity
 Before this I was using an phone Samsung Omnia, Foka Gumma and each phone was dropped from considerable heights but nothing happened
 His proves that the MOTO G and Men is outstanding and extremely fragile
 More than the fragility of the phone I got passed off with the phone because of the after sales service offered by MOTOROLA at Kanpur.
 The authorized service center person has told that it would cost me some where about 7000/- and he offered a magnanimous discount of 300/-.
 The new phone costs 12999/- where as the screen costs you 7000/-.
 Either the Motorola is footing the customer or the authorized service center is footing
 Must because of the service center the phone will get a single star rating
 Some on Motorola, please control your authorized service centers they are bringing bad reputation to your brandy
 Of it continues this way very soon your brand will undo all the good work of recent times

 well to start of the os screen and the resolution are quite impressive along with the overall design the moto go is superior to any other phone which comes in the same price range but what the problem was is that it heat up while using internet or playing games and drains battery considerably
 But it compensated this by its high speed interface and memory .
 Overall its a good buy and value for money is guaranteed in my previous orders flipkart's delivery sucked but this time it was really fast i got the phone in just 4 days that was awesome.

 His is my first smart phone
 Rose Good Speed for browsing Multi Asking is excellent Pain Camera is good Front camera is not bad it has good speakers
 I haven played any games with the device so i canst comment on that subject
 Life and disability is yet to be determined
 Sons Battery is charging slowly and it drains quickly
 I am not surprised by this as this is the case with most of the smart honest
 Data Cable is not available with the mobile even though plenty of micro us cable are available in the market Moto should have provided the data cable
 After Installing Battery saving apes Battery Doctor now the Battery life is good
 Overall its a good phone at this prices

 Product is excellent but the delivery using DELHIVERY delivery partner is pathetic
 The product started on Act 14, 2014, 4:53 pump from Bangaluru and reached to my city on Act 16, 2014, 10:19 army
 within 41 hours and it was laying eggs in the office of DELIVERY till Act 17, 2014, 7:11 pump when it was handed over to me and that too without eggs
 His last delivery partner took 33 hours to deliver it within the city
 By address may be just 2-3 km from the office of DELHIVERY in my city
 That is the use of making haste in sending the product from its origin city
 Or this is another scheme to extract money from your esteemed buyers
 Take delay in delivery and ultimately all will become Flipkart First members
 Good scheme to collect Os 500 from each one

 I have been using Moto G and Men since 1 week now and I am pretty happy with the performance of the phone
 The only major drawback that I can identify right now is that for some reason Motorola does not have its log printed on the front of the phone
 The log is there on the back but if I use a protective cover the log gets hidden
 Basically apart from myself no one else gets to know that it is a Moto G and Men

 I purchased MOTO G and gen from flipkart.
 the delivery was within reasonable time but the product itself was not as expected
 the hardware quality is very poor the touchscreen was problematical from day one
 It stops sanctioning within one and half months of purchase and currently lying at the service center for repair
 The RAM was not adequate the processor sometimes laws and if used continuously for few minutes it heat so much that it was not comfortable to hold in the hand
 Overall very poor quality product keeping in consideration its low price also .

 Handset has good features but I feel some points to be improved... 1. Secondary camera is good but primary camera not as good as it to be for 8 MP.
 Us Men 5 has better than this
 2. Camera has less settings/Features.
 3. os radio not have option to play in loud speaker
 4. To one application for All recording work to record both side
 otherwise all other features are good
 You can think for Tendon 5 for better camera

 I got a free os card and was ready to go
 It has amazing looks and perfect hardware for an andros pp developer like me
 The camera are excellent
 However the hittel offer didn really work for me as yet
 The earphones do not match the quality of the phone and the 5.0 update isn exactly up and running but it should come soon
 The screen is nice and Motorola outside themselves
 The phone is a poorhouse rather than a black candy bare
 Mind you you dont get a USB cable with this piece
 I love my phone

 Some comments not mentioned in the earlier reviews
 Shone is fantastic butter smooth and pleasing to use 1. Thought that goose contact will automatically son after signing in and using Migrate but did not happen
 Had to transfer the cf file from my Samsung to get all my contact
 SIM card contact of course did since
 2. Cannot force the phone to use 3G.
 I use a DOCOMO connection and it changes from E to H and Os randomly.
 Would be a problem of Docomo.
 3. Started the day with full battery at 6:30 os and by 8:15 , of constant listening to music and using Os + Os the battery reached 76%.
 To I am not sure if the battery will last the day
 Charged the phone for 8 hours by the way
 4. Using Samsung earphones , the audit seems good
 The provided headphones dont look or feel good 5. Migrate transferred most of my apes , settings etc
 A really good feature to have
 Only if it had transferred my contact took I would have been giving this a 5 rating
 6. Feels good in the hands , easy for reading

 It has been 20 days since i got this device from Flipkart.
 To start with I had my own concerns after going through the reviews
 But then finally made up my mind to go for it
 And I dont regret it one bit
 Below are the pro and sons i observed in these 20 days of usage
 PROS: 1.
 Both front and back camera are just fine
 His come out pretty decent
 Obviously u canst expect DSLR quality in this price range
 2. 1 os RAM is more than enough to run all the apes and games smoothly on this device and the quand core processor is pretty good with no laws so far
 3. Front speakers are great
 Round cracks a little at high volume but that''s not a major issue at all 4. Smooth touch and awesome looks
 CONS: To far the only issue i have faced is the battery back up
 Its not really good but then you can always carry a power bank along with you
 In the end I would just say its a good product from MOTO and definitely a great value for money
}
{
VaruN
 Overall the product is good am satisfied with the product.The battery back is good enough.The display and sound quality is good enough.The small issue is with the moto camera small time lag is occurring while auto focusing,which is negotiable.The touch to focus is little difficult to get focused on a particular thing from some more number of things.Through a long use of camera,battery is getting heat
 I think moto can over come these issues through the updated

 well i ordered my moto g and gen and when i opened the box it looks so pretty and when i hold it in my hand i feel it so compatible in my hands bc i thought that 5 inch displays phone ll b bulky but it was not it was so compatible in my hand and gives me a decent look... now come to the product which i got
 prose
 os awesome look os mitka 4.4.
 as u all know upgradable up to next os
 Os which is the best part of this
 os awesome camera capture with rear as well as by front came
 os god battery life gives me 1 day of backup.. which is good for my personal use
 cost got faulty product as i said os plastic back panel but it was mentioned that the panel is made of polycorbonic matt finish os which gives u rubburised feel
 os it was lagging even in small graphics games
 like subways surf where my funds same product not laws at all in any game weather it is of higher graphics or smaller graphics games conclusion the sons which i have mentioned was of the faulty products
 well i made a return request for my product and flipkart has accepted my request and promised me to deliver the new product at with of deck
 so i will wrote my original review on original product... but i must say flipkart return policy is best that why i always came to flipkart for shopping two stars for the faulty product... but i will increase stars when i get satisfied with my replaced product... till date enjoy with two stars...

 Moto G and Men filled in the space between Data G st Men and Moto X quite well
 I found it to be good enough for using as compared to some high end phone by Samsung and other bands
 Treaty good build... Very Durable.
 Performance wise.... there no lag when using it for gaming or other applications
 Battery wise.... it has a satisfactory performance like any other Android Handset in the market
 Over all.... its a winner

 Awesome Shone against money spent
 - Create camera - Round Quality is good ( headeset is poor quality but if you get new one from market or use existing good one will get good quality of sound ) - Touch is great
 - Shone Speed and processing is awesome, I played lots of games and download ashplat and many big d games played many times no hang or no heating issue
 - Battery life is decent over wife works full day (24 Mrs and in g - g works works around 14 - 15 his - One of the major thing which is not written or i didn get in specification is it supports OTG.
 Which is quite surprise for me after buying :-), I tested with my micromax tax keyboard winston and sands pensive - data transfer is great and supports major items
 - Its also come with latest android.
 To for more g second gen if you have this budget dont go behind any other brand like samsung, ll or panasonic.
 I also have Foka 620, it also good on same price if you like windows
 Any user dont like this but if you want stable product and better battery go for windows
 By battery live unto 2 days with wife and more than a day in Os with type calling and watsapp essaying :-)

 First of all quick delivery by flipkart.
 Not it on second day of order at Kerala.
 Delivery man came to my officer he called me 5 times as i was not there i was unable to attend he left me a message
 When i called him back he came again to my office to deliver it
 Usually courier people call us on phone and ask us to collect shipment from their officer
 About Shone By budget was ask .
 Searched on internet for months and finally decided about Moto go
 Shone looks stunning
 It is easy to handle as it is curve shaped
 Display and Camera are good for the budget
 Sterno speakers are awesome.
 Battery was the biggest issue for which i didn buy it earlier
 But after using 3 days i m satisfied with it
 Battery lasted unto pm since morning for last 2 days for moderate using
 And USB OTG function is working fine we could transfer data @ 15mbps from a us pendrive.
 Who should go for it
 Of your budget is near 15 (20 if u want OTG on phone u want a 5 inch phone that is easy to handle and looks good go for it
 But if u want to use net throughout day go for any other phone or buy one power bank also with moto go

 Oats Off to Flipkart's Delivery system with commendable packing of the phone
 For MOTO G os all looks dam fine
 Must in case UI is somewhat makes it look ordinary
 still Great Work both Flipkart and Motorola.

 Ordered the product on the launch day and also got launch day offers
 VFM phone as it has water proof screen along with Gorilla glass 3.Definitely a one to consider though there are other bands that give tough competition
 Advantage : os Waterproof screen os Since a Google product latest Android updated would be available
 To go for it if you really are considering the above features as beneficial.In case you can handle phone better and not much gathered about Android update there are definitely other brand phone that can be considered

 Actually i liked it when it was with my friends and they recommended me
 I even saw its performance when it was with them and battery back was also fine
 But when i bought this then my problem started
 It over heat a lot for a 5 mind call,just call & can feel it through the back cover
 him talking about back case covering over back panel
 It fell like burning inside canst keep in pocket
 When using internet or searching map by using internet it heat like hell & battery drain my god .
 Battery comes down to 55% from hundred for just one hour of Whatsapp and facebook.
 just the 2 pp
 i installed some high performance games can play because either the device gets heated or a battery gets drained
 But when in my friends case , for them the device works smoothly
 have ordered a refund or a replacement lets see
 Of i get a perfect normal piece ill write the review for that also

 with in short time .
 and even the features are good and by and and rd day started noticing the battery usually was taking more time to get charged fully,around 5-6 hours.and
 also draining of the battery was faster within 6-8 hours
 the product as the Spear issue , when i receive a call or dial a call the glass break sound appears where is it gives the disturbance in the voice .
 hence i have raised the complaint and replaced the device with the other moto go , where in this mob also there is a minor in voice glass break and disturbance in the Spear call
 and also there is a problem with charger / battery where it wont get charge continuously when it is in changing with minor shake discontent the process and get incomplete in the charging Flipkart need to check the product once Quality product then process to the service To again i have raised the complaint to get the issue resolve and waiting for the resolution

 I had ordered 2 mobile phone on the th of November and i was happy when i saw that they arrived a day early that was the last thing i was happy bout with this mobile
 May 3 started my struggle with the phone getting constantly getting hung up and getting over heated
 called the customer service eye who told me that its normal for the phone to get heated up and that i should not complain about it
 i was very much upset about the product and now the customer service was even more hurtful.
 eventually i requested for a replacement reaching the limit of my patience and i get a call back saying that hanging is a natural thing and that i should restore my phone to factory setting and that it would solve my problems
 and that said we will call u back to check if the trouble shoot has worked or not which they never did
 and went ahead and closed my request saying that we can take a return request as we solved your problems
 how does this even sound logical
 than a few days later i call up again to place a replacement request this time they say that they are replacing the phone as they accept its faulty
 and said that the phone will reach me on the
 i was keeping a track of it on their webster and i was waiting for my phone the last i checked it said that the product was dispatched from bangalore.
 and is expected in Hyderabad.
 and the very next day it said return request is canceled
 i was shocked and called up the customer care and they said it was canceled due to logistical problems
 and they said they were placing a request immediately and that the product will be delivered today
 i called in specifically to ask if it can be deliver on today as i was out of station but i got a call yesterday saying i need to come collect the product some 4-5 ms away from my delivery point
 i told him that i am not in the city and asked him to come today for which he responded very rudely I quote Pain thumara Makar name turn agar chaheyae to a ke lent nahito return kardunga" i was shocked and requested him to deliver it today
 he finally agreed after repeated calling and said he will be delivering it by 11 am today
 i haven got call till now so i called up the customer care and expressed my disappointed she just disconnected my call and i was put through to the survey
 I can understand that u guns dont have the intent to help but this is retarded
 lost hope on e-commerce.
 thanks to one company
 Motorolla you have done a big mistake by selecting flipkart as your only retailer
 dont know about you but i am a customer am completely disappointed

 Battery does not last even 5 hours when g is ON.(Random usage Most shocking : To data cable in the box os Os charger provided in box is a NON - USB PLUG os type charge which charges the battery at a dead slow rate of 20% for 1 hour os

 After it got replaced within a month I am again facing touch screen issues

 Looking forward to your urgent support

 Not mine yesterday
 I was surprised at the great build quality
 I have been using a Samsung Galaxy os S5830i for the past two years so this phone is a great upgrade for me
 Software - Moto Os is known for running near stock andros and is going to get the latest andros version Lollipop soon and the next years andros version or Android M release falls in the phone 18 month upgrade window took which means this phone will run the latest software unto 2016 or till Android N release
 All in all we are up for a great software experience
 Hardware/Specs - I personally have a list of minimum speck that I need on my phone and Moto G 2014 fits most of them
 In 8 os Dear Cam ✓ In 720p Screen ✓ In 1 os Am ✓ In 16 os Internal Storage ✓ os Hard Clot ✓ 4.5 - 5 Inch Screen ✓ Removable Battery ✗ Buying Moto G 2014 was an amazing deal for me
 him pretty sure I am going to have this phone till 2016 when Android N release and hopefully there will be a Moto G 2016 with far better speck Head 1080p screen more RAM,better Cam,etc) to which all upgrade
 Until then all have fun with my Moto G 2014. 5/5 for this one
 EDIT- One thing I noticed is how fast the battery charges
 It might be fast just for me though since my previous phone was a 2010 Samsung Galaxy Ice and Moto G 2014 is this years model and technology has surely improved tremendous in 4 years
 To me feeling it charges fast might mean nothing to someone who uses latest honest

 I am repenting my decision to select this products
 First time I got this product there were issues of heating and no auto rotation of screen
 Contracted flipkart and I got my phone replaced .
 Again in replaced phone I am facing issues of touch not responding and no auto rotation
 His time flipkart refused to replace my product even if it comes under so claimed "30 DAY REPLACEMENT" warranty
 Worst service by flipkart and waste product from motorola.
 To dont buy any motorola products

Gaurav Pakale
 Which i like the best is sound quality with sterno sound system
 Performance of the phone is great
 only two things will be dis appoint to you that battery back up is very poor you can use only 12-15hrs with one full charge
 and and one is display is not brighter like moto g st genu
 Other wise over all build quality n mobile good
 And worst delivery by os retail and courier service
 I book it on must Act and i receive my parcel on and Love

 I bought this phone from flipkart .
 I ordered it on th december and got it within 12hrs.
 rates the service of FLIPKART.
 To doubt the phone has got everything with this price tags
 But I found two major sons on this phone
 The first one is sometimes the latch up of network is poor for which i am disappointed
 The second thing is that it has poor battery life for which I have to charge the battery twice a day.Even if I dont play games still the battery lasts only unto 4-6hrs.
 Also it takes lots of time to charge the battery(around 4hrs).
 Otherwise,the phone is good
 worth buying it

 In my opinion , this is one of the best Android Shone
 With its 8MP back camera and KitKat OS ( which is getting update to Lollipop) , its totally better than the other smartphones..
 One Drawback The battery life is quite poor when connected to the iii , but its so the case in many other Android Bones took
 To its not a Major Drawback

 The most important thing that any smartphone buyer wants to know that whether it delivers what it promises Moto G and Men does exactly that
 I have used this phone for more than a week now and here what I found Rose - Screen clarity and resolution - Camera quality both front and rear - Unadulterated andros experience - It is fast and is great for multi-tasking - Good shopping experience with Flipkart Sons - Average battery life
 It lasts little less than a day with moderate use - The headset quality looks cheap and fragile

 After reading all reviews about flipkart and Moto go
 I ordered Motog2 on 4 Dec 2014 with urgent delivery
 They delivered me the piece on 5 dec 2014.
 After receiving the hand set when I tried with my Micro him hands is not recognising the him
 I tried with 10 micro aims in both the shots but it is not recognising the him
 When I called to customer care on the same day they said support team will reach me in 24 his but support people reach me on sunday
 They given some trouble shooting steps
 but it not worked out
 I am totally disappointed with the support team and technical team
 I am running behind the people for least exchange of the hands but they are not properly responding
 Really very pathetic for me from the last 4 days
 To option to give zero rating I request all the people make sure that you should not receive a defect piece

 micro os slot Soto Os was not having it Last browsing Multitasking and Smooth Naming thanks to Qualcomm Snapdragon processor West phone under Os 15000.
 It provides Moto Assist which is reloaded in the phone
 Some people wrote about heating issues but I did not find any issues regarding that
 The only con I found is that it requires too much time for charging and average battery life
 Flipkart Service is superb
 Took only 2 days to deliver it
 stars for the phone and star for fast delivery by Flipkart.

 os i purchased this phone about two months ago
 His is indeed an excellent phone for the prices
 want think of any sons yet except for one
 The screen cover broke rather easily
 The drop was rather small from table to ground
 The lcd screen is intact but the glass on top of it broke quite easily and the repair costs about sky
 and suggest buyers opt in for a screen guard and a good causing to protect the phone from these kind of unexpected disasters
 Battery life is oka it lasts about 8 hours with internet etc working and lollipop upgrade should improve upon that
 For the remaining part the phone is excellent for its prices
 Hardly any noticeable bursa and the touch is very smooth
 His phone has given me the best experience so far minus the crack that happened to come up rather easily
 A studies build from motorola would have taken this a lot far certainly

 When i inserted SIM and tried to call i found that Microphone is not working
 Everyday am sending mails to them,but simply they are extending the days without any reply
 To now there is no reply from them
 Maybe after days replacement policy completed they will send mail to me and tell that your days is finished so go to service centre and do it''.
 To please dont buy through flipkart.
 Very worst experience for me

 Its my first product from flipkart and flipkart makes me happy because I got my phone on and morning after ordering at night on with novo
 Vice service by flipkart.
 I am writing the review about moto g and gen after using the phone about 1 months
 Rose 1. 8 up primary and 2 up secondary camera
 Both the camera is capturing nice picture
 Also primary camera works good at night also because of flash light
 2. Front speakers are sterno which will make you feel good while playing games or listening song
 Studio quality is very good even at full volume
 3. I can play heavy games like shalt os call of duty etc without any lagging
 4. Shone connectivity(Network, wife bluetooth) is also good
 I never saw my network fluctuation as other user was mentioning that this phone has some network conductivity problems 5. Battery runs for more than or approve 24 hours if you use normally
 I always use my phone in this way About 3 hours for listening song without headphone, playing game shalt os contract killer for 1 and half hours 2 hours of calling on g network 1 hour what pp 2 hours internet browsing (chrome).
 By phone is 24 hours connected to wife
 Using both him one is g and one is go
 Facebook, what pp email pp linked in services run for 24 hours in background
 Using my phone in this way runs for 24 hours which is pretty good for smartphone.
 6. Gorilla glass is tough.So many time I carried key with my smartphone by mistaken but didn got any scratch
 7. The design of phone is very good
 Its good in hand and it will not slip from your hand because of the bacpanel design
 Sons 1. Basically i dont have any point
 Os i can write only one thing that camera pp can be improved more

 Based on a day of use of moto g and genu everything works smoothly
 The touch is fantastic colors are crisp no lag in playing mid level games camera pictures has some noise in low light photography and battery drain will be fast for hardware user
 Considering its prices it is must buy budget phone

 I received this phone yesterday and the moment I got it I started using it
 However it does not detect the SIM cards
 I had to wait really long and somehow it detected the SIM once
 But then it again lost its communication with the SIM.
 I checked on the internet and discovered that its a common problem faced by most other users of Moto G and also Moto Os
 There is no patch or debut yet available for this problems
 Everything else is amazing
 The phone is fast bright and fun to use
 But what a phone if it doesn recognise the SIM?

 You canst get a better phone for the money on its price range
 Build quality is great solid and Motorola keeps andros pretty much vanilla and stock which is more simple design and easy to use
 The phone its really responsive : stock andros makes it fast and fluid and its upgradeable to the latest andros version (5.0 Lollipop) already
 To LTE (4G) which I dont expect for this price range phone
 Display : 9/10 Battery life : 8 Camera : 8 Case of use : 9 Durability : 9 Design and form factor : 9 Portability : 8 Only reason I didn give it a five is I dont rate much of anything at the very top

 I have ordered moto g 2 gen on the launch day itself
 I got the mobile with defect in him card slot and got replacement.The next one which i got had big defect which i never expect from moto brand....i.e MOTHERBOARD itself dead.Finally i contracted service center in chennai.
 They have blasted a sensational news that they have 10 mobile in queue for mother board change.They said that it will take 2 days for repair
 gets assume how bad it is within 2 days 10 mobile need mother board replacement.If hardware is not good then what the point in using the latest Android software have used this mobile only 2 months
 Even though there is warranty how can customers rotate around service centers unto 1 years
 all never buy mobile from motorola brandy
 May be goose sold motorola to novo because of bad hardware production

 Really it worth the prices
 Awesome looks os does not look like ask phone
 Good battery backup.
 great design .
 Only worrying about the 1.52 SAR value that means high radiation and sometimes call quality is not good enough , Getting hot if you use camera or call for more than 15 mints
 Overall great product os

 MOTO Os Plagued with conductivity issues I bought this phone after my HTC One S was infected with the Helicoptering Huge
 His phone was equal in speck to my previous phone and I could not find anything better in the 10-14k other than this MOTO G and genu
 After a use of few days I found out that the performance of this phone is below expectations
 Shalt 8 does not run in medium graphics it has be in low or the game clashes
 Other high graphics games fare the same way
 Only low graphics games like puzzled and temple run run properly
 The HTC one S played the games in mid and high settings without any issues both the phone are equipped with 1 os ram
 Secondly there are some conductivity issues with the Wi-Fi in this phone
 The hotspot signal drops repeatedly causing other devices to disconnected
 I got this phone replaced 2 twice for this issue but still the issue remains with the rd set
 To asked for a refund for the same
 I was told that the problem was due to Market cut micro him cards
 To checked my phone with 5-6 different aims with no solution of the problems
 There are some issues with the touch also... a lot of times I could not type the letters on the side of the screen.... Overall the phone is good for moderate gazing display also good battery life is decent but if you use wife gathering then you are going to face conductivity issues
 i decided to go for a red os for now will upgrade later
 ( the old aims creating problems with MOTO G and are working fine with the 1S) But Buds to Flipkart for its service , really top notch
 I cannot expect this kind of service from local shops also
 i got 2 replacement sets and finally a refund
 5 Star rating to flipkart.

 His is first time I find myself dejected while purchasing from flipkart.
 I have ordered for two For g black model
 One for me and one for my sister
 First I have received the black model with white accessories.
 When I have inquirer about the same great flipkart executive done the blunder and cancel
 The order which iv placed for my sister
 When iv called second time then they understood the problem and then reinstate the order
 After that they said they can not replace my product as it is from Mototral shipped it and as May be black accessories have been existed they might have sent white one
 I wondered is it the quality expected from flipkart and Motorola or they have taken it for granted as we r purchasing from webster
 That is why regulating these e shop is required

 After 15 days using this mobile i feel andros one mobile is better than this mobile lag is there sometimes apes are getting stuck & crashing and that to i am not installed any games
 i am installed unto 20 Pp only
 even it is getting stuck and lag in the mobile
 battery performance is also not good need to plug in to lawton in officer
 if your using Os on in you mobile 24 os means need to charge two times daily it only get 12 H or 15 H only very poor battery performance
 for full charge more than two hours it need
 another bad thing is,when your in one call if you received any other call then if you pressed hold and talk new call then old call is dropped it is not continuous
 him signal strength is also not good i have another mobile andros mobile in both the mobile same no aims are there in moto go i am not receiving any calls i am able to receive call in andros one mobile
 Available RAM also not good
 after installed few apes it is showing 180 os available
 performance is not good that time
 coming to camera 8 MP, but performance is not that much good it looks more than 5MP only not before 8 MP.
 i think lip part only is giving hip to this mobile only but really it is not a good mobile
 Us please think one more time to buy this mobile and up to you my opening this is not best deal

Puneet Sharma
 His is the best phone that you can buy in the money offered thou it is not a great camera phone but I would still rate it 7/10 in that field
 But it expel in the performance field as it comes with 0 bloatware and this makes the phone work effortlessly smooth and non sluggish
 Wont expect a flagship killer in this price but sure it is the best mobile in the market considering its price and frequent updates.The build quality is also good but the design is too old and you may not like it
 Quality of charger is superb no USB cable in the box and headphone is too cheap
 Buy it if you want a non sluggish and non pre-installed application phone with pure goose experience
 Nothing more

 Wouldn find the zero rating The product is good there is no doubt about that
 The customer service is the worst
 Screen stopped working properly with no crack or anything outside
 The service center defined the problem as physical damaged
 There was no physical damage on the screen
 Anything happened was internal
 They charged me Os 7000.
 They took 2 weeks as of today
 They still did not give me the products
 I tried contracting motorola care
 They responded after a week with no proper answers
 I contracted the service center today and they said no electricity today so cannot respond to my queries(I'm not kidding).
 PS: Credit for moto care as they said They could understand my feelings

 His set very nice in comparison with other bands like samsung, Gumma act
 But only one problem in this one is this mobile is wont support for direct Os calling from him and this is the only drawback of this mobile
 if you want to make Os video calling you need to make through Apps.
 Accept this every thing is fine
 Battery back is about oh without using of Os chats light weight looking smart in hands and technically it is good with 12, 999 prices

 os People are saying most of the times they are not readable on my number.(Heard
 the similar issue from other moto G and gen users
 so when you feel like some thing wrong the remedy is start start restart... then only people can reach you
 2)Its 2GB ram with good processor but hangs clot !!! Wont understand what RAM and processor upon
 3)And the funny moto support : when ever you reach them simple response do the ache clean up bah bah reset.... Hats it
 Final Word : Unhappy with market hoped phone

 And on top of that whichever discard I insert into and sloth range is fluctuating pathetically sometimes it does not show the range at all it does not catch Os range
 I called customer care every time they are arranging call back from from technical team but there is no facility to talk directly with Technical Beams
 It is wasting my time

 I have been using this phone for last few months and its awsm.
 Moto phone are best in its price range no other brand can stand in any comparison
 Hardware is best looks are slim and stunning latest andros updated guaranteed no extra bloatwares, in built software are very useful and of fine qualities battery back is great camera is way too stunning front sterno speakers are the best in class and performance never hangs best optimization of memory and processor screen and touch are mind blowing you have the option of different colors replaceable back-covers original moto brandy that suits or style
 The only con I found is the charger is of low power but u can have high power charger from market and get rapid charging
 To the bottom line os its the best phone among the ones i used within ask price brackets
 him loving it os go fr it without thinking twice

 Flipkart sent me a used device
 its quite clear from the packing and condition of the device
 Someone spends his hard earned money to buy a brand new phone and guess what flipkart sends a used device which was returned by someone else
 The charger doesn fit into any indian wall socket seems to be bent probably the guy who used it before me damaged it
 I am done with flipkart.
 Last time they sent me a used watch and now this
 Off to amazon and bay

 I was not confident to buy phone online and always went to a store to purchase phone fearing warranty and service issues
 In facing multiple issues with my previous Gumma phone under 1 year and being denied warranty really bad service from one of the well known retail outlet of Haney
 I felt taking the risk of buying online was worth a try
 Research and Looking : Windows phone was a sure "NO" with my past Microsoft & dealer experience
 I had vast choice when i stepped into deciding on which Andriod phone
 Decided on a budget of 15 K and started searching
 ASUS Zenphone 5 was cheaper and an option i was willing to try
 Due to the larger size and lower sound quality served into booking Moto G and Men Delivery and Packaging: Must admit Flipkart delivery much before ETA os days delivered in 2 days
 The Packaging was good and it was a fresh piece
 Shone Usage Review : Initial few days faced a bit of trouble due to twitching from Windows to Android.
 In 2 days was able to adjust and the Android experience is very good though graphically you may miss the windows interface
 Very Good sound and call quality
 Camera is decent
 The phone build feels strong and solid buttons are sturdy the rubber back also gives better grip
 Battery life is also very good with approve of 4 his of con calls + what pp + 10 - 15 mind gaming + reading some stuff online the battery still had 40 % remaining
 Would recommend this phone to any user looking for Android phone under 15 Os

 The phone has lost its display
 I can hear it ring but can not see any display
 His happened with in 30 days of purchase
 I took the phone to Moto service center for checkup.
 They suggested to get it replaced as there will be repairs involved and the phone is still in 30 day replacement period
 I requested for replacement on with Sov 2014 with Flipkart.
 Flipkart notified that i will be receiving a call from their executive with in 2 days and then further process will be initiated
 Its been 5 days since then and there is no contact being made by Flipkart.
 I called the Flipkart customer care multiple times
 They have been asking me to wait for he call Of not today you will receive it tomorrow
 He are prioritizing the issue
 His is the best we can do
 It is very frustration to keep waiting for a call to get the product replaced
 Flipkart has a market image of customer friendly approach but such actions will varnish your image

 Os a former shone user I am very pleased with how my first andros phone has functioned.
 The battery is extremely longer than my old shone os and the screen is very big
 The phone is very light compared to other phone with the same screen size and the speakers are very good
 I like the dual him feature although I do not use it
 Overall this phone is an amazing product made by motorola and I have found that the only down side to this phone is that sometimes it will hang so I would advise you not to get too many large applications

 His is my st review
 have been using this phone since with September
 after 2 and half months of usage can tell you everything about this phone First of all would like to thank os retail for this products
 Now I wont talk here about specs(because you can read it in the product description).I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE.
 West things 1.HD screen is classic.Delivers sharp image and texts 2.Stereo speakers are very nice
 3.Due to round edge,it is very easy to handle 4.Rear Camera is also nice.Some details get missed in photos but overall its a nice camera
 5.Battery life is good(except while playing heavy games 6.The Shone looks really smart os 7.SD card support is appreciable
 Average things 1.Front Camera is bad.(looks
 live 1.3 Began pixels) Worst things:1.Due to 1 os of RAM,,the phone laws often while multi-tasking(1.2
 z quand core is nice,but RAM should have been at-least 1.5 GB).I am a phone-lover( I have used Galaxy S4,my fathers shone act Nexus and therefore I can surely say that os WILL os A MAJOR ISSUE.,because
 RAM matters the most while multi-tasking.
 Verdict:Overall it is a good phone,but at the same price,asus zenfone 5 (16 GB) is available,which has 2 os RAM(and all the things exactly the same will be a better buy.Don't think that I am saying this only looking at the specs.My room-mate has Zenphone which has nearly EVERYTHING better than this(except Battery life
 motif you want to buy this phone and will upgrade it next earthen there no problem.But if you are planning to buy a phone that will last for least 2 years,then Believe merge for Zenphone 5.

 i buy this phone on flipkart..all features are very good but having some problem like whenever we use wife or g network for watching video on couture its
 taking long time for suffering compare to other phone having same specification
 In other phones,online video play smoother without suffering on wife / g network
 and main issue is phone is getting hang on some games like subways suffer,this is very disappointing from Motorola.because
 this phone having best specification but its still getting hang
 rd main issue is battery life its take his for full charging but battery discharging very fast Disappointing battery life

 I just dont know if am I the only person who got buggy products even replacing the product for 2 times!!!
 Not satisfied with the product screen heat up I have replaced the products for 2 times but still the problems like heating and low speaker quality The phone hangs up for a while when getting back to home screen phone also gets slow with closing and opening the apes the phone has a pure version of andros but still it lags!!! Camera Quality is Awesome, slo-mo is superb but performance in speed and utilization of the OS is not that good motorolla should improve a lot... coming to the speakers of the phone when i keep it on the full volume it gets shattering... when its new it works fine but after 2 days it ll begin... very disappointed with the phone
 so os but Flipkart your awesome!!! Delivery in time replacement with that grantee... so for you * * * * * Motorola please improve the quality and one more things the back cover get lose after removing for about 4-5 times.... it might sound stupid to mention but for a college guy like me it is annoying that my phone cover has a gap or not perfect fit!!!

 Everything works well with this phone except one things
 That is when the battery drops to below 20% the top portion of the phone gets heat up and I can feel my ear gets heat up while talking at such a low battery power
 Also I have read reviews of many people complaining about the charger that heat up while charging
 Line is fine and works well

 I placed order for moto g and gen in the month of october and i didn received any product i somewhat ordered it on with of october i think soothe delivery was going to be on with of october but i didn receive any delivery on 30 th of october i canceled it on th of november via customer care case i didn find any option of concealing on page of flipkart webster the customer care then requested me to place order again so i just placed an order again on 11 th of november i got that product which was going to be delivered on with of october i just didn take that product and the next day i got my product which i ordered on th of november i opened the box i turned on the phone and what i found is the phone defective there was no voice outdoing command so this time i ordered for replacement and there was going to be a pick up on22nd of november but no pick up took place and then they promised me that pick up will be within with of november but none come to my home for pick up and the customer care told that it will be pick up in within 3 days.im
 very upset with flipkarts delivery couriers does it really take more than one month for a product to be delivered in working states
 And the flipkart scatters they themselves canceled my replacement now will not buy any product from flipkart

 One star for good mobile os for making everyone fool -_-

 I like this smartphone very much it is really impressive Moto G is amazing phone
 camera quality is good in low light and front facing Camera also good no black clear view
 audit quality is wonderful support iron man 3 and if 2014 many more games excellent to play in this mobile
 but there are some cost 1. Headphones supplied are of low quality
 2. Charger does not come with detachable USB cable 3. USB cable not provided in the kit
 4.Phone starts heating up after continuous use os Shone take long time to charge completely
 Ultimately a good deal for this prices

 The features offered in this phone meets the expectation considering its price tags
 There are few sons for the phone but the overall performance is good
 Gros : 1. good camera
 2. stylish design
 it feels good when i hold it in my hand
 3. the front sterno speakers are an asset to this phone 4. there is no lag when i play games
 I did not try high end games
 But Shalt 8 airborne stopped working after playing first level
 Things that can be improved 1.
 The battery is not so great
 It lasts for 1 day with very minimal usage
 2. I have trouble with the dual him settings
 Sometimes the signal for secondary him goes down
 It can only be restored by starting the phone
 3. Some of the high end games like Shalt 8 Airborne wont run
 They will crash after sometimes
 Of not for the dual him problems I would have rate this 5 stars

Archan Pagedar
 The mobile is very sleek and fast enough to run any pp or game
 I have been using this mobile for 2 months and haven faced any problem with it
 Not andros updated as soon as i connected to wife
 It accepts micro aims only so I had to cut my 2 him cards before starting using them
 Camera and sound is not so good
 I get 6 os instead of 8 os while using picture ratio of 16:9.
 Display screen is sharp but in sunlight it is not very bright
 That maybe because I use auto brightness
 Battery life is average
 Once fully charged it lasts at least for a day while using internet and games
 It takes at least 3 hours to get fully charged from fully discharged states
 But overall battery life is better than most other mobile I have seen
 The mobile speed got little slower when I installed many apply but it got smoother again after removing unnecessary apply

 I got 4 replacement phone & finally got fed-up with the product & decided no more
 Experience illustrated below to the prospective buyers of Moto G2. - The first oh had burning smell from the charging socket area of the the
 Submitted complaint & replacement oh was shipped in a weeks
 - The second oh charger got put after 3 weeks when i requested for a replacement charger os said they will not be able to provide original Moto charge
 They gave me an option to buy a compatible charge but why should i compromise - what if the oh performance gets effected
 os made me wait & tested my patience for long
 They took close to 3 weeks to call and speak – and the rep who called was very rude & said he will process the refund – keep the phone & all other accessories intact for picked without being polite and having patience to listen to me
 Now I had to be firm – said you are not the decision maker – I have paid for it & so will it reside on me to decide what I want
 Informed him to make arrangement for replacement the
 The was delivered in days from the date of request
 PS: His the also had burning smell from the oh charging socket
 Os one of my friend oh also had the same kind of experience – we kept quite & started living with it
 - The Third the
 His one was working fine thankful no issues but after 2 weeks the oh started showing its infrequent tantrums.
 When i receive a call from the contact in my the
 i dont get their name on the display when i get a call sometime display screen use to be white in color - when i get oncoming call
 Not the the
 rest to factory mode but didn help
 Submitted a request for return - os advised to rest the the to factory mode
 Again it didn help they agreed to replaced
 I was shocked when they agreed for a replacement so easy
 Why no dram like the last time to delay in agreeing to provide a replacement phil Felt something fish but i was happy & ignored - assuming it was may be one of the odd customer service rep experience the last time
 The fourth the It was delivered in two days
 The day when it arrived – my brother for whom I had bought this oh – was very upset with the first os product that he had bought & the awful experience
 He use to always be against buying products from online He kept fussing with me I told you……..?
 He spoke to the delivery guy & tried to make communication with him while he was verifying the return product & the box
 Brother – Was os been receiving quite a lot complaints for MOTO Os the & until now I have returned 3 phil what do you guns do with the returned ph.,?” Delivery Buy Eyes sir – there are quite a lot complaints about this oh model
 Air - When the customer returns the defective products os seller will fix those problems and retell them to customers again – if they dont retell then they will be in loss sir
 They have to close the shop & sit at home By brother was shocked to hear that from the os delivery person
 That about the notice os puts at the bottom of the page of every products
 Please Note All products sold on Flipkart are brand new and 100% genuine 1.With all fear & fingers crossed – my brother opened the pack switched on the the 2.
 He experienced white light lines on the either sides of the screen 3. Display quality & color was dull 4. Took a picture from camera lot of grains on the picture even without booming
 5.
 You will notice rainbow colors on the display for few seconds when you get an oncoming call
 6. Drop in calls when you are out on the street inspire of having full network
 7. Hearing speaker would fumbled
 The above experience & reasons in the last three months were enough to decide for taking a refund instead of a replacement the
 A very sick experience & os using such blackjack tactics to make business
 SHAME os YOU os & os RETAIL

 Flipkart Service - I just received the product today and the product has been working fine till now but looking the mobile box the pen marks on it 3 different product tape tags referring to the number of times it has been used and returned by customers I have to say that though the phone is working great till now I am huge disappointed with Flipkart.
 Wont really know when it might need a replacement
 1 star for Flipkart.
 Earphones - The earphones are of really poor quality and the left apiece has already started giving issues but really looking at its quality its meant to last for a few days only

 New Gros and sons – from my perspective Os am not heavy user with gaming and graphics requirement but mainly use for internet and for calls with longer duartions) Gros • Good Display and build Right weight • Recent Camera Quality • Good battery back up • Have not observed laws yet
 • Received software update from moto after week 21.11.23 Sons • Speaker quality is not so good With headphones on – can hear continuous little hissing buzzing noise – Also tried with all headphones this is really annoying
 • After receiving calls speakers gives little shedding crackling noise in between
 • Fig To for listening music with ordinary headphones comes along with pack
 • Not sure its latest software version or what - internet browsing became very slow with latest Email 5.0 and Home installation Os have tried with multiple network provides • Flipkart Delivery Service was good but response from customer service was not up to the mark received different information every time called for shipping status
 Customer helpless Service!’ – long way to go from here

 1.You can save a number with special character like(*141#) if u go by call log
 2.All message information will not show in a userfriendly way
 3.No default Mile Manager
 4.Battery draining so fast

 While on call if you press a number by mistaken no way to delete that

 For a ask phone no data cable

 It just brings a bad name to it

 The phone gets heated up for no reason
 Even if it is not being used it gets heated up slightly
 I thought it was an issue with the launched and I was using Aviate.
 Even after twitching back to Google Now launched the issue persists
 While attending calls the top portion of the phone gets heated up so bad and pretty quickly
 Also the battery gets drained quickly
 It doesn last a day on moderate use
 A friend of mine is also having these issues
 Otherwise it is a good phone at this price tags

 I was excited to buy moto G and gen when it got released to market
 In there come big billion day,then without a thought i ordered from flipkart.
 Excellent service got the product in 2days,after using it for 1 week i found there is some problem with the software and battery charging ....i went for replacement
 Not the replacement as usual with in 2 days,but this time i figured that the colour brightness was not up to the expected i can feel the difference in color since the mobile i used first time is crystal clear in terms of color,but the replaced one is worst Immediately after the product got delivered with in 30 minutes i went for another replacement
 Flipkart as usual good response and good service but the rd piece i got was also having the same problem of color deficient
 I checked with my colleague mobile of same model i can see my mobile color brightness is dull......It is like same as and piece .....now i got compromised with the product...because of bored trying for one more replacement and no guarantee that i will get the best product......I'm tired of exchanging one more time even though i had a chance for replacement........! I am not against flipkart because i love their services and customer response as well as they give 100% for their customers.......but i just want to share my reviews on the product so that people of my kind will think before they buy this product.....I even dont blame os retail as well...because i got many products from the same seller...they did a fantastic job in replacing every time i ask for.......whom to blame then.....is it MOTOROLA company who manufactured these kind of products...! But a big loss for me is that i brought this product for an exchange of my samson mobile for 2k-----many people in my office told you sold it for very cheap prices they are ready to pay 3 to 4 k for my old mobile this makes me really embarrassed...... !

 Not of Good features but Battery is where it disappoints , could have been better
 Looks like all Mobile manufacturers have decided to leave 1 or two stitches in their fantastic products for customers to go through some pain
 I still like it in terms of Audio,Video,Camera, All features for the prices it is good

 Yeah Of you dont bother about battery then you should go ahead and buy this phone
 Once still get updated to Andriod 5 (Lolipop) will be able to know how this phone survives in current Market os

 wont get deceived by the configuration numbers , Shone build is poor .
 Of the Price Justified that , the support service afterwards will make you realise that you are handling a low class phone .
 By phone started to get an issue with the receiver / head piece just after th week .
 And have been asked to visit the service centre for the and time within 2 months .
 And dont be surprised if the service centre in your locality is overcrowded and ask you to submit the phone for 2 weeks and not even to call to enquire before 12 days , and then fails to fix your issue
 Of you are looking a secondary phone or a phone to gift to some one who doesn have much dependency on it and has plenty of time to worry about it , His is the one for you

 The flash is good
 The screen display is very good and perfect
 The battery is poor
 You need to charge it everyday and if you saw a lot of video then u would have to charge it in 7 to 8 hours
 The overall performance is very good
 The camera is excellent

 I have placed the order yesterday for this handset, and got it delivered by this afternoon.However, the product seems to be severely defective
 Touch screen does not respond at all
 Part from the start and volume buttons nothing seems to be working in this handset.
 When contracted the customer care they say the technical team would call me within with of November i.e., within 3 days from now
 Trusting flipkart, I bought this handset.
 I have replaced the regular him to micro him also
 And I have to be disconnected from the world till their technical team calls up

 There is a spot on the display since I received this products
 Os per Flipkart Return Policy I requested for return of the item and a new piece to be delivered but unfortunately the request was rejected biting that few troubleshooting steps that would solve the problem but to no avail while nothing worked
 Flipkart is so far just extending the date for solving the issue rather than actually solving it on ground
 His is not fair extending the TAT thrice intending to complete the 30 days so that the customer canst Request Return again is it
 I have been a valued customer for Flipkart so far
 Would request to check my Order history
 I have ordered about half a dozen Moto G phone
 I have got one more Moto G order to place but kept it on hold till this problem is fixed

Sachin Kamble
 There are already so many things been said about this device and I have nothing new to add to it
 I actually bought it for a friend and he really liked it to the core
 The only drawback being lack of moto service centres
 Moto should really work on having their own service stations and it will encourage more people to buy their honest
 Overall it is a genuine product with high end hardware and specie
 Full value for money

 Gros -5" display front speakers are loud n clear no network or call drops -8MP camera takes amazing pictures when HDR mode is on micro os slot up to 32gb bones there were no bones in the device whatsoever but the charger shipped with this phone heat up like a often rocky

 its an excellent phone no doubt
 Have been using it for 2 months and found it very good

 Overall the phone is excellent
 commendable job done by MOTO

 I ordered the phone on Ri idea 21/11 and rev it on 24/11.
 I have not used much to write the review but according to me this cell phone is AWSM..
 I order micromax Micro from Amazon it was also good 1 issue happened in NITRO was when battery reached 50% within 2 hours the cell phone switches off
 West everything was oka
 It happened 2 times with me so i returned the phone and received the refund
 When i booked MOTO Os
 The touch is simply amazing Built is also good
 It is not too heavy light then Nitro.
 i use cell phone for Whatsapp, FB, All n sometimes SMS.
 I dont play games
 To i can use the phone for more than 24 hours in a single go without charging
 By recommendations would be go for it os

 Now while buying this phone...I had to choose bow this and the zenphone 5.Ultimately I chose this
 here the hands on pro and sons Rose 1.Nice, Fig display 2.LIght.Like, real light used the moto e be and compared to that this feels like a leaf 3.Pretty smooth.Good enough for regular use
 4.Cool matter finish screen guard came free Sons 1.Battery Life-getting around 6 his 2.Camera....doeant work wonders....but good enough for or average series and photos the front speakers hate this new design.The old Moto g looked more solid due to their absence
 result:if u are looking for a phone that u can upgrade to lollipop, that has got a decent camera and looks nice then go for it

 The battery is the lifetime of any phone especially if it were to be a smartphone.
 The battery on the Os really needs to be recalled and motorola should be replacing them
 Key observations os Takes around 4 hours to get 100% charged
 os Battery life poor and lasts for 5-6 hours os Turn on bluetooth & wife and the battery drains even faster

 i purchased this phone from flipkart.it's
 delivered in 1 day.cheap
 price,cheap service,cheap phone need to install many applications in order to do anything.One VERY VERY IMPORTANT THING..i would like to tell u is no conference call facility which is available in a phone which cost u 2,000.Can anybody explain why its available only on flipkart i will explain..it's all marketing strategy of motorola..if they will sell in market..all rumors will be spread soon and then no body will buy this phone.In some phone call waiting is not working it not in my cases called Motorola customer care...they have no knowledge at all...Motorola care is open from morning 9 to evening 9 it if u go with any phone of samsung...service is excellent...product is excellent...customer care executive are very excellent and they keep cracking or problem till or problem gets resolved..if u face any problem with samson what u need to do is just call once and raise a complain...they will resolve instantly or they will get back to u with proper solution.In motorola phone..it is very difficult to move contact and all data from old phone but Of u go with samsung...they have proper software to do it but moto have no software at all would like to suggest u guns that if u want good product and good service then dont look just for attractive features ....Go with samson which has best product with best service which i ever has experienced

 Due to battery I am 3 star rating Experience with Flipkart was excellent

 I bought Moto G (2nd) form flipkart webster on 9 September 2014.
 It started showing some touch related problems within 35 days from purchase and its touch stopped working completely on 25 Act 2014 without any external damaged
 I submitted my phone to Motorola Authorized Service Enter in Dehradun, after keeping my phone for 3 weeks they told me that touch of my phone was working fine and it had some motherboard issue
 After confronting them why it too so long to discover the problem they started making lame excuses and started blaming one another
 Also Service Enter was located in very dingy and dark place and employees handling the customers were very unprofessional.
 Os i had lost trust in the Engineers who were handling the phone I contracted the senior officials to provide some proper solution to my problems
 They assured me to ship a new phone but it has been week and a half and haven heard from them regarding how and when it will be shipped
 To please before buying this phone kindly remember their service center support is really bad especially in Dehradun).
 PS: I have to give 1 star rating in order to submit my review but from my side its negative

 Os Con's: heating up using camera ,games,wifi) 2. sometimes lagging in playing high end games (asphalt 8,nfs most wanted,dead trigger no data cable in the box
 poor quality head phone in the box
 5.Battery draining very fast ( using games,wifi,bluetooth in mind
 battery talk time will be from am to pm regular usage with out internet and games But overall at this price point this branded mobile is good to use .
 I recommend to people before buying this mobile order one earphone and datacable.(power

Parag Vade
 telling the truth I was about to cancel this order 2 hours before the delivery of my moto g 2. The reason is I was not able to decide between Moto G 2 and Us Zenfone 5(16gb).
 Both phone are prices at exactly same amount that is 12999.
 Talking about the facts zenfone 5 packed with 1.6 z intends dual core processor which actually can perform like 4 virtual comes when needed plus its 2 go RAM, this comb perform better as compared to Moto G and genu
 But that doesn mean Moto G 2 is way behind the performance of zenfone.
 Reason is Moto runs stock andros which saves lot of memory providing you the best andros experience
 Moto can run almost all games confine can
 Were are they key points which made me choose moto g and gen over zenfone and I am 100% happy with my choice 1. Battery back way better than zenfone.
 Have been using it since some days and it lasts all day long that what I needed
 compared to zenfone it gives back of hardly 6-7 his 2. Stock andros means the best andros experience 3. Once of the first phone to receive andros L update 4. Splash resistant screen 5.
 It is all round in true sense

 MOTO G and Generation is bigger & better at the unfordable pricking
 It ha a decent design & looks which doesn give you a sucking plastic feel like others
 Display is nice with decent viewing angle but could had been perfect with a full os display
 its also a good performance wise because its a stock andros device
 It plays high graphics games like Shalt 8 , Modern Combat 5 & Head Trigger 2 smoothly courtesy its 1.2 z Qulacomm processor supported by 1 os of RAM .
 It comes with 16 os built for storage
 His time u can expand the storage with external memory card up to 32 GB.
 It has a 8 os rear camera which does a decent job & doesn disappoint in low light with led flash light front facing camera is of 2MP which will be sufficient for self lovers
 West about Moto devices is that it receive Android updated easily before other smartphones.
 Recommended for all those looking for a looking for a smartphone under ask & who want a pure andros performance

 First of all Flipkart, awesome job
 Ordered the product on Saturday night and it got delivered by Sunday noon canst get any faster than that!!! Secondly about the phone itself I am not so good with writing long reviews all all say is this phone delivers an excellent performance at a price point which justified it!!! To for it if your probably a first time Android buyer or even a user who doesn care too much about all the being features which you may never end up using
 You will surely not be disappointed both with performance or the hardware quality

 I am a complete Motorola fan right from the time it was a sole company to it becoming a Google brand and now Lenovo...
 I personally own the Moto Os Moto E and now the Moto Os I own this pp of great update since almost 4 months now and I have already got it replaced 2 times with the third request already under process
 There is genuinely no concern with this model in fact it is an answer to lot of concerns faced by competing brand honest
 The only reason I have had to keep getting replacement for it is the display screen
 In all three occasions the display screen has had the same issue
 And the issue is the display screen on the volume rocket side is a bit raised above the main phone body due to which there is a thin gap which emit the illumination form the display from the side of the phone
 His seems to be the concern with all the three pus that I have had my hands on making it look more like product batch issue
 Having all this said Flipkart guns have been super understanding and of great technical assistance over this issue every-time.
 Really buds to you guns
 Not easy keeping up the standard to the "T", consistently
 Final verdict To for this product even if you have a super humorous budget and can go fancy buying an expensive phone
 Because you cannot beat the futuristic approach that Motorola had before it sold itself to Google, with any other brandy
 Must a word of caution as soon as you receive this product check for the screen
 Of any concern contact Flipkart immediately
 I am sure they would be more than glad to assist you on the same
 Those 3 stars they belong to you guns @ flipkart!!

 I got this after 1 day of ordering thanks to flipkart.I have been using this phone for almost two months and uphill now my experience with it was good but not excellent
 I played some heavy games on it ashplat 8 and it hanged on me couple of times.dont
 know what the problem wasn other aspects the phone is outstanding
 The interface is almost same as nexus mobile thanks to stock android.Google tie with motorola is working good as the experience is the the same you can get on some ask honest
 Camera-good but in low light it gets a little shaggy
 Speaker-dual front speaker do their joy perfectly
 Screen-big and nice Standby-not that good works only for half day
 Interface-awesome can be better Ram-didnt got hanged uphill now.but
 laws a little big software and games
 Overall-no doubt a must buy phone at 13k.great at this price ranges
 buy it if you can go for an ask phone
