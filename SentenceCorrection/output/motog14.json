 Although the phone is good,the screen is too fragile,it broke completely after I dropped it from a pocket height and moreover motorola is reluctant to replace it in warranty.Unsatisfied with the services and build quality

 His is the best choice in this price range
 Pain reason to chose Moto G is for battery backup.
 Even though Zenphone has go ram under 10000 price tags It lacks in battery backup.
 I have been using this for the past 2 weeks
 Overall satisfied with the performance as well as camera quality
 It has big 5 inch screen with superb build quality and design
 Such satisfied with the battery

 I was very happy with the product i bought it 3 months back
 Early this month somehow it want footing and i came to know the motherboard has crashed
 Luckily in warranty period I got the motherboard replaced
 just 3 days back i got my phone back and here now i am writing this review
 The primary camera is not working properly
 Its giving blurred images
 Some issue with the auto focus
 I spoke to Motorola customer support the personal suggested me to do factory rest
 I had to do the whole procedure again
 And i am again back to the square one
 Once again i spoke to the moto customer care they asked me to take it to the service centre
 Why do i have to make rounds of the service centre every now and then
 It was working properly before giving for servicing, I find here that these are some workmen whom motorola has given authority and they are not exclusively for Motorola.
 I DON'T TRUST os GIVE os PHONE os THESE SERVICE CENTRES AGAIN.
 But i am left with no option
 Somehow i could claim for my money back
 and I wish I knew this before

 The phone got delivered within 3 days which is always earlier than the estimated time in my area
 Overall the phone is very good to hold and in performance but the one I received had a bright spot near the centre of the screen which was clearly visible on lighter background
 I asked for replacement of the product but first Flipkart customer service failed me some troubleshooting steps of fixing dead pixels, but it did not work
 I dont think the spot is due to dead pixels.
 After telling them again they accepted the return and schedule it for delivery till th Hang Thanks to Flipkart for helping me out
 him eagerly waiting for the phone and will write a complete review after I receive the final products

Tom Pallissery
 The phone is impressively sharp for such low cost and beats most of the mid-range phone I would say
 The only area I found disappointing was the brightness area
 It is a bit lower than other phone in its price category
 want comment on the battery life as of now but it has gone pretty strong for the past 6 his of my moderate usage
 Commenting on flipkart delivery it was awesome, got it delivered with still 5 days remaining for the due date
 (Wasn't so happy about the packing thought
 Protection was meager but could do with it no worries Definite recommendations from my side for both the moto go and flipkart.

 List I have been using micromax canvas 2 A110 for three years I know what is the bad quality products
 That Shone was bad and slow so I got exchange offer I switched it with this GEM.
 I have used Nexus os Grand 2 and Grand 1 for two days each
 I think Grand 1 and 2 is no where in competition with this phone
 Battery is same to canvas so I know how to use this new phone but it is almost 24 he still battery running on If And whatsapp.
 I am not heavy user
 but still In office wife is connected for 8 his this phone survived easily
 Screen is vive 295ppi.
 camera is awesome, slow mo 720p is perfect
 Shone is delicate i dont know why but I can But my phone even in Pocket Os now buttons for value lock key are decent
 Now the call quality things you have to set the volume to 50% or anyone can listen to your call
 If Signal catching is in good range
 Dual speakers are same if you set on high volume sound will crack but set it on 80% I have used only for 24hr I will update after every one week month and six months just to help some of my fellow out there who are reading and get confused about what to buy in budget range cause budget is big thing for us 5 stars for phone display,camera.
 Used this phone for more more than 10 days it is working well pictures are clear
 battery back up is for more than one day for me wife 24 he even in office and home+low brightness whole time
 head phone are cheap quality but why the charger and headphones are white
 I dont understand the concept
 I already have the skullcandy headphones working well with this device
 I will update after one months
 Will now the best of the best
 Used it for months now I have started using more more brightness and high end gaming with graphics
 All is set for 12 hours ( full time wife on and 40% screen brightness ) phone is bit slow while twitching to apes while playing games
 Battery is kind of drawback but screen resolution pick are amazing
 Will update after months
 18/02/2015 Shone is working well
 Awesome hats off to moto for 5.0.2 updated

 I bought this phone on word November and got it on with and I was pretty happy about it
 It seemed like a good phone at the moment but then came the problems
 Of I would use any type of screengaurd my touch screen would start to act funny
 I hated tit
 was also pretty slow
 I ordered for a replacement and got it within 1 day
 The new one did not seem to have any problems
 But the screen turned yellow and the buttons went inside the body
 I got it refused and bought a note 3 neo
 I am really happy with the note experience
 And the battery for me parts one and a half days and best of all it has no problems

 I Beams His was the worst experience ever i have had with filpkart, I had processes an order on word Dec for a phone MotoG2, on exchange offer through my mobile application from standard chartered credit cards Order no:-OD201618115386931100.
 I processes this order when i was traveling i ordered this phone for my uncle & by mistake i had but his incomplete mobile number 09890581865, i forgot the last digit 5 to enter while placing the order Now the delivery was expected by the st Hang Now today when i checked my email i got a mail from flipkart that my order was canceled without me being aware of it & i spoke to Pranay, Until Took & everyone easily hung up the phone on me
 Until being a manager hung up that was strange
 They said they couldn help & i will have to replace the fresh order & the same offer is no longer available
 Now as a customer try and understand how i would feel agreed that the mobile number was incorrect but the email os was correct an email could have been sent that please contact us in 48hrs or 72hrs since we are not able to get in touch with you due to your incorrect mobile number & i you dont contact your order will be cancelled".
 Father than directly concealing my order
 Now my request was to help me place the same order again as a human error of tying can always be there & i as a customer had already made the payment & had never asked for the order to be canceled
 Hope somebody considers this mistake & helps me because as of now my perception is Flipkart does not requires customers and thinks only they sell mobile honest
 But any company should always think the are there because of the customers

Manoj Khare
 have used this phone for the past 3 months now and reading all the reviews already would only speak of pro & sons for me
 The product : Causes Good call quality & nice speakers Recent camera for outdoor Doesn crash or freeze as my Gumma used to
 Battery life of ~20 his with calls of 30-45 mind wife on 10 his rest on 3G, social media usage email checking & game playing of maybe 20 min Useful apes out of the box Sinuses Camera for indoor/low light photos Screen shows blotch red and faded blue GPS first fix takes a very long time ~6-8 min a big minus for me Charging time is high at os his
 But at this prices and buy it again not the brilliant Zenfone os which is as good/better in some areas except 2 - I found Moto G a bit easier to hold and use singlehandedly, the battery life is better than Asus, with the better screen being Us USP over Moto Os Now about FK.
 I was a bit disappointed to wait for 8 days for delivery as the status messages showed the phone was stuck in transit for the most part
 To be fair os did say 10-12 days at the time of the order however I suppose have cotton used to FK's superfast delivery
 Still FK's customer service was good as always on pointing out the delay they got the delivery expedite

 Moto G and Men not worth.product
 quality is worst
 heating issues during call and all application installed via goose play gets corrupted and photos stored in os card gets delete automatically replaced the product 1 times and finally returned the product to Flipkart.
 Please cautious before buying
 Moto E was far better when compared to Moto G and genu
 Camera clarity depends on phone to phone.it was worst in the replace moto g than the earlier one

 Previously I owned Moto G st Men which is the best budget phone of 2013 and now I feel happy and proud to have the West budget phone of 2014.. Moto G and Men
 Were are the pro and sons of the phone
 Gros os The phone is slim and easy to carry The phone has a good battery backup.
 The look of the phone is awesome and the curved edges makes easy to handle the phone
 The speakers are loud enough and gaming experience is awesome....
 It is upgradable to the latest Android L "Lollipop" and Motorola claims that it will always provide the latest andros to the phone Sons os I have used this phone for Two months and till date I didn find any problem in the phone.... Description os The phone is awesome and there were no issues till now when I was using my phone...
 I suggest this phone for the cadet weeks and its the best budget phone ever !!!! Buds to Motorola !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Great low light pictures some better than my Cannon IXUS.
 To stopped carrying my camera
 Battery is lasting two days for me which is better than my previous os L9.

 I bought a Motorola Moto G and genu
 phone and as the one month passed i begin to face several issues like hanging Whatsapp not working properly and most severe issue was mid was not working properly
 When i contracted FLipkart they refused to take any action as they said one month has passed and act to their policy they only return or exchange a product within 30 days which in my case have passed
 Even the Motorola dont have their exclusive service centers in Indian the service center they are having are on contract basis who are working for multiple companies simultaneously
 Thus having a very poor shopping experience

 The phone is very good in terms of speck and performance
 The build quality is really good
 But the battery is really disappointing
 In normal usage it lasts barely a day
 Once I was travelling and was using this phone for GPS navigation to my surprise battery was empty within few hours
 Of you usually use phone for navigation like me then make sure to carry a powerbank with you
 Another annoying thing I noticed about this phone is that I keep on getting a notice that says Restricted Access Changed Emergency service is blocked
 this happens every few minutes
 I found that many are having this problems
 I think this may be resolved in the next software updated

 The phone looks exceptionally good!!!!!!!!!!!! BUT.... Wont FALL for it His is a piece of cap being sold
 The Android Mitka 4.4.4 stock is not meant for this phone at ALLLL!!!
 The phone hangs a lot
 It is better kept empty as it proves to be a cap as it hangs a lot when it is filled with apply
 The andros 5.01 lollipop is just a tease which has not come to INDIA in months
 To please go select some other mobile as it is unworthy of the HYPE it is creating and created

 Hello readers Os here first time writing review of any products
 For moto g and i would definitely suggest to buy it
 Really it is product of value for money
 After using 20 days
 I am writing pro and sons of this products
 Rose os Great display you would love it at this prices
 os Multitasking much easier
 os picture quality of camera is good front(2mp) as well back(8mp).
 os sound quality of call is great
 os Built in quality and Hardware is great
 Sons os Battery back is real issue like any smart phone It can allow you to run 24 hours back for medium user for heavy user battery die in 12 hours max
 and in case of wife user it will give poor battery performance
 os some times difficult to judge which one is upside and downside as both side looks same
 os Hands free given with the phone is not up to the mark
 Os overall i rate this device definitely pick
 It this price range it is difficult to find such great device in market
 I hope you like my review
 Thank you

 I got Moto g and gen and got it replaced in a weeks
 Major issues in hearing as there is a lot of background disturbance
 Very annoying to have a conversation
 I have read about other people having the same problems
 Os moto not going to do anything about this
 Now many times do we get out product replaced and take back-ups and transfer our data
 Very very disappointed with the call quality
 The sound on apiece was buzzing/crackling, was really annoying because it happens in every call regardless the phone number
 Have tried changing my him to other honest
 There was no problem with those honest
 To issues with flipkart thought
 I would not recommend buying this handset.

 I have brought both Moto G 2 and Us Zenphone 5 from Flipkart.
 In almost all aspects Zenphone is better
 Also zenphone costs only 8999/-.

 His phone does not have the worlds best speck or the worlds best camera.But , for 13K it gives you more than enough
 Having quite decent speck and camera and of course the latest andros updates(Lollipop 5.0) its one of the best cell phone have used till date
 whereas no lag(even while loading heavy games like FIFA 15 or Ashphalt os and all my apes run smoothly
 The battery life is great and lasts unto a day on heavy usage
 Initially the battery will take unto 6 hours to charge but after a few days it wont take much time and PLEASE os NOT THE MOTOROLA CHARGER, use some other charger of samson or sonya because the phone will get charged quickly

 I just migrated to the Moto G from being with Foka for a long time
 I am yet to use all the features fully before I can qualify to comment whether good or bad
 But prima-facie, this mobile for the listed features is definitely a good value for Money
 I shall have to wait for few more weeks to check out all the features to come full circle before I pass my comments
 Package reached before time and was packed well
 The delivery person was courteous to quickly check the exchanging mobile and delivered this beauty

 I liked the Moto go camera
 I used Nexus 4 before but Moto go camera quality is very good
 Only issue I have seen is with my piece its not directing Memory cards which is very crucial

 I switched from windows phone lucia 820).
 Obviously there are many nice things to like here
 Android OS, customizability, ROMs and what not
 I heard good things about moto series and am not at all disappointed by the device
 The construction is of good quality not unlike the Foka honest
 Device is appropriately thin and light but its not setting records in either category
 It 13k, its probably not meant to
 Coming to the performance I am pleasantly surprised at how far andros has come since I left it (2.2 froyo) in search of smoother experience hence the WP).
 its not that the device doesn shutters
 It does
 But they are not in general animation and transitions
 Maybe if I am running too many apes and want to switch from goose play to camera
 its only 1GB after all
 Otherwise the feeling of stock andros is pretty great and if used well this phone keeps things smooth
 And this is someone coming from os which is a damn smooth system even on lowly 530.
 To I know what actually good performance feels like (820 is not the fattest phone out there but its no slough either
 Moreover the coming Lollipop update should help sweeter the deal even further
 I plan on unlocking the bootloader soon and getting into flashing rose
 Must waiting for at least one OTA to make its way onto a printing system
 I dont use the camera much
 I think still do well in good lighting conditions but I dont expect too many low light shots to shine through
 hats all from a couple of shots I did take just to check out the pp
 Overall I am very happy with my purchase and can easily recommend this phone

 Mobile is in not good not bad states Any things are appraisable, Camera processor External os card support
 Negative things are battery and DPI for screen
 but still good to go
 One thing that make you confused to buy is almost same kind of configuration you can get much cheaper with xiaomi red Os
 But G2's camera is far more better than its

 Writing this review after well using the product for 2 months
 Excellent products
 Value for Money
 West Budget Smart Shone PROS: VFM, Features Durability, Android Stock OS, Letter performance Less Heating Compatibility, Branding Naming
 Sons * Battery Lockup is not good(Requires 2 to 3 charges a day if connected to 3G/2G all day plus games for 1 he and browsing 30mins and location services for 1 hours and battery one percentage drops every 10 to 15 mind * Motorola should least give 3200mAh Battery for all the Moto E,G,X series
 * Front cam is not impressive if you take a lot of selfish
 And Camera pp is Buggy
 * Very low quality headsets(Worth just 50rs/- or maximum 100rs/-.
 Ought skullcandy and its great
 so another extra 500 bucks you may have to spend if you are a serious music julie like me
 * Charger is overhearing while charging but the phone stays cool(No probe for me
 * Price a little Higher(2000 may be considering the processor and graphics card and chisel same as MOTO Os * Almost doubled the price of MOTO E for just camera and bigger display
 That else is the change every other things are just the same
 Original Accessories are costly
 Delivery Happy with the delivery and the package

 Os like everyone I also impressed by the feature of the Moto G and genu
 I got it right on the st week of launch
 It was quite good until the day happens
 After the days of using the mobile I got an issue it happened suddenly it turned off automatically I charged it for an hour and tried to turn it on
 It just kept showing the moto log and no further response I did all the basic troubleshooting from my side
 I am even ready to do the factory rest
 To use it just kept displaying the look
 I reached out the service center on with Neck they are not ready to do the basic trouble shoot they just got the mobile and gave me some work out Sum and told the mobile will be ready in 7 days
 I called the service center again in 3 days to know the status
 They told like they are waiting for Parts to come from motor
 I gone weird on further questions they told like the Other Board gone dusted and they have requested for the replacement of mother board to motor and they are waiting for the parts to arrived 1 - Now come a days mobile get trouble with Other Board 2 - Now come the service persons request for replacement of mother board without my permission
 Customer Service the another Well which i entered into
 Worst ever Customer Are service
 - They told there is no replacement after 30 days even if the mother board is got dusted - One of the service person said his moto g also got dusted and questioning myself what can we do
 - They agree that Moto g and is facing the mother board issue for many customers
 - os ONE is ready to talk about the replacement
 In due after 7 days I called to check whether they at least replaced the parts Another shocking from the service center they told as it was moto and they may another 4 days to dispatch the parts from moto side
 Again I reached Moto Customer Service A lady picked and told that she has excavated the issue and will be getting call in 24 his
 - To response in 24 his when I reached the moto again they told there is no such a excavation at all - am being fooled by the service persons again and again
 - One guy said i must call at the where Service Enter is open and they will have the conference call to give the solution ( i dont why they can do in office without me Now they agreed to give me a solution in another 48 his that is too over i didn get back any calls yet The SLA of the issue is 7 days but even after 12 days they are not ready to give a compromising response - I will still going to reach out them - Other Board getting dusted in days is not at all a good mobile - Motorola is not ready to replace the device as it was more than 30 days another irritating service - To one ready to give you any proper response or ready to take responsible for our escalation.
 WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! NEVER os os MOTOROLA.

Chaitanya Avatapalli
 and purchased Moto G and genu from flipkart on rd October 2014.
 Fairly quick delivery
 Impressedwith the products
 But then on with december 2014 that is less the 3 months from date of purchase my device would just not turn on
 Online chat support was fairly impressive but not really helpful
 There are VERY FEW privately owned authorized service centres for motorola.
 teres my story When i finally reached the service centre in than Mumbai), I was informed that I had to wait for at least 90 minutes before my problem would be heard
 THE AUTHORISED SERVICE CENTRE ALSO ACCEPTS XAIOMI, BLACKBERRY, HTC and one more brand i cannot recollect
 And for all of these it has just 1 counter
 I came to know of a os customer who waited for over 3 hours for his turn
 Finally when it was my turn this was what was told to me ANY SOFTWARE PROBLEM WILL TAKE MINIMUM 3 DAYS, AND ANY HARDWARE PROBLEM WILL TAKE ATLEAST 10-15 DAYS.
 His was a standardized statement for all customers
 Bottom-line- You CANNOT expect quick easily or accessible after sales service
 Even though I have been a motorola fan him beginning to question its reliability after listening to so many experiences and experiencing trouble myself

 I already own a Moto G st edition and i decided to change the phone since i had to give that to my wife recently couldn decide on any phone other than Moto Os on this price range
 It has been just 2 days since the purchase
 I may give a detailed review later
 First Impressions 1. Feels premium 2. Bigger display looks better even with the relatively lower dip 3. Powerful dual speakers 4. Recent photos from the 8MP camera 5. Good battery life Overall I am not disappointed by this second purchase from Motorola.
 It is the most reliable phone comparing to the other phone you may be comparing right now likes of zen phone and Redmi.
 Finally Flipkart service was awesome as usual delivered the product well before the promised delivery date

 The phone was well packed and the delivery was very quick
 His is my review after working with phone for one weeks
 I os VERY DISAAPOINTED WITH THE HEADPHONES, VERY POOR QUALITY AND THE HEADPHONES I RECEIVED os SHACKING INSIDE THE MIC PART.
 BUT the Shone is working excellent and everything is sanctioning smoothly in phone
 i have been using SAMSUNG series phone for a long time
 The only difficulty i felt after working with SAMSUNG phone is 1.
 There can be an option for put the phone in silent vibration in ratification bar quickly as in samson honest 2. Turning on GPS and mobile data can be made available in the ratification bar easily as in samson with one click rather than again going to settings
 BUT overall the phone is the best budget phone

 Primary Camera Great quality
 Secondary Camera Below part
 Other Features STOCK ANDROID: Vice

 Camera quality and sound quality are also very good
 It has been more than a week I am using this phone and it has not hanged up even once
 I have been using Samsung Galaxy S-Advanced before this and was really tired of its hanging and battery problems

 When I call to service center they told me that you have to change PCB and it is not included in the warranty and it cost about half of the mobile phone

 Not this device the Next day itself - THANKS os FLIPKART FIRST SERVICE!
 The new Moto G isn just an amazing bargain
 its a phone that gives a surprising number of mid-range handiest a real run for their money and in most cases actually beats them hands down in terms of overall value
 I didn think it was possible to create a better phone than the original Moto Os but the latest version of Motorola's unstoppable hands rightly claims its crown as the new king of budget smartphones.

 I have been using this phone for past couple of months and am happy to have it
 FlipKart had a long delivery time probably due to Diwali rushed but I got it on the promised delivery date
 Its a good robust phone - unlike a samson or carbon which I owned earlier
 Bigger screen size compared to pre generation helps
 Battery is okay
 It doesn produce great photos - but they are good enough to share on whatsapp.
 I usually rely on my sonya camera for any serious photography
 In summary definitely recommend Moto G for anyone looking for sub 25K phone

 Ordered a Moto G and found out that call clarity was terrible
 The technical assistance tears suggestions did not work so I returned the handset.
 The second one I got had the same problems and also its battery was draining at a super fast speed
 Returned the second one as well and do not intend to buy motorola product again

 The new Moto G isn just an amazing bargain
 its a phone that gives a surprising number of mid-range handiest a real run for their money and in most cases actually beats them hands down in terms of overall value
 I didn think it was possible to create a better phone than the original Moto Os but the latest version of Motorola's unstoppable hands rightly claims its crown as the new king of budget smartphones.

 willn't talk about speck but below are some points to consider before u buy it 1 - good mobile if you are an office guy..good UI exit as stock andros is there
 2 - not worth for hardware games why.?? co high games like asphalt, have to be played at low cresol otherwise even with medium graphics it clashes out same with other games
 3 - battery is an issue if you play shalt contentiously it will last to 3-3.5 hrs..i have used other mobile at ask segments & they last for 5 his below is the battery life while using count having battery saving on & with battery doctor : high game like shalt - 3-3.5 he temple run os hrs,camera - 4 he music - around 4.5 he wife - 4-4.5 his currently i play temple run for 1 he in a day 1 he on call with g check whatsapp, email & ff check after half an hour each just for 5 min & having dual him inserted & i get battery back of around 5 - 5.5 he 4 - sound music is loud but not enough clear still acceptable 5 - good grip easy to use & good look 6 - some heating probe while using camera & gaming 7 - camera is 8 up but is awesome.
 it looks better than 13 up in its segment proper & clear image but only in day light
 at night it is like 5 up in its segment
 front camera is good 8 - take much time to get charged more than 3 he from 0 to 100% final words it is a better option if you are not an hard core game even after that you have to charge it twice a day.best for an office guy
 I say it 'gareebon ka iphone'.... os joking Hope it will help....

 To for this if you want a mobile with dual him
 Issues related to dual him compatibility.

KASHIF AHMAD
 The cell phone is great but they missed up with the Memory management of the android.
 Its throwing force close and clashes for games that i can easily play on a Moto E device
 I hope they'll fix it in the lollipop update
}
{
AKSHAY
 I will directly write the ports n sons of this device so that its easily helpful for all
 I am writing this review after using it for more than 2.5 months (83 days to be exactly
 Rose 1.Camera: affront Camera-This is the best thing about this phone.The 8 map camera works better than 12 map camera of other Indian bands like Micromax etc
 The HDR mode is best for snap
 Personal Suggestion Download and Use Google camera pp instead of built camera pp
 Os Google camera pp supports various modes for camera like Photo sphere Paranoma, Tens blur and better HDR mode
 Front camera 2 m.p.It is also good for taking selfish
 Believe me images come pretty good more than expected
 2.Display- A 5 inch display
 it depends on person to person .
 I like 5 inch display rather than 4.5 inch display on old Moto go
 The display is bright and good
 And come on friends who notices pp with naked eyes
 3. Dual Sterno Speakers Good for watching moves and playing games and are loud enough
 And as both speakers are on front side so u dont need to worry about placing phone upside down n all on table or bed so that speakers dont get blocked
 4. Software Sure Android experience and getting updated time to time #Lollipop coming soon
 After Nexus devices Motorola is the and company to get updated
 Note wont think that after Lenevo- Motorola Real there will be any effect on updated
 Google has sold only hardware unit and not all the patients n all
 And even Nexus 6 hardware is by Motorola.
 5. Prices It least if i compare it with bands like Samsung's, LG, Nokia,etc it is best value foe money phone
 Sons 1. Less Am 1 GB- Bags some time and apes crash sometime.(1.5 os or 2 os ram would be sufficient os 2. Design Must may enter through gap between the Dual Sterno Speakers and most people dont like than design and want their phone to be fully flat and covered on front
 3.Feels bulky and bigger in hands when compared to other slim 5 inch honest
 Now regarding Battery back I canst place it neither as a pro nor as a cone
 It is neither best nor bad
 It is better than other phone in range and average user may sometimes get more than a day
 Note Mile manager and audit recorder etc are not available
 But it is not an issue you can download from play store for free .
 Last But not least Flipkart Service at its best as always
 Thanks
 Merry Christmas

 Camera : 8 os main cam & 2 os front
 Very good snap so far both indoors and outdoor
 2MP - great selfie.Cam clarity is Excellent Round : The front dual speakers are awesome.
 Very nice sound.Sound experience is superb
 Shone gets headed.Heats very rarely in normal use Sure Android (4.4.4) (ALSO GUARANTEED UPGRADE os ANDROID LOLLIPOP 5.0) To Mile Manager installed You need to download os Mile Explorer from Lay Stores To to Settings>>About Shone and tap 5 times on Build number to enable developer mode
 os PROCESSOR: Moto G Guns on 1.2 GHZ SnapDragon ARM based Processor In the other hand ASUS runs on 1.6 GHZ Until x based processor
 The point here is most of the (99%)android apes are designed to run on an ARM based put
 Expandable memory - Additional advantage Moto G(1st genu with the screen size of 4.5 inch had 2070 may which was the one of the drawback of the phone
 Least now they should have used 2500 may battery for the inch new moto G(2nd genu , but they have used the same 2070 may battery
 Performance is also very good Well Design and accurate Delivery by lip part Headphone sound was average.HD Recording is good and camera is effective on dark room no light at 3.5 peter only and picture is good on Mobile flash light.Headphone wired is not too good.File Manager not found on 4.4.4
 mitka Battery(2070mh) performance is good if it is mixed use
 22hrs guaranty.brilliant
 5 inch IPS display which produce very high quality images and video with 720P.
 1.2 z Qualcomm Processor which allows you for multitasking.

 There are some stupid bags in the phone which is not expected of motorola.For ex while calling if u want to open keypad it doesn open in one go u have to press it thrice and then it appears
 Battery is another paint takes 4 his to get fully charged and drains in 12hrs of medium usage.Apart from the above negative everything is almost os but not great

Parvez Alam
 ny phone awesome features handy easy to use and its fun to play with
 The only problem is its battery takes almost 4 hours to get charged by its original charge on the other hand on using galaxy y charges it takes 2:30 to 3 hours to charge
 I think Motorola should work on there batteries or charges do the RCA) and fix it soon

 In I had purchased Moto Os and Men from Flipkart on with of September 2014.
 Flipkart was quick as usual in delivering the product at my door steps
 The device worked well for 3 months until 14.12 when it started refusing to boot-up.
 Took the phone to the Motorola authorized support expert where the device was detected with motherboard problems
 In 16.12,
 I had filed a formal complaint with Motorola via email for which I received an email back from Motorola saying Your question has been received
 You should expect a response from us within 24 hours.".
 Today it is 23.12.
 Haven't heard from them yet despite several reminders in between
 When I bought this phone a lot of my friends suggested not to go with Motorola.
 I am realizing that they were right
 To they have any service/support at-all?
 Or only sales
 To they realize that somebody is suffering because of their disgusting product and service
 It the moment it is not going anywhere
 Anybody faced similar problems
 Any way out

 I never used to buy a low range mobile phone until Motorola came into market with Moto Os
 I bought the st gen Moto G took
 And now buying this after one year is just amazing
 The speck increased are so much great
 The 8MP camera is lawless
 The 2 front speakers are amazing and very useful
 The inch screen is also really great
 With Lollipop coming to it
 It seems the best phone at this range

Slim Right weight Black color looks better than white 1 by considering all things at this price Performance wise and look wise overall quality of Moto g and gen is BEST.... buy bindasss...

 ply provide debit card payment offers through any other bank such-as (sbi) also
 because most of us does not have standard chartered bank account
 standard chartered bank have only very less branches through out the states
 particularly in TamilNadu there are only branches in Chennai and Coimbatore.
 so other district peoples are unable to avail this offer
 kindly accept this query and avail this offer to us through other banks

 I am writing this review after the use of Moto g for 2 weeks
 His is one of the best andros phone in this range
 The real andros experience is good and easy to use
 There is no lag of the applications and medial
 Of you are looking for a phone under the budget of 15 Os I would suggest to go for this
 New negative points i have noticed are - Charging speed is slow - Camera is average but again in this budget it is good

Tushar Gupta
 To not buy from this seller
 They have sold me the duplicate product which worked fine till one month and after that it is getting even switched on
 I have got it repaired from the service center twice but still problem has not been resolved
 I am sure they are selling duplicate products
 I will definitely take legal action against flipkart for the same and against this particular seller
}
{
Babu K B
 Rude many people complain about the battery life & software problems
 But for me have never faced any battery life & software problems
 His phone is much better then the mediate devices Therein with heavy use it dies within 1-2 hrs..
 His device lasts for 4-6 his of heavy usage Plus I hardly use it in weekdays so it lasts almost the full day With g on
 And charging is only once a day

Azaz Ahmed
 I was using a Bony Peri U running CM11 which fell and broken
 To after a lot of research I bought the Moto G and Men for 11.7k.
 Build Quality - 8/10 ( The volume and power buttons are flies ) Looks - 10/10 ( Surely the best looking phone at this price range ) Display - 7/10 Display is sharp and bright still canst match up to Sony's) Round - 10/10 Right sound funny but the speakers are loud enough to put my laptop's board speakers to shame All quality - 7/10 ( Maybe BSNL to blame but call quality is not up to my expectations UI - 9/10 Vanilla Android) Camera - 7/10 ( The default camera pp needs improvement
 Google camera gives superb results Battery - 6/10 Battery back up is good but and rather have a higher capacity battery I speed for this phone over Zenphone 5 because of stock android.
 Zenphone has a nice UI, but it becomes a burden after a few months
 With stock andros you have the option to customize it your own way
 PLEASE NOTE - The charger will charge your phone slowly so as to prevent the battery from over-heating.
 You may get a charger with higher may rating but it might spoil your battery within a years

 3.5 / 5 New problems
 Camera
 Its pathetic
 Enough said
 To much noise even when taken in broad daylight
 Only a fool would say that the camera quality is very good
 Its mediocre at best
 Memory
 The launched clashes quite often when you have lot of apes open / left open
 Especially when you open a relatively big pp and close you will see that launched clashes
 CPU speed
 Yes this is a budget phone but I found Semi Os is way faster than this phone
 The phone does last
 Wont believe anyone who says it doesn
 I have used a higher end phone also and this is slow and it shows
 But not very slow
 In a whole its a very decent phone
 But Semi Os is better and is only half the price of this one
 The only reason I bought this was hoping that AOSP would be very fast
 Unfortunately it want unto my expectations

 I got this phone 2 weeks ago and till now i have no complain..flipkarts service was great again delivering the item on time....at 13K we are getting a good smartphone with a promise of getting software updated in the long run...in short its a value for money thanks motorola for this awesome device

 I gifted this phone to one of my close friends
 I am writing this review after about two months of purchase
 The phone is good however there are two main things that I never expected from Moto atleast.
 1. Camera does not seem to be 8MP.
 Pictures are good for online sharing not great for printing
 2. Battery is average
 It barely touches 10 to 12 hours considering this is a multimedia enabled phone
 Battery could have been better
 Of you watch moves or listen to songs , the battery dies in less than 10 his
 Recommendation : Of you travel a lot better buy a battery bank or buy some other phone

 I bought this phone a while ago and everything worked well until one day when the phone completely drained of charge and when i tried to switch it on after charging it went on a Foot Loops
 I then handed over this phone to the Motorola Service Centre in Bhubaneswar that also happens to be the service centre of Karbonn, Micromax, Alcatel etc on with November,2014.
 They by the way are the most dumb people I have ever come across I find government officials to be more responsible then these serving people
 I am still waiting to get my phone repaired/replaced.
 I went to the customer service center at least 10 times without any success
 The worst part is that I called Motorola on their toll free not
 and explained the issue and they are saying the Parts for this phone are not available in Indian
 And they seem to have excavated the issue and told me I would get a call from the Actual Service Officials within the next 24 hours
 But they 24 hours wait has now turned into 240 Hours wait
 I would strongly suggest users not to buy this phone
 Only good specification doesn buy you a Customer Motorola, effective after sales service is also important

 I bought this phone when it launched and I am posting this review after using it extensively
 It is the best mid range phone having excellent features
 It has a 8MP primary camera and 2MP secondary camera which is far better when compared with its predecessor
 By views Pros:- The battery life which is the most important aspect is pretty good
 Letter gaming experiences than the old version due to larger display
 The phone does not hang at all as against the other Now Most phone which have flooded the market
 The photo quality is excellent
 The flash works amazingly during low light
 Os have seen people losing their cool as half of a mobile feature is nullified because of low internal memory
 His mobile obviously doesn give you a reason to crib on those grounds
 Cons;- The sound quality could have been better
 The phone could have been glimmer
 *SAR value seems to be a big deterrent.When compared with Samsung devices the figures seems to high
 Soto should work on reducing the SAR value when they plan the next version
 The phone is good and that is the reason everyone is talking about it

 moto go is a superb smartphone.
 Other mobile of the range canst touch the bottom line In Performance and in prices
 Camera is superb To hanging after inserting 32GB memory card and having data more than 10 os data Speed is much and much better than other smartphone like Samsung Grand series and low range Galaxy series
 Voice quality is superb It gives good Os speed in compare of other smartphones on the same network its os but not bulky due to its curved design Yes position of speaker for loud sound
 Clear conference voice and signal quality To call drop To hitting even hours and hours use I canst list out here all features here because I am collecting the features of MOto go by using it
 There are some lack also like Battery is not superb Earphone headset is not of best quality
 Not volume control in headset.
 To music change control in headset Headset speaker is not so fitted with ear initially
 You will have to be used to
 Round support sterno no money
 Power button is not like previous version Moto g Its accessory should come as freebies Not good for small hand
 To one hand use

 I ordered the product on launching day 6/9/14 but receive on 11/9/14.
 In first view it is the best phone budget but in reality the product is stuck.No matter it have 16 go in-build memory and allow to use around 12 by
 But when you fill its 6 go and more its performance take you to your worst nightmare.Its not actually Google product and more then 1 month since the lollipop update available it did not get any updated
 Also since last 2 days it become dead however no accident happened
 Service center promise me to return product at-least 5 working days or 15 if there is some problem in motherboard.

 Shone is very good at this prices West buy
 But never use the Hittel data offer with this phone
 Os usual Hittel having some hidden terms like you should use this offer for only to download apes and software ( this is the reason hittel customer care gave me
 Of you use it watch video or download music ( this is the , it will detect from your main balance and empty your balance
 Us who can take risk shall use the Hittel offer
 Hittel made flipkart as scapegoat to loot their customers

 Dear Team I bought this product from flipkart almost 3 months back and now suddenly my phone is not charging and its dead
 Now I am trying to turn it on but it is not turning on
 When I do the method of keeping the power button pressed for 120 seconds but the screen doesn turn on
 I have tried holding it for longer times too but the same thing happens yet it does not turn on watched you tube video for doing so
 I have read out this problem is still in MOTOROLA Men 2 honest
 I want a replacement of the phone as it under warranty or get it rectify at os or Indian
 Really its a big problem for me & Flipkart should resolve this issue as soon as possible
 Reply back for some positive solution

 Moto Os !
 A great piece at unfordable prices
 I got a faulty piece for first but was easily replaced by flipkart.
 Thank you for the service
 The camera quality is great front facing is also not bad works excellent in day light
 The ram should have been 1.5GB for more smooth multitasking,but looking at the price you can really complaint
 16GB memory brings everything in your hand and this one has a OTG(On The Os support took
 Os said by the moto they will be providing 5.0 update to this device as early as possible
 Interface is almost pure android.
 Though it has a gorilla glass 3 i have noticed some scratches on the screen so please ensure that you put on a screen guard as early as possible
 The sterno speakers are round but sound cracks sometimes mostly when you play a song with heavy bass
 The battery life is average about 7-8 hours of moderate usage and about 4-5 hours of heavy usage.(If
 the connection is 3G) Overall a very good phone by moto and in budget
 To for it

 Moto Os and Men is a good phone when it comes to the screen size looks clarity audit quality gazing Speed and so on
 But the main purpose of the phone gets defeated when there is no / poor signal
 Os is very weak
 Will get only Edge most of the time
 VERY VERY Door Reception
 Very good build quality with poor network reception
 Also the voice transmission is very very poor that the person on the other end would never hear anything when you sound soft
 Os a phone would rate 3/10 Os a gaming and video/audio device 8/10 Trust Broken..﻿

 Its a week now since I am using motor and Men and here is what i feel about this handset.
 Overall the touch is smooth and nice and so is the performance but what i feel is missing is 1.
 More Features like Battery % in Next 2. Launched and Lock Screen Customization 3.Pull down tabes like Wifi, Mobile Data should activate the functions rather than taking inside the settings
 4.Options to configure tabes in Status War pull down
 Battery Life is average and if taken care of can make this phone a great phone
 Will keep dating my review on more usage

 I bought this phone on the day it was released
 Round three months
 I have used this device to the core and tested it
 And this is what I felt after three months
 1.
 A good budget phone good for people who change their phone very often 2. Build Quality Not that great
 The phone kind feels cheap and when it falls down there are donna be debts
 To be careful
 Wont make it fall or something Os 3. Display Really good
 720p video look awesome.
 Screen brightness under the sun is less could have been a bit more bright
 4. Performance 1 go ram
 Initially was a bit doubtful about it but trust me its a beast
 I have nose real racing salt 8 and rarely last
 Very rare
 There is no doubt on performance for the prices
 I give it a 5 start 5. Camera Recent enough
 Clash is good HDR works well
 os Battery life Very bad
 Of you are a heavy user it wont even last for a day and for a moderate user it will last for day
 7. Gets heated up sometimes
 8. Round quality is oh not that great
 His phone is well suited for people who want good performance at an unfordable rate
 Of you are looking for good battery life not a good option but for the price its a beast
 I personally felt the build quality could have been better and battery also
 West everything is good

 I had bought this phone as a gift
 I had done plenty of research before buying this phone and everywhere this phone has got praises
 Except for very few low rate reviews on flipkart.
 Unfortunately I ignored these reviews thinking they were one-off cases and ordered the phone
 Now the st phone I got Os want working and there was a buzzing sound coming from the apiece during calls
 I got it replaced
 The and phone had the same buzzing sound problems but this time it was LOUD.
 To I got curious as how can 2 random phone could have the same defects
 To I checked my friends phone around 3-4 moto g os ALL HAD THE SAME PROBLEM!
 Must that the buzzing was very faint but when I pointed it out everyone could predominantly hear the buzzing sound
 I requested for a replacement
 The rd phone had the same problems however the buzzing was very faint
 Also now the main speakers sound warped when I play songs with a lot of treble
 I believe the people who complained about the speaker now
 It is present in all the honest
 I cannot believe that motorola is selling such cap now that they have established a decent enough market share in Indian
 N many thanks to flipkart for giving me 3 replacement just unfortunate that the product itself is a fail

Rakesh
 Google, through Motorola, got a decent upgrade through this and Generation Moto Os
 I also purchased MOTO G St Men for 13999 and I now feel really having been dumped into buying that st Men cap
 When devices like In got into our hands for same price as MOTO G st it was a huge letdown for those who purchased st Men MotoG.
 That said this is a decent device with middle banking specification and a camera that just ok for casual photography
 Nothing to boast about
 The screen size is a good advancement over the previous iteration.
 But even at 12999, this is in my opinion a had on the higher side of pricking
 Now that we have Redmi1s & In as price reference I believe that this a highly overpriced gadget.
 Presently we have many option in this price range where we can get better phone at lesser price points
 Of one can live with later updated Huawei Honor at 6999 is a better option

 Everything's good its fast allows multiple apes at a time no last
 West part of it it has a good camera with focus and burst imagine
 The sound of the speakers are crisp and loud
 Only regret that the battery could have been better
 Normally the phone perishes after 3 - 4 hours of GPS use or Os browsing

 His phone is just brilliant.As we already know that its a budget phone with some nice speck but my phone is having one severe problem for which i am suffering till date that sometime my phone touch goes responsive and after a report it starts operating normally

 i am the only person who is having this kind of problem wid my phone.otherwise
 this phone is awesome go for it

 The phone is looking superb,light weight tested this product by surging the internet continually for 9 hours till charge remains 7%,I played games for 2 hours continuously I heat only very little its negligible even u can avoid that by cooling by means of os security the phone is superb speed but dont install high end games

 I have been using the phone for 2 weeks now
 The phone is excellent in every aspect and a value for money
 All quality is very good and loud which is a missing feature on most of the smartphones today
 Camera on both sides are decent enough resolving enough details.Although, in some other phone , the front camera is more focused on selfish but the one in Moto Os is decent enough for video chats and casual selfies.And yeah I feel that the battery could have been a bit better

 Now its almost 3 months with the phone
 Overall I am good with the Moto Os Display sound and software is great as expected
 However I found moto G and generation slower then the first generation
 The phone hang when you download a few apes from the stores
 all display icons become invisible and its become dead for a few seconds
 apart from this single complaint I am happy with the device
 Moto needs to work on the problems probably a processor update or software improvisations can solve this problems
 at last great phone at this prices

{
Shridhar Toshn...
 Have been using this phone since last 2 weeks
 Overall a good phone
 But some cost os Takes 3 hours to charge full battery
 It last for 30-36 hours depending on usage
 os Ratification tones and ringtone level remains same
 There is no separate settings for setting ratification tone low
 os Personal mail singing sometimes does not work and has to be done manually.
 May be one time issue
 os Does not come with a USB cable
 Flipkart delivered the product before the schedule delivery date

 Requested to replace it BUT REQUEST AGAIN TURNED DOWN.
 Of flipkart has to turned down every request then Y showing the status at home page "30 days replacement guarantee
 I wanted to buy goose phone that the only reason I came to FLIPKART but I think I made a mistake which I have to pay now

 I ordered Moto Os in flipkart on with Dec'14 and the delivery was schedule on with Dec'14.
 But yesterday (17-12-14) in Cracking Order there was a message that Your order is out for delivery
 But today 18-12-14 the order was canceled and the following message received to my mail The regret to inform you that our courier partner was unable to deliver following items in the Order OD201524143487280300." It is very worst experience in Flipkart I had

 Since speck are available on the net just a quick noting of experiences cross - Good solid build and feel - Lip cover also available on flipkart strongly recommended - Good Camera both in still and video - Average battery life - Gorilla glass screen - no screen guard required bones - A little under lowered - lag while twitching apes / sluggish response - In SIM so get yours cut / changed in advance os - Camera could have been better For the price point and reliable performance - recommend it !

 New weeks back our new moto Os got superheated while charging and its switched off permanently......
 But the service center quickly responded for our request & replaced our fault piece with a new box piece.... Oats off for service... Overall performance is good....

 BEST os THE REST os THIS PRICE TAG USING PHONE SINCE LAST 4 DAYS ITS NOT JUST PROS AND CONS , ITS PRO'S, OK'S AND CON'S PROS: 1. GOOD AND FAST PROCESSOR - os LAG 2. CALL QUALITY TOP NOTCH WITH NOISE CANCELLING 3. PURE KITKAT WITH GUARANTEED " L " UPGRADE.
 4. LOW LIGHT PICTURES os CAMERA EXTEREMLY GOOD. 5. LAST BUT NOT LEAST - SOLID BUILD QUALITY.
 6. EXPANDABLE MEMORY.
 OK'S 1.SCREEN PPI AND COLOR VIVIDNESS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
 2. CAMERA NOT THAT TOP NOTCH BUT NOT COMPLAINABLE.-GOOD
 FOR THIS PRICE RANGE 3. FRONT SPEAKERS- MANY PEOPLE PRAISE ABOUT THE FRONT SPEAKERS , BUT os REALLY os NOT THAT LOUD, THIS os os 5 os PHONE os 3 YEARS AND os I CAN EASILY FIND THE DIFFERENCE. 4. MUSIC AND SOUND OUTPUT QUALITY NOT GREAT BUT OK, EVEN WITH HEADPHONES. 5. FINGER PRINT MAGNET BACK COVER.
 6. BACK PANEL LITTLE SLIPPERY.
 7. FOR SOME HIGH END GAMES PROCESSOR HAS SOME LAG. 8. COULD HAVE DONE WITH A BETTER CUSTOMIZED UI , STOCK ANDROID (EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST KITKAT) FEELS VERY CHEAP AND NOTHING SPECIAL.
 BUT THIS CAN os OVERCOME os PURCHASING EVERYTHING os LAUNCHER os THEMER APP WHICH os THE GREATEST os UI CUSTOMIZATION HOME REPLACEMENT AVAILABLE TODAY os ANDROID STORE.
 CON'S 1. THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS os os DEFAULT WITHOUT BRIGHTENING os TOO TOO LOW , EVEN FOR INDOORS os A HALF LIT ROOM.
 JUST INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS os ONE POINT AND EVERY THING os FINE. 2. os DLNA AND NFC. 3. NOT A VERY GOOD AUDIO CODEC.
 4. LAST BUT NOT LEAST , BULL SHIT EAR PHONES, COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITH JBL os EARS.
 SUGGESTIONS: 1. COULD HAVE DONE WITH os MORE GRIPPIER BACK PANEL.
 2. A BETTER HEADPHONES. 3. COMPLETELY CLOSED FRONT DUAL SPEAKER VALLEYS.
 os YOU KEEP THE PHONE DIRECTLY UNDER A LIGHT AND LOOK os THE EDGE os THE SPEAKERS YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND THE BOTTOM FROM WHERE THE SPEAKER EMERGES, NOW THIS SMALL GAP CAN os PRONE os DUST AND SWEAT WHICH CAN os INSIDE.
 4. USB PLUG-GABLE CHARGING PLUG.
 5.3000 MAH BATTERY.
 THATS IT, FINALLY os os A GOOD PHONE, EVERY THING HAS ITS PROS AND CONS, WELL YOU CANT EXPECT GALAXY Os ALPHA FEATURES AND SELL FOR 13 Os BUT WORLDS FIRST MOBILE PHONE MANUFACTURER AND POWERFULL ANDROID MAKES DEADLY COMBINATION, THERE ARE PHONES LIKE KARBONN, ALCATEL, XIAOMI Os WHICH MAY HAVE DOUBLE SPECS AND SELL os THE SAME RATE os SLIGHTLY HIGHER.
 BUT CANNOT os COUNTED FOR ENDURANCE.
 BECAUSE os 4 YEAR OLD MOTOROLA ATRIX Os STILL SMOKES SOME os TODAY'S NEW AND GOOD PHONES FROM TOP MAJOR INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURERS os ALMOST EVERY RESPECT.
 HENCE os OPINION """"" GOOD DEAL """ And 3 May Super Last Delivery By Flipkart

 Shopping Experience I tried placing the order least 7 times before finally placing it
 2 times it went out of stock and even after placing my email for a ratification of availability i didn get any email
 While placing the order the offers kept changing every second and finally the product went out of stock !
 Finally I had to place my order like i was catching a Shatabdi Delivery of Product : I ordered the product and was given an estimate of Dec 16 for delivery
 I received it on Dec 12. 5 stars for delivery and package quality
 The Product itself I had checked the technical configuration and found it to be pretty good at this price range
 saw useful comparisons with os 90, but looking at the number of pieces sold i went for Moto Os
 The appearance of the phone is very class the white color gleam out
 Battery back is pretty good with average calls gaming and net surging
 I believe it could last more than 2 days if not fiddle much
 I did experience some heating while playing Kinship battle around the camera lens
 The Andriod version takes some time to get used to after you have used a Samsung.
 Camera quality is quite good I did see some concerns for the Moto E camera but now in fine
 The size is as large as Nexus and takes a day to get acquainted to after you've used a 4 inch screen
 Of you have the above 10 budget you can go for it
 Thanks

 Of u r stock andros lovers go for this
 His is the best mobile
 It meet all the basic requirement a mobile should have and a person should hold in their hands
 Design is os things not great processing is good
 Its perfectly in the hands bc of curved back
 Good to have removable back shell atleast, so that we can use different coloured back shells Only dropout I felt badly with this mobile is battery backup.
 It is drawing too fast
 I hope lollipop update will helpful in this matter
 Definetly if u r is travelling out of station one should carry back battery for sure
 I want to add one more thing is flipkart gave awesome delivery they delivered this in just 30hrs after I placed the order

 I ordered the phone on its launch day....Flipkart was giving so much offers on launch day...but almost all were useless....Delivery is on time...The phone is a good one with very good performance...Initially Battery performance was very bad....but after a few days battery performance improved....The rear camera is very bad with respect to a Foka with Karl Less lens....low light performance is below the line
 Otherwise its a good buy...Slim nd Very phone... Very good display....The price should be within 10k.

 I purchased this product one month back and the phone was working alright for few days
 After few days the phone experienced some problem with not getting switched so i took to their authorized service dealers in pure
 The experience has been horrendous since then their service centers are shared by many multi bands and they have highly non-professionals at their service center
 They committed that they will give an estimate and solution to the problem within 2 days but there hasn been any communication after 2 days so i spoke to their service center and they claimed they will take another 7 days to give me an estimate and when i insisted that i need it urgently they replied in an irritating manner to contact motorola.
 The customer care of mototrola also is not equipped enough with into and they hung me up for around 30 mind to finally escapade the matter further
 The matter will take another 2 days and till then i am careless what this company is doing for its customers
 The service level is below pathetic than any brand in today market and i fail to understand how can a mobile take 7 days to identify the problems
 Motorola is not recommended for its after service after the experience that i have went through and i was planning to buy for my mon but now i wont even recommend at all for their service standard
 I request flipkart and its users to discontinue using moto phone till they resolve their service standards
 Pathetic
 Disgusting Non-professional

 I Everyone I have bought a Moto G-2nd Men (DEC-14 edition from Flipkart.
 Flipkart packing and delivery process canst be questioned
 Were holding it in hand gives you a feeling that it is superb
 Though I haven started using it in full swing on start up I found some unerasable/unscrachable/unremovable log marks specifically battery & back cover logos).
 I erased some of the logs by rubbing them with cotton after applying nail polish removed onto them
 But this is not working for the battery & the back cover look

 I was spell bounded and completely overwhelmed by the prepossessing sight of my new phone
 The breath taking features and the mellifluous sound of its speakers are impeccable.
 The camera and video quality are verisimilitude to the real world

 The a la mode looks of this phone is something which can only be compared to itself co i dont feel any other phone can stand in competition against it

 His is not regarding the product but the cheating and fraud done by Hittel for offering 1 os of data on 2G/3G connection on this MOTO G(2nd Men products
 I purchased this product and followed the steps mentioned view T&C apply for getting this offer activate on my mobile phone
 I visited www.airtellive.com/offers
 using on mobile phone after enabling data network and I got the following message To offer exists for this device
 I immediately called up FlipKart customer care and they told me that this is not their responsibility and I have to contact hittel for the resolution
 I contracted hittel but there has been no response from them
 I have wasted so much time and money while moving here and there from flipkart and hittel and so on
 It least flipkart can ensure if the offer by Hittel in genuine or not
 Either this is mis-selling attempt by Flipkart for selling their phone or they have send me the second hand phone where the hittel might have disconnected the offer after giving one
 There is definitely something wrong
 I am user of Flipkart since last 5 years and never face such fraud in these years

 we 3 friends purchased this phone at same time
 one device started showing issues in about a months
 Contracted FlipKart support
 After initial diagnosis there was no response from FlipKart and now they are saying your 30 days is past and we can replace your device
 The support only cares for his rating and not on the resolution
 I will never recommend anybody to buy on Flipkart from the experiences I had with FlipKart.
 I have decided to take this legally and will be initiating the process soon

 I received a defective piece on delivery
 The ringtones and sums tones were not ringing when modifications were received
 In exchange I got a working model the and time only when I realized that the first one delivered by flipkart was probably a used one because it had a clear screen guard already on it which I thought was the usual protective one received from the manufacturers
 But the new ones screen protector had speck printed all over it
 I am pretty sure the first one delivered was a returned item probably from someone who had found the same ringtone issues and returned which gives me a bad feeling about Flipkart that they are trying to shove the defective pieces again onto other buyers thinking that someone would at least quietly keep them !
 Pathetic !

 Must got the phone 4 days back
 Although the phone is quite good and all but the Him 1 slot gives a lot of trouble
 It does not catch network most of the time
 While there is no problem with the other slot at the same time

 I liked the phone by reading reviews and specification
 But after started using it feel dissatisfied at many fronts
 Battery drops quickly have to use many battery save apes to use it throughout the day
 Display is one factor that attracts but fails at other ends in terms games and hardware rendering apply
 AnTuTu Benchmark score is approve
 ask even while testing it was crashing like anything
 Any apes just crash in between a using it and make device unstable
 Its just value for money phone just use it as a normal smartphone with limited use of apply
 Wont expect much
 It is good to view video
 Overall it is 6.5/10 based on my experience

 Considering the speck and comparing the performance the phone outran many of its competitors in the price segment
 Overall a satisfactory device for regular use though high end games is often a bit lagged
 For example Shalt 8 and The dark knight the older paid one
 Gros include latest OS which WILL be updated to Android L or Lollipop, and the almost stock andros experience is really nice
 16gb internal and the sd card slot makes the phone a really good option for people who carry heavy amount of music video and moves
 Lastly had the ram been 1.5 by it would have added a couple of more thousands but the phone would have been legendary.

 I am a shone user and have purchased this phone for a change but was bit disappointed with respect to the expectation that I was having
 user experience when compared to shone was not so good
 Battery power management in the OS is also not good
 I saw many times message that application stooped working and later they start
 It looks like they are crashing
 There are lot of scope to improve the user experience and the Operating system

 I bought this phone every thing is good but battery drains fast
 That is the use of smartphone if there is no smart battery life
