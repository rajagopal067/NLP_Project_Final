 While charging MotoG2 with my car charger it has caused problems twice as follows 1.
 Once the phone did not report when the car charger was connected
 It was just white screen
 To fix this I long-pressed the phone power button for a minute it came up
 (scary! - i decided of returning it 2. Second time when I plugged out car charger it was in a loop rebooting.
 I just put the car charger back it came up
 (scary! - fixed by itself within a mind To avoid above issues always use Moto recommended charges :-)

 Flipkart delivery service is fantastic
 Its been 3 weeks since him using this

 I got most of the features from this phone which I could get only in the coster honest
 I had to however sacrifice the language omission - I could not read Gujarati with this phone
 Language support only for Devanagari script (Hindi/Marathi).
 The phone is quite fast and after using Samsungs it was a pleasant changes
 Highly recommended
 Had it enabled me to read Gujarati I would have given it 5 stars

 I am using this device since from last 15 days
 Sons I am quite upset with the battery performance
 once i was locked when the battery drained out from 62% to 20% within 3 min of using os Browser.
 i have tried all the weak but it doesn respond much Arterio sound is good but doesn seems clear if played in high volume
 Not able to play ppsspp games
 RAM shows only 851 MB.
 Rose Touch is very smooth
 never realized lag between twitching apes and in multi tasking.. Supports OTG.
 Anyway i dont feel any major issue except battery performance
 if this can be resolved then I would never mind to give 5 star to this phone

 I got this Shone on An and on the same of delivery i faced some touch not performing properly..but i just waited for few days to do double check..now its one week still the phone touch function not working properly and also it getting hanged sometimes..i made a request for return..am very much unsatisfied in this purchase..To note i got this phone on exchange offer for 11k, i doubt whether i got some defective item since i got for less price not sure
 Now today An with i got my replacement mobile
 But this phone once i opened and started using am getting wire burnt smell in us port and in headphone ports
 While charging the smell is too much
 Also once i opened back cover there are some stick marks inside the phone which doesn look like a new products
 And browed in net about this issue came to know many moto go has these issues
 Hence many people requesting for return the replacement product given to customer is not a genuine new products its another defective product returned by another customers
 Flipkart & WS-Retail & Motorola is cheating people around here
 Wont buy this phone
 I lost hope on flipkart bad service
 To proper quality check
 Now i requested flipkart for good replacement or better return my money P.S : I am a regular flipkart buyers got many mobile through flipkart recently i got two moto products from flipkart which works fine till now..but this moto g purchase made me unsatisfied

Shubham Rawat
 have used both Moto G and Men and Us zenfone 5.
 The performance of zenfone os i can doubtless say is much much better than Moto G IInd.
 The main drawback is its low RAM.
 Any tasks get stopped while in the background
 It normal use the free RAM is about 180MB which is very very low as compared to zenfone 5 which has about 1.2GB free RAM at normal use
 Also in price factor Zenfone 5 is much better
 Camera is also better in zenfone 5.
 The benchmark scores of denmark os quarante standard and others are a way much better for zenfone 5.
 Even zenfone 4 beats moto g and in benchmarks.
 Only in looks is moto g and better than zenfone 5. Zenfone 5 looks a bit large in size

 as I hoped , camera quality is very good still secondary camera is little slow about capturing movements of object,still quality is better both for images and videos......as ram is 1 os and processor is 1.2 GHZ , I didn find my phone working so smoothly , looking wise good touch is not working too well as I supposed but still this mobile is much better than its equivalent mobile of range 10-15 000.........

 I am using this phone since 4 months till today fully satisfied with the products
 Never hanged or stopped unexpectedly
 Display is fine with 720p but rich colors appears slightly dull
 sound is oka needs to improved
 head phone supplied along with the equipment is very low in quality
 Os speed is good.battery
 back up is same like all andros honest nothing special.No file explorer you need to download it from play store.take
 lot of time to charge the battery may be because of charger issues
 Overall very good product at this price

 Never buy moto products just scrap they are selling
 Still if you buy and if you are not getting any problems with in three months I can challenge on this
 Horse service and june products
 Please friends dont buy Motorola products just june they are selling
 That is the reason they are not selling directly through retail endorse
 Of they are selling online nobody can do anything
 Must because of Flipkart reputation and Android OS they are able to sustain Indian market
 not because of MOTO brandy
 Must Sunk
 People dont waste your hard earned money....I am serious please dont buy MOTO MOTO MOTO.

 I buy this phone actually I ordered this phone for my father but I must say those who are reviewing this in camera quality and saying having average camera or below average , I will say the camera is not average its above average provide u a clear picture I scanned 160 pages of book through this phone and convert in of through camscanner the camera is best u cannot say the ebook i made through this is not clear image and that with same sonya peri or it worst .
 rest about the RAM idea 1 os is i thought it should be 2 os at this price point i didn had any issue regarding RAM but as compare to other phone below this price having same 1 os RAM but dont face any problem regarding graphics gaming crash or apes or picture quality sound call quality all are good as I give anyone to suggest to buy but more disappointment is battery back my father didn play games or dont have any free time to use this phone but in morning he go to office to fully charge the phone 100% and in night when he come still plug in to charges as the battery remains 50-60% or less then 30%

 I have buy this cell from flipkart and they deliver within two days good job flipkart keep it up
 Coming to the phone...Its the best smartphone you get for ask except xiaomi mid but that has been discontinued from from flipkart,so moto g is the best option left if you want to experience andros 5.0 Rose the display is awesome colors are vivid look natural not saturated like Samsung shit phone all he games can be played lawless except modern combat 5 which laws sometimes and shalt 8 on high graphics setting
 3.stereo speaker are the best but dont expect anything like etc boom sound speaker
 battery back up can say average had to charge every night
 rear camera produces great images in outdoor condition and average on indoor,better than my previous ll optimism g which has 13mp.
 best low light images can be capture in dark areas
 Sons there are some vertical lining on my display when screen is off only visible in sunlight but does not affect while using the device
 flags sometimes when multiple pp open in background
 and i would suggest that do not put matter screen guard on this device screen start to look like pixelated

 His is my second Motorola Shone
 Ought this after my MOTO G was stolen
 Decided to stick to the MOTO phone due to its snatched performance and premium feel and i am really happy with the New Moto G ( and Gen).
 Everyone has written about the phone so i dont think i need to mention all the pro and sons all over again
 For those guns who are confused between this and Us Zenfone os * To for Moto G Men os though the camera is not as great as asks but the lifetime battery of the phone is great and this can save your life in difficult situations Experience with Flipkart Return / Service * Badly the phone i received was faulty ( The second him card slot was not sanctioning properly and The Power button was faulty ) * I Called up on the flipkart Toll Free number and spoke to the CSR, she was really helpful and placed a Replacement request
 * Within a day i got my faulty phone replaced by a New Handset.

 1. Happy New Dear Everyone I have been using this product for a month i ordered it on 1 december 2014 and received it on 6 december 2014 thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone on time so first thing about the phone when you look at it is that its build quality build quality is really good it does not look cheap phone motorola has down a great job with that if you are using the first gen of this phone then processing wise both are same had same chisel of 1.2Ghz qualcomm quand core processor 1 B ram so if you have the first gen motorola moto g dont buy and gen 2.The phone has upgrade like the inch os screen but it is not full os it is 720p os resolution another thing it has a memory card slot which we dont have in first gen moto g and expandable up to 32GB 3.Camera perform it has imp rear camera and imp front camera rear camera is good in day light and also low light imagine is very well motorola has upgrade this camera and it is good but it takes some time to focus in artificial light front camera is good but when you take selfie's with it it produces shake images both the camera can take video in 720p os and it also has a slow motion with 720p os resolution 4.Gaming the device can handle high graphics game like shalt 8 etc.But the phone gets heat up while playing games the sterno speakers perform very well and produce good sound 5.Display is 5 inch os display which has 720 X 1280 pipes resolution it is an IPS LCD screen with 5 inches in size 6.Battery is of 2070 may same as the first generation but is ok for this phone works all working day 7.It also supports OTG USB device very smoothly 8.Graphics are really good aren 305, 450MHz single core 9.Os is mitka 4.4.4 with upgrade of 5.0 Sons of this device are 1.First it should have least 1.5 os ram 2.It should have more battery it is 15% less than the first gen moto g because of 5 inch screen 3.Front camera could have been improved 4.It some times needs more time to shift apes while multitasking 5.It's arousing speed decreases with 5-4 tabes running at a time causing camera for about 10 to 15 min decreases the battery percentage 7.As above mention the device heat up while gaming

 His phone simply works for everything
 its fast responsive and does everything I need
 have owned several other Android phone in the past but this beats everything else hands down at this price point
 By only complaint is that the phone got wet but the repairs were not covered under the warranty
 have seen notes that other Boots (X, X2?) have better warranty coverage
 Still the repairs weren too expensive and the phone is as great as every
 Highly recommended

 I bought this damn thing on the Fig Million May sale
 Listed below are a few of the issues have faced till date 1. Battery - There is no idle battery time on this device
 The battery drains really quickly
 When I got sleep at 12:30AM with the moto battery showing 33%, with all services like GPS, wife and mobile data turned off the battery goes down to os when I wake up at 6:30AM.
 his of idle time drained 32% of the battery
 His battery issue is there in all moto go mobile across the globe
 wont be fooled by its 2070 may battery it is worthless
 2. User Experience - It hangs most of the time and suddenly you see a pop-up of an pp which was never opened to have stopped working
 Pp like whatsapp and facebook take a long time to load and when it does these apes hang up during the middle

 Since I am a big fan of expensive phone like xperia, note apple and its my first moto device experience thought but lets be honest The os greatest asset is its small price tags
 For 13000 INR, it became awfully easy to forgive the thing for not being the quickest the prettiest or the smartest
 Still it is one that wound up being more than just good enough Flipkart is just 10/10 with its delivery states
 Awesome !

 if u want a branded mobile which u can rely on for its lifetime then go for it
 u may get a solo or micromax for this price with amazing features but the thing is it might get spoiled fast and it wont be worth the money u bought it for due to the cheap quality of components that they use
 i give a star less due to the fact that its ear phone is of sub-par quality and it takes about 4 hours to charge

 West part is you can use about 12GB of your internal memory for applications as well as data storage
 Not like Micromax phone who write 16GB internal memory on the box and hardly 1.5GB is available for applications

 Moto G and gen is a good budget phone
 However it made me a bit sad with its speed as it is lowered with 1GB RAM.
 Of you play high end games it would make your phone a bit slow and shaggy

 I have been using Moto g earlier version which has better battery performance other than that all are good except u r mobile signal will go down once in some days and u have to report the mobile to fix it ..(very less occurrence ) touch is good as it used to be....better check for battery power bank before getting it

 I bought the phone because my galaxy s screen cracked
 I got so sick and tired of manufacturers loading their bloatware and theme skins on top of the beautiful andros interface
 I also absolutely love on-screen navigation buttons
 I would never go back to capacities buttons or hard buttons again
 His phone is guaranteed to get the Android Lollipop update in the coming weeks
 That I love about the phone is its fluidity and battery life
 However since it is running stock android, I was disappointed because a lot of convenient CM11 features were missing
 Things like not being able to customize the ratification pull down menu torch quick tongue etc However these issues will be corrected once Lollipop is out as it sorrows and improves upon a lot of features in CM11.
 Also it would have been nice if it came with a multicolored ratification LED os The os screen is sharp at normal viewing distance
 I was honestly worried about whether I wouldn like the downgrade from a 440ppi screen to a 300ppi screen
 him happy to say that anything more than 300ppi is unnecessary as you wont be able to tell the difference 99% of the time and unless you hold a 440ppi screen right next to it
 The only problem with the screen is that its not as nice as an AMOLED display
 Although I appreciate the brightness of the LCD panel i hate using it in bed due to the poor viewing angles
 Gilt the phone too much and you start seeing the glow from the backlight emanating from the screen
 It absolutely annoy me and it sometimes induces motion sickness
 I hate how stupid the dual speakers look like
 They could have been smaller... it makes the phone look like a plastic toy
 The phone would have looked better if they just designed the speakers to look like trills instead of a bare
 Anyway all in all its a fantastic phone
 I dont have too many regrets except for the points stated above
 But then again I am paying only ask for it and it is a bargain
}

 I have used this product for 2 weeks and am sharing my experience
 I have chose this over others as it is an all-rounder.
 Build and looks-The economics are good and does not feel very thick due to its curved design
 It looks more like a ask phone than a ask phone Display-The display is crisp and has natural colours
 Next is clearly visible in bright sunlight
 It does not need a scratch guard as it is protected y gorilla glass Cameras-Both the front and back camera are amazing in outdoor as well as indoors Storage-We have 16gb internal storage out of which about 12gb is available
 In the generation of 128gb expandable storage motorola is only providing 32gb expandable storage which is a minor con Battery life-It is good enough to last you a whole day of normal usage RAM-It is very less and can be clearly noticed while doing multitasking.
 I wouldn mind paying k more for 1.5gb ram Sound-The front facing speakers provide a good audit effect but it is not very loud
 Even call quality is very good UI and updates-It runs on the goose now launched which is very smooth
 Even software updated are guaranteed for about 18 months
 Still waiting for andros L though Ignoring its sons considering the price of the phone it is awesome for the prices
 Even grand prime having que screen is prices higher

 The specification truly define the phone 2. Though not slim but it appears to be stylish and slim

Glenn Mascarenhas
 I had to apply for a replacement as in the phone I received the ratification panel would not slide down at times
 You had to lock and clock the phone for the problem to be solved but it would reoccur.
 To if that the case in your phone took apply for a replacement as the problem has been listed in the Motorola forms and everyone facing it has got a replacement
 Were him listing only some of the sons of the device that I received after replacement ->The lock key and volume button of the phone are not sturdy
 They are loose and move sideways
 ->The senior of the phone I received seems to be defective
 When during a call I need to switch on a feature like speaker or open the dealing pad the phone screen goes off as soon as I try to touch it and comes on again when I move my finger away which is very annoying
 I just hope that the problem doesn become worse os MOST IMPORTANT NOTE: I really doubt that Flipkart gives you a brand new product when you go for replacement
 The phone I received after replacement showed signs of being used earlier although it was a completely packed piece
 It must have been returned earlier by someone
 To I would say that as far as possible try not to go for replacement as it is more probable that you may get an even worse products
 Therefore I would say that getting a perfectly working product without any defect in the first go is pure luck

 His is the best option I found in this price range
 All features are as described
 Picture quality is good
 Voice etc thing are good
 I am giving it 4 star after comparing it with other phone especially Os Mini) in this price range
 Not giving 5 star because the only thing bad about going with Moto G is the Motorola customer care & service center
 Of by any chance you face any issue definitely it is not going to be resolved or have to heavily pay for it
 Otherwise phone is good just pray you never need to contact the Motorola customer care & service center

 i purchased this phone after using nikita lucia 720, I found that overall performance of mobile are good but its battery back performance are below average .
 I charged this phone twice in day even for a normal usage on internet also find that phone take around 3 hours for 100% battery charge from low battery condition
 mobile also lost network for SIM slot 1 some time
 i m not sure that the problem related to drop network are due to hardware problem of phone are due to improper cutting of SIM card otherwise display are good processor are good no delay even gaming.... voice quality are good battery performance are below average

 Ought this phone 3 days ago
 The Flipkart delivery time was really good
 Have been testing the phone since then
 Were are some points about the phone 1.
 The primary camera is pretty good in day but at night there are some grains in image
 2. The screen is awesome with Gorrila glass 3. 3. The grip look and overall dimension is really better than other phone in this price range
 4. The battery back is average with dual him but the word in the air is about a great improvement in battery performance after the Lollipop upgrade 5.
 The speaker sound is unique better among all the phone in this price range
 6.
 The battery back during gaming is pretty good
 7. THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE: STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE LOLLIPOP UPGRADE!!!!!!!!! :'(

 Everything is oka
 But if you need to charge your phone after every 8-10 his it makes no sense
 1 con hides all pro for products
 It least it should give 15 his backup.
 In 21 st century phone are not for only making calls such a good specification andros phone I guess is for at least person can use internet and listen music
 ignore playing games working professional dont even have time for that
 Of you are travelling forget your phone can be helpful
 You start goose map for the destination you want to go obviously GPS will be on and battery drains like anything
 or you want to update apes via wife yes it will updated no comments on processor but now you need to charge your phone as wife have suck or battery

 I am using this phone about 2-3 months.It is really amazing and battery performance is also good and picture and video clarity is superb.specially
 front camera is good for selfish
 Os it is a 5 inch phone so it portable and fits anywhere in the pocket
 And we can play games like temple run,subway surface etc without any lag.and
 I also watch os high definition video on it and the video clarity is also good
 I found only one problem with this phone is that the front camera is good but it sometimes it laws but it is good for video call and normal photo it very high clarity photo
 To I give it a rating of 4 star .
 And flipkart os packing is also good and delivery is also very fast
 I recommend you all to buy this phone from Flipkart.com
 thank you !

 Gros Superb body & design ; dont need a cover to protect it unless you want to be too protective Speaker volume : Its more than expected Exchange : His is biggest advantage
 By earlier solo mobile battery was swollen 1 and half year hence in exchange I got good branded phone
 Next andros version I dont know how would next version be but least i can upgrade by phone Sons Battery life : Its less but least you can use battery save mode
 You need to find ways to save battery
 Full day use will drain out battery in 8-10 hours War phone ; Quality is average
 Would have been better
 Connector : The charger does not include the connector.
 I was fortunate enough to have a connection of old phone I am giving 4 star just because it is Motorola.....else this is 3 star quality phone

 Very good thing comes at a big prices
 Certainly false .
 just take a look at this phone
 I mean just look at it
 its the best phone under 20000.
 And the thing to be notes it is one of the lowest in the section took
 Really a beauty to use
 Sure andros with good performance and is real fast
 Working on this phone is lawless
 The feature of expandable memory has made it almost perfect
 But it too has some issues
 The build quality is good but its glossy plastic back is still not a winner for all
 its camera which has 8 M is good but not great considering others in this price brackets
 Also the screen resolution is not as good as the old moto g due to its larger screen size
 But still it is not just good but great at this prices
 its performance and the availability of pure Android is its biggest plus point
 its ability to handle high-def games is an added plus
 Of you have 15000 in your pocket look nowhere else Must go for it....

Raj Bhide
 Fundamentally I am Apple fan Started with scuffle and now have an iPhone, 2 heads etc
 But wanted a second phone hence thought of Moto G and Men off course after lot of research
 I will split my feedback in three areas 1. Flipkart Service - well excellent you buy they deliver on time or before time
 2. Moto G phone I am using this for a month now excellent phone
 But it took me time to get used to an non Apple phone
 Initially was frustrated with sound quality but realised that I have to hold it at a particular place and way and boom the sound was excellent
 The battery was also a huge issue draining at a speed higher than one can charge
 When I spent good amount of time on twitching off all unnecessary things on the phone and the battery back has been optimism to an extend that I have to charge once in two days
 His is for full usage for its purpose ice several con calls email updated etc
 I also used Jabber to login to meetings where the PPTwas being shared with the call which means very heavy usage of net to display put and the call worked very well as equivalent to my Apple the display is slightly better
 I delete all unwanted reloaded applications and stopped a few this optimism the storage
 I loaded all those applications that I usually use but still the external 16 os remains up utilised
 The front and back camera are very good it feels very comfortable to hold as well
 By conclusion you have to optimism the phone and learn to use it and this becomes an excellent phone
 3.
 His is where the conflict after using Apple IOS from the begning(I shifted from NOKIA very old hand set to shone os I am finding andros very clumsy and confusing
 Simple example if I have to switch off all modifications at one go I can do that at one go in Apple but in andros I have to visit each pp separately
 By final verdict if you want and excellent phone for usual office use with all relevant apes go for Moto G and genu
 Surely from operational perspective it is excellent value for money
 Disclaimer Apple vs andros is my personal opinion/perception, and hence I do not want to argue which one is better
}
{
Praveen Kumar Nir...
 His phone really has perfect speck of what all I needed
 In absolutely tempting phone to buy and yeah its worth buying
 The pro His phone got a great display processing good enough to play high end processing games without last nice camera,speakers on the front are good nice touch and great looking
 the sons the headphone provided is not that good not happy with it the battery should have been a little more accessories such as us cable not provided

Ishwar Bulbule
 His is my Review for Moto Os after using it for 2 months Display It has good display.Video quality is very sharp with great brightness
 Despite having gorilla glass 3 i have got a very small scratch on screen near bottom speaker.Great sensitivity , moto has rocked it
 inch display is perfect for one hand use
 Camera Dear Camera of moto go is decent than many other phone in same price range
 Camera interface is simple,effective and very easy to use.You need accurate settings for best pick from g2.Flash with auto settings hardly works so its up to u to keep it on or off
 Front Camera is imp which is very below average.It is pretty laggy.Hope they fix it in lollipop updated
 Speakers All quality is best in G2.With dual front speakers call quality is much better this category and phone in range of 25k-30k.
 Listening to music is great experience
 Watching video is amazing with front speakers though not as premium as HTC Dual boom speaker honest
 Performance West Performance in this category
 1.2ghz processor not the best but great performer as original moto go
 Most of games with medium or high quality graphics played good in likes of Head Trigger,NFS Most Wanted,Dark Night Rises,Batman Graham Origins
 Performance gets baggy when Os download are multitasked with games or other apply
 Connectivity: Connectivity of moto go is satisfactory.WiFi works great.Bluetooth and Os work fine
 Moto Os is worst for Os users.You should either have Os or iii for good,better or best experience on go
 Built apes like gmail,chrome,firefox,opera,play store,google drive,facebook,Google search dont even work on Os .
 They always say no connection with Os i.e,GPRS or EDGE.
 Memory It has 12gb internal memory use that for just Apps.
 I got myself 32gb sands ultra external micro card in Os for video and music
 Software Sure Android which is just amazing.Using Mitka 4.4.4 from day one which is great OS especially with phone with B RAM or less thought Os will get Lollipop update in Sov 2014 but it hasn arrived yet.Main reason is Motorola's Nexus 6 deal with Google stopping other moto phone from get 5.0.1 andros update.Just hoping them to give us soon
 Accessories: Headphones provided by moto are worst.They are equal to some china headphones with price 60Rs.
 on streets got myself a skullcandy headphone which works fantastic moto G2.Moto should learn from Bony about providing accessories.
 Battery Worst Battery performance ever is in Moto G2.Its not just my phone , I have seen 2-3 guns with worst battery performance.If Os or iii is on constantly battery drains very fast.If brightness is medium or high it drains very fast.You need to keep or phone on Os for better battery performance but again no many apes work on Os .
 With playing high end games battery will come from 100% to 30% in just 1 hour.Battery drains in medium rate during watching os video or playing music
 You either have to carry charger with u or power bank with you.G2 needs least 2 charging for a single day i.e.15 hours with videos,music,3G,wifi,nearing no gazing
 Hoping moto to improve battery performance in lollipop updated
 Motorola forgot that moto go is inch phone it is not 4.5inch moto go with both having same 2070mah battery which is enough for Os but not enough for G2.
 Conclusion It is great phone at great price with brand value than those who are no brand value like xiaomi or micromax.Good Smartphone go for it

{
Piyush Parmar
 its an excellent phone in this price range
 Great Camera fast processing and bright colours
 However I would like to advise everyone to buy Shone case/cover along with phone to protect it well
 Of you break your phone front glass you will have to replace entire screen module (Digitizer, front glass internal circuit etc which costs Os 7000.
 Motorola doesn replace only front glass it replaces entire screen module

 After a long gap of few years again bought a Motorola Shone
 Honestly i am pleased that this phone has the same standard as the earlier motorola phone had
 Being part of motorola for over a decade i know the stringent process they follow
 Over all happy with phone and any one wanting to buy a "STOCK ANDROID" phone please go for it
 Your device will be fist to get the latest andros updates...
 Os this phone takes in micro him i got one of my SIM cut and one exchanged with micro him from AIRTEL.
 But the experiment worked out i see a 50% drop on the cut him compared with real micro SIM.
 To please spare some extra bucks and get a micro him rather than cutting it
 Os usual got the delivery in flash time booked on an Wednesday afternoon and got it Thursday morning 9.00 am at my door steps
 Deep it up Flipkart !!!

 I bought moto g and gen from flipkart and when i switched it on for the first time out of the box i was shocked that it had a screen with yellow tinge instead of white
 i requested replacement from flipkart with request to ensure that the second peace does not come with the same fault
 but my doubt came true as the replaced piece also came with the same hardware fault idea screen with yellow tinge
 also after 4 days use the replaced phone on/off button and volume button have started sobbing and loosely fitted i dont think they will last more than 6 months
 now again i called flipkart and they asked me to visit service center and told me in clear terms that replacement is not an option unless the service centre acknowledges that there is fault with the screen
 imagine the pathetic logic of flipkart that a customer is asked to go to service centre for a product which was faulty straight out of the box
 now guns the thing is flipkart delivers poor quality product twice and then i am at the mercy of motorola's service centre to get the fault acknowledged in short customer is always wrong at first instance unless acknowledged by its bands service centre
 this is the situation shippers have been facing while shopping in our country whether you buy from a shop in your town or from online site
 i suggest fellow customers to think twice before buying moto g and gen unless they are ok with yellow screen instead of whit and with poorly fitted buttons
 P.S.
 I compared the screen of both the phone delivered to me with the moto g and gen of my friend who bought it 3-4 months back and he has a perfect white screen

 I bought this phone 4 months ago
 It has been a good experience
 The screen is just the right size for all my uses
 The phone never laws when I play games on it
 The camera quality is satisfactory however I would have preferred it be of a higher resolution
 The touchscreen is highly susceptible to fingerprints, forcing me to use a screenguard.
 Also the battery only lasts for 12-13 hours after being fully charged

{
Tejinder Singh
 compared to moto g st gen only thing which is less in level of quality is the speakers and sound producing power through headsets in go i found the volume is little loud than go but go has sterno sound system which is a good point and i also found,with the same set of earphone there senneheiser cx-180),that go produced louder voice than go even though i turned off the equaliser but after all this this is better phone than go because it is also cheaper than go with more features

Md Zeeshaan
 I bought this phone on two months back after lot of research reading reviews from flipkart and other phone review sites but i would like to point out few issues which you will find only after you use and will not find in many review sites
 I am an average user not many games just online news reading and video watching and general use
 Firstly prose 1. Sleek and attractive design
 2.Good Cam(Above Average low light images are also decent 3.Sound clarity good(people had complained about it but sound is quite loud and enough 4.Performance is spectacular,any not of apes can be loaded and it will perform superbly.
 Hardly ever the phone had hanged
 5.Display is excellent
 6.GPS is excellent Now cost 1.
 I am not able to save any apes or media on sd cards i dont understand why the provision is there when u canst use it.(of
 course u can save cam pick and video on it but not download video or music.To do so you have to root the device with some pp but I was sceptical, so i didn't.)
 2.Battery back is the main problem with this phone if you didn charge your phone to full capacity before leaving for officer then you are in trouble.Full battery hardly lasts for 16hrs,(with To data usage that may be because of conductivity issues
 3.If the phone gets switched off , some times it happens that it will not switch on even after charging for 15-20 mind apparently there is some celebration problem with the phone.(This
 u will not find in any review sites 4. Of the face of the phone is placed touching the body part in pocket it gets heated up to uncomfortable levels this is scars me at times 5.
 You canst assign your favorite song as ringtone,this is annoying and i dont know why even basic phone have this facility
 6.
 I noticed battery performance is good on wife than on 3g.(this may be common It is better to go for lucia phone by spending an extra 2-3k rupees.
 Hope this is useful

 Good phone overall animation lag a they tiny bit but you wont notice it unless your used to ask honest
 I get around 5 hours of screen on time on go which is decent I guess nothing spectacular
 Pp load snappily, but it has only 1 os of memory so yeah apes will start at times while multitasking, if you have a lot of them open
 Of you like stock android, you'll love this phone
 A very good buy for the prices
 Of your buying this phone dont bother getting a screen guards been using it without one for 3 months and not a single scratch
 His doesn make it shatterproof thought get a case if you have clumsy hands!).
 Survived more than a couple of drops but I doubt if the screen will hold up if I drop it face down like any other phone it will probably shatter
 The screen is sharp alright in bright light but viewing angles are pretty poor although its an IPS LCD.
 Display colours and crisp and natural looking no oversaturated nonsense
 His is one of the few phone were I noticed the auto brightness works perfectly
 Still waiting for the lollipop update thought you think Motorola phone would be the first to receive it after Nexus but its January already

 Moto g and gen is pretty good... it feels a bit huge... and one of the main problem with this phone is that It wont connect to windows 8.1 thou USB.." it wont get detected at all days the probe with windows not the phone still the Motorola device manager does not work too for this phone on win 8.1... sound quality is a bit dull and does not feel good with the head phone took but good for using other apps.... battery drains pretty soon and needs a long to time to charge the whole thing up again..... consider before buying

 I ordered a Moto G and generation with December 2014 and got it delivered on st January 2015.
 The earphones did not work and got the replacement on th An 2015.
 Once again thanks for quicker delivery
 After 23 days of usage touch screen at the bottom does not work and I see in the black background the screen gets fading out
 I was very much satisfied with Flipkart since started using from 2012 and nowadays very much totally disappointed with flipkart products about the product quality
 I DOUBT WHETHER FLIPKART os SELLING GENUINE PRODUCTS or its Moto G Made in China causing product issues being Flipkart the major imported of Moto products
 Have raised a ticket on this issue
 os I os NOT GETTING SATISFACTORY SOLUTION I WOULD BETTER PREFER RETURN THE PRODUCT AND GET os 13K MONEY REFUNDED.
 Mind attention to new buyers Letter go to the stores and buy the products

 Flipkart is cheating customers with faulty Moto G devices...
 Even after 2 consecutive replacement the device does not work
 I am created of my money and still no solution has been provided

Amardeep Mandr...
 got the phone for a 4000 os discount thanks a lot flipkart... firstly the phone is beautifully elegant the finishing and craftsmanship is very impressive
 this give the phone a very polished and a very premium look
 been using it for the past 1 weeks and so far enjoying every bit of it now a breakup of summary
 PROS: the 294ppi display is a mesmerizing thing to look at very good viewing angles and very crisp display
 os 1.2 GHZ quand core processor is a mighty beast can run multiple apes without any last
 os the Adreno GPU is just a delight all recent high end games work but best in medium settings
 ) os Camera... where do i even begin the 8MP snapped is the standout feature of this device can record video in 720p only but that is not a let down images captured are brilliant and very much comparable to a low end dslr... the front cam is just the iting on the cake images are just as good
 os Storage is greatly improved with the provision of os card Clot
 os charging time is greatly reduced from a standard charger supplied the device charges in little less than 90 Sins
 a very good things CONS: os Battery could have been better the 2070mah battery lasts only for 13-15 his even on moderate internet usage
 os the Available RAM should have been least 1.5 GB, not that it is a major problem ... os I noticed the charger heat up at times not sure if a faulty charge or due to quick charging... OVERALL: a good buy definitely go for it wont be disappointing

 I first got this phone delivered to me on 30.12.14 and unfortunately I had to go switch on the Talk Back feature on the phone
 Hats it
 By phone went for a royal toss and I had to return the products
 But hey that happens and Flipkart was just awesome to give me a replacement within the next 2 days
 Its a good phone after all
 Not every phone works Now that I have my new phone let me provide my views Pros:- Smooth and fast browsing (facebook and whatsapp is just super smooth to use Thanks to Kitkat.
 Camera is just awesome front and back Almost every game can be played
 Amazing type experience
 Voice clarity is simply superb and it doesn hurt the ears
 The headphones provided serves the purpose really well
 And yes it can be upgrade to Lollipop.
 Easy to hold and mainly easy to type
 Said not find any difficulty Huge internal memory of 16GB and os card unto 64 os Cons:- Battery life is very less
 And the fact that it is built makes it a lot more skeptically
 Take sure you own a power bank
 Os mentioned above os NOT SWITCH os the TALK BACK FEATURE.
 Getting connected to a computer might be a bit of a confusion at the beginning but I am sure people will get used to it within a day or two
 In the whole a very good product that is worth your money spent
 To for it
 You will not regret!!!!

 all try to list its points prose 1. Sleek look 2. Vice camera
 3. Superb performance
 4. To last 5. 16GB internal memory external slot available
 6. Good display
 Sons 1.
 The only bad thing I can say about this is that the speakers agent too great
 Yes they can provide surround sound effect but only unto a very small range
 To the only negative would be the Speakers
 I would definitely tell others to busy this

 phone is performing well and smart

 Battery quality great and i charge only time for two days
 Believe me it works
 i just drained out battery two times as per friends advice and do not complete charging cycle everytime.
 Camera quality is good and works on type calls
 The shape is curly and great looking
 You can watch moves haste free and no hang up as on date
 Of you are looking for a budget phone then Moto G and Men is the best

 The Shone is good
 But I got a faulty piece
 All speaker both apiece & Loudspeaker) is not working sometimes
 The problem is solved after a device restarted but it reappear again after some time
 And also I got a damaged back shell
 The former problem , i think its a software problem as the speakers are fine during media playback & the problem is only during the calls
 However I have initiated a replacement request and my replacement is on its way
 all put the detailed review after i receive the replacement
 Will now him satisfied with the flipkart service
 Overall Review * Build Quality is superb * Sterno speakers give superb audit experience * Battery is Average * Camera is some for this prices Both Front and Heard * Shone is more handy compared to other phone with os display * RAM should've been better But canst complain because of its budget price * Processor is awesome ... To lag in response found * Display is of premium quality compared to phone in similar price range * Sure Android experience ( To much useful apes from MOTO) * want change the font style without footing , Unlike from Samsung phone * To Overhearing experienced * 13GB is available for apes ( There no pp specific memory user can use the memory according to them , that is for apes or medial
 * Charger that came with the phone is disappointing as its so slow in charging take nearly 4 hours for a full charge and it heat too much

 Added to that backside cover on the top right side is not getting locked properly

 There is every chance that dust gets going inside
 After spending 1299 Os i am totally disappointed on seeing such poor quality of back cover
 I would be my time waste if have to take it for Motorolla for repairing the back cover

 Great look .

 His is the worst service that one could ever think off.The product i receive is damaged and also doesn include all its accessories and the only available accessory is the charger which is white in colour while the phone is black....hence i doubt if i have received a used phone or a phone which was returned by someone else...... Flipkart is taking an advantage since they are the only authorized sellers for this Shone -MotoG I ordered a phone on 30-Dec'14 was wanting it so much that i even speed for a speedy delivery by am extra payment
 I receive the phone on 31-Dec'14 and to my great surprise i see that the SIM Clot is damaged...which left me dumstruck not even wanting to use the phone any longer i report the case immediately to the customer care who are so negligent...each one of them just want to pass the ball from their court..thats all is what they are concerned at wanting me to wait for call from the teach team for the next 24hrs who will then understand what is my concer...Is this how they treat the customers when they advertise for their products???? ...i receive a call at 10.30am i-Jan'15; when i am in a meeting hence ask the technical executive to stay on line for 10min,refuses to do so and offers call back at am and the story ends there..... i don receive any call after that...and i callback the teach team multiple times to hear their slogan The are sorry for the inconvenience the issue is excavated they will call u in not 24hrs however we cannot assure the call back today
 Am fed up hearing the some thing i even doubt if this is recorded..... Since i din want to use the damaged phone i did not even check the box and frustrated with their service when i finally decide to use the phone with the SIM Clot working i notice that even the headsets are missing!!!!!! and the phone ordered is black in colour and the only available accessory is the charger which is white in colour

 His definitely the best andros based phone in the sub 15000/- range
 It uses basic Android skin who any alteration of superficial skin
 I would recommend this one over the other cheap and useless chinese read xiaomi) phone in the market

 One more thing the Original Moto G lip covers even tough a bit expensive but they are of very very good quality and a must to save your phone from jerks and scratches

 It first I contracted to Moto customer care but they could not do solve my problem on phone in spite of several efforts and then they advised me to go any near service centre
 But on contracting to Flipkart, initially tried to solve my problem and after then promised to replace my mobile with new one
 Soon I will get new one and hope it will be OK.
 I personally feel Flipkart maintains its reputation and tries the best

 His mobile would have easily retained for more than 16K had it been available outside Flipkart.
 Super andros device with everything working fearlessly that you can think of
 I am not a camera so excuse me on that front
 But after a very very bitter experience with Samsung Trend this phone is breeze of fresh air
 Camera is excellent to say the least
 It takes breathtaking images in normal indoor lighting at night
 Skin tone is superb
 Flipkart delivered it to me in less than 36 hours from Bangalore to Hyderabad.

 His is really a good phone.Its very smooth to use.every thing works fine but only some features are missing in marking feature of contacts(ie selecting many contact and adding them to group or meeting them),voice recorder etc.....

 Ordered the phone on 22/Dec/15 and got it in one day 23/Dec/14 I bought this phone in Exchange offer to my old Samsung Galaxy LCD First Generation).
 I got 3000 Os for the old phone which was very good
 I have been using this phone for more than a week PROS: os Screen Resolution is Amazing and 5 inch phone looks very good
 I have compared it to Nexus 5 and Moto Os looks 80 percent of Nexus 5 - 5/5 os Camera clarity is simply mind blowing and its a awesome 8MP Dear camera
 - 5/5 os Front Speakers are good - 4/5 os Response time is very good and apes open immediately and no lag is found - 5/5 os Gaming - Played Temple run 2 and subways suffer without any hiccups - 5/5 os Lollipop - Eagerly waiting for lollipop Upgrade
 CONS: BATTERY: Battery is average
 For every min of internet browsing you will loose os of battery and Moto g 2 should have provided 3000mAH Battery
 But is is far better than phone 4. I have installed Battery Waver Pp and after that Am able to control the Battery
 Also bought os Powerbank so Am relieved and does not have check my battery all the time
 Eagerly waiting for lollipop Upgrade and maybe battery condition will improve

 this is very good phone but one day my phone is not working i

Ausaf Rahman
 I am still a user of the Moto G st Men I bought the and Men for my brother Obviously Os is better thanks to its screen size
 The only difference between the two phone is the battery back which is better in the st Men External slot doesn really matter because they os harm the phone in many ways
 I too would have bought the Os but what held me back are the speakers
 Of Motorola would have continued the same model with just the size updated it would have been so much better
 Those speakers are really ugly os I just hope Motorola Nobility or Lenovo, whoever wears the parts in the family now does not continue with those speakers for the next phone to be released by them and even if they do please manufacture with a colour like metallic grey which camouflages those speakers
 To sum it up MotoG2 is still the real MVP !!!

 Thanks to Flipkart for timely delivery of this product within a day
 I was planning to buy Us zenfone 5 or readmit
 Finally after a proper assessment decided to go with MOTO G 2. His Shone may not be the best in various areas However it is the best in all round performance at this Price when compared to any other Shone below ask rupees.
 To if you are looking for a good brand phone with maximum features and good battery back go for MOTO G and Men os I will soon be getting Android Lollipop on By MOTO G and GEN.
 Also MOTO G and GEN battery charges very quickly ( within 1-1.5 hours 100% ) and lasts for nearly 24 hours at moderate usage
 other features are already mentioned by many buyers
 Thank you FLIPKART os

saurabh ghare
 as per my view when this phone launched had a certain possession with this phone
 when I heard about exchange offer i felt lucky
 His phone you have to buy 5 inch os display 1.2 Processor,11 os pp memory Excellent sound quality,4.4.4 mitka version,awesome self camera But the main disadvantage is RAM .
 Am is only 1 os instead of giving 2 GB.otherwise in migrate price phone.This is the best Shone

 worst experience for bad battery back up

 I dont know why Flipcart or Moto people are considering concern and try to rectify problems observed

 After 6 days of use I find Moto G is excellent phone by Motorola which is the first company to make cellular honest
 Motorola is also American company recently bought by Google), you can compare its build quality with Apple
 I also happen to have Pad In 2 Retina display
 1. Shone function 5/5 Clear audit quality
 I used to get poor signal with my old Samsung Galaxy R at home but now that problem is solved
 Thanks to Android 4.4.4
 you have simplifies view of contact call log
 But message log and call log are separated
 Nowadays sums use is lesser
 Hardly anyone mentions this feature which is still very relevant today
 Any high end phone have complicated calling function
 2. Display 5/5 294 pp to be exact
 Small forts can be read without eye strain
 By Pad In 2 Retina has 324 pp and you CAN'T tell difference
 Now there are phone with 500 pp displays but you wont notice these tiny pipes beyond human eye capacity 3. Battery 4/5 I get unto 2 days as my use is less
 But heavy user can get a days backup.
 4. Camera 5/5 Impressive photos in low light
 Takes multiple shots per second
 It makes sure you get a perfect snap in sports or when moving speedily
 5. Original Android, Google now 5/5 6. White LED ratification Good feature for those who dont check phone constantly
 You can set for just personal message in WhatsApp or a missed call etc 7. Build quality 5/5 Letter than Samsung, close to Apple but without metallic back
 8. Design 5/5 Slightly curved back with matter finish helps gripping
 Shone is not too think
 Too thin phone are difficult to hold
 By Pad is thin and slightly uneasy to hold
 Other important features are Gorilla glass Android 5 updated Motorola brandy
 And it is almost a budget phone costing 13k.
 Only thing is to be seen is how Motorola service is
 I hope it will hardly be needed

Partha Sarathi...
 Ought this on its launch day itself... have been using for over 3 months till now no issues like hanging or heating as such other than battery running out soon when using Os network but that just andros & Moto's way of telling you keep your charger close by phone comes loaded with most of the features which are generally abundant in all other bands so not much to tell camera is decent so is the dual sterno speakers they are loud but who plays music on mobile phone speakers other than plug the headphones.. the packing comes very simple & there no data cable which is a big negative point if you dont have any lying around I already had 2-3 so no worries there the headphones provided inside are very basic variety you would do better to buy a good one separately I use Effusion Twinwoofers with Poweramp so music listening is awesome... picture quality is clear & bright even when the brightness is turned down a lot... i dont use any screen guard as the screen comes with gorilla glass 3 which does its work pretty decently... till now no judges or scratches on the phone or maybe I keep my phone safe from all that Flipkart delivery was late by 2 days but packing was good... overall a good phone to invested Update - Sky after upbraiding to Android Lollipop.. have noticed severe drop in battery life
 Now a full charge lasts max 5-8 hour with just music listening & minor surging on Os & whatsapp & ff chat apply
 I use a separate cell for phone calls... earlier it would last at least 16 hours upbraiding to lollipop has sure made the UI look much cooper but the battery life is something to be wondered about Motorola should look into it asap..

 Fellow its been more then two months I am using this phone
 I am moderate user not a gaming freeze and the phone is going quite well for me except many minor but irritating drawback
 Rose 1. Master piece in price range 2. Looks extremely good Os caught black color hands with two additional original back cover and it looks great 3. Does'nt hang in moderate usage am not gaming free but dozen of pp runs in my phone all the time 4. Latest andros OS 5. Camera is fast 6. Good quality sound
 Sons 1. Camera is not great in night/dull light
 That it shows in display is not as same as what it captures
 2. Room in / Room out pinch gesture is irritating and doesn work smoothly
 Issue with the default pp 3. SPEAKERS CANNOT os TURN os while listening to RADIO.
 not sure if this is the hardware issue or the default pp issue 4. Some time while listening to music on headphones if you erect to move to speakers it doesn work or there is a reduction in volume
 you need to pause and resume and speakers starts working 5. Buttons on earphone call pick/drop/change song/adjust volume doesn work
 6. War phone shipped with the product is of cheap quality
 7.
 There is os NEXTLINE KEY in the keyboard
 not sure it is OS issue I am using 4.4.4)
 His makes extremely unpleasant while testing

 I was planning to buy a good Android mobile phone from quite some time but I was confused between Us Zenphone 5 & Moto G2.
 But later I decided to go with Moto Os for 2 reasons - - Good Exchange offer ( I got Os exchange price for my 3 year old Samsung Have Y ) - Moto Os will get 5.0.1 update in next months
 Moto Os doesn look like a big phone its easy to hold in one hand and screen resolutions are really good
 Battery performance is good and I didn face any issue in last one weeks
 The only complain I have from Moto Os that it doesn have data cable and good quality earphone.

 I had bought my phone Moto G Second Generation white from flipkart in month of October and due to some reasons mobile screen has been cracked and i gave it to near by service center they said that should change panel and it cost me seven thousand rupees.
 I gave my mobile and money to service center people at first they said that they will get it repair with in one week and now it is one month every time they say that company doesn have white panel they only have black panel wait for another week and this story continued for one month and there is no result
 if company is not in a position to produce white panel then what is the need of producing the white phone and marketing them
 To please be careful before going to buy this mobile

 I have bought the product on first day with introductory offers
 It has bigger screen and expandable memory over previous generation Moto go
 A great device to buy for first time andros user
 Display 5 inch display is very bright & with vivid and punch colors but only 720p which is okay considering prices
 Great for watching video
 Processor To upgrade in processor but still a sappy device
 To hiccups or clashes with day to day pp usage
 OS: Dear pure andros experience which i love very much
 Waiting for Lollypop 5.0 Camera Recent camera
 Images are noisy (grainy) in less light
 Clash is K types
 Battery Enough for day and half with moderate usage only 2G, no 3G) Round Front facing sterno speakers is a bonus but goodness is less
 A disappointment
 Problems Seats up while normal gaming also like subways suffer etc

 After usage of 2.5months, it has been a good experience with Moto Os Need to look at some pro and sons as below Rose Vice display Vice Camera but not as much level we used to have with Samsung, LG.

 Performance is not took good but we could say ok if we compare with the same budget honest

 Its 1.2 z Had More power pack is really fast and does not laws at all with 1 os RAM and 16 os Internal and has a micro os card sloth
 I installed almost 20 apes in it with a ease and it does not last
 Its 8MP rear and 2MP front camera are impressive and able to click some really nice shots
 In a nutshell its a good phone to buy and recommends this to all

 Yes now time is correct to change name FLIPKART os FLOPKART.
 Reason:- os They people think that customer is stupid
 Obvious yes cause we are buying from FLOPKART.COM.
 Never buy any phone in an exchange offer
 Because they will not accept the phone in the exchange offer without any reason
 os Rude illiterate Courier boy zero knowledge about the products
 Very busy and no time for customers
 os Extremely slow and non-responsive customer care service
 Why cause they take unto one week to update simple order status
 os FLOPKART is totally professional in harassing the customers
 Note I had bought lots of products and had lots of trust on FLIPKART.
 But now a days they dont care about customer anymore Must care about passing them off
 Never buy FLOPKART.COM

 Its a really good mid level smartphone.
 Its just 3 days happened
 To far no complaints
 Totally in love with this phone
 Problem is with delivery guns
 I purchased this mobile on EMI.. on Delivery day they called me and asked where I'm?
 I told in some abc restaurant then they requested well come to that restaurant within halfway hour not to your address just co restaurant is on the way to my home so no need to travel unto my home Called at 12:30PM, even they have care I told okay told YES just because they requested a lot
 after that I waited 2 hours in that restaurant They dint come I gone to my home(2PM).
 After halfway hour(2:30PM) they called and told well be at that restaurant within 5 minutes
 I told I waited for 2 hours now deliver to my home
 They told Os Of you want come else sorry
 He canst come to your address
 I gone to that abc restaurant again
 There hers scolding me just co I was not there and told we are donna return back your product to flipkart by signing "Customer's Unavailable" if it happens again
 OMG!!! him really confused
 In phone he requested he canst come unto my home address and now hers blaming for the change of address
 him really requesting flipkart people to tell Part delivery guns Must to deliver to given address not calling and requesting to come to some other places just because they canst travel far
 Because we guns are already paid money through Debit/Credit cards and waiting for products
 from now on all do cash on delivery
 Of something like this happens next time him donna return the products
 In that case blame your delivery guns not buyers
 Packaging was so good from flipkart and the offers what they given for that smartphone I got it
 Thanks flipkart except in the matter of delivery guns
 By 2 stars for flipkart and products

 I bought moto G wit great hope
 But after 2 days found 1. battery was so worse that if u will not do anything with screen off it consumed 8-10%.
 if u want to play games or brows internet have or charges nearby always
 2. Network problems it can only he network at only very good network otherwise when my samson mobile with same him and same location shows good signal strength and this moto g shows " Emergency calls only
 West is gud.. if u want not to call any body chat or browsing u can go with this mobile because u will not find not network neither battery backup.

 His is one of the best smart phone in range of 15K.
 I bought it and I am happy to use it
 I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars because all I needed was an andros default launched for Android vr.4.4.4 but all other moto system upgrades,the default launched will be replaced with the goose now launched
 Although its not a desert I have checked it completely and found it to be a useful device... That I checked that other critics or buyers were saying a lot about its low voice from speakers not so good display and a bad battery backup.
 in By Moto g and Generation has an awesome display with everything good brightness contrast colors etc iii By Moto Os has an amazing voice clarity form speakers even if I listen to any music or play any game (RipTide os 2).
 iii By Moto Os with 100% battery lasts unto 6-8 hours if continuously used
 Its a merit cause as fas as I have tested so many andros honest they doesn lasts for even 5 hours when used continuously
 Of you can afford it then you should buy it cause its the best among the best
 Although it has a good competitor that is he 616, but still all advice you to buy this.....
 Os already said that it is West out of bests".
 Even a title to Moto Os was given by so many magazines and newspapers it was "POOR PEOPLE's NEXUS", so Moto Os can be easily title as "POOR PEOPLE's NEXUS6 os
 I guarantee

 Moto Os is really a great phone with amazing performance camera display and storage space...
 I recommend Moto G2, if the price range is 12 - 15K...

 I bought Moto G and Men in the month of Sept'14 - expecting a great phone from Motor
 From the day one i have been facing a issue of battery back - hardly four to five hours
 Now its time to invest in mobile phone as some couple of other problem developed - like slow response delay response
 Of you are looking for good battery life & faster response - it would be advisable to look for all other option
