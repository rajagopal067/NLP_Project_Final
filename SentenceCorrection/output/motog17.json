 I ordered this phone on must october 2014.
 didn receive till th nov 2014.
 To i excavated the complaint
 they said it will be resolved on or before with of novo
 They acted smartly by concealing the order and defending the products
 That a fantastic customer service !!!!!#$#%$TR%$%^$%#$ His system force me to give a rating
 so i gave 1. but actually it is 0 for flipkart

 I bought the Moto G and Men around Diwali and its just been 2 weeks while i write this review that I have been using this phone
 It fantastic
 The experience of an andros from windows is fantastic
 Not that windows was bad andros is better
 The phone is sleek very light fast and user friendly
 The battery lasts a full 24 hours even after i use the phone apes to the fullest
 I would recommend the phone to all
 Also Flipkart service is great as always

 Pathetic phone 1/5 rating Volume button rocks and is not fitted properly....
 While on call if there is a ratification the speaker makes a very painful loud noise....
 And after using the phone for 5-6 days all of a sudden the phone stops working and is not twitching off even after repeated charging.... Flipkart service (1/5 - All they had to do was deliver)..!! Flipkart 1 day guaranteed delivery is a joke..!!
 After waiting for the entire day when I called the courier delivery person I was told that You need to come and collect the packet from our office"..
 Even after telling them multiple times that I had speed for express delivery still I had to go and collect the packet from their officer Saying for os day delivery Total waste of money..Dont fall into the trap..!!
 For the return and replacement of the defeated phone I have placed a request twice already but no response yet Greatly disappointed by the product and the service....!!

 i bought this phone in flipkart two weeks before .
 its nice good screen clarity .
 speakers are also good
 camera is ok but good for that prices
 touch sensitivity could be much better but oka
 proximity senior is slow
 battery life is good
 ring tone comes after some rising .
 ringtone rising issue is der.bad
 headphones and charger could develop that quality overall good for beginners in andros and mid range users under 15 k

 Were I come with an in detail review
 Initially I was afraid the phone was getting charged slowly
 The mistake I made was that I was that I didn charged phone completely on the first date
 Now everything is working fine once I charged completely whole day
 It is worth for the money you pay
 However I flipkart replaced my phone but there is a new problem I am facing now
 I can see lot of pipes in the camera it was no there in the original item
 I am afraid that flipkart is sending me only defective problems
 I have bought two moto go phone on flipkart, one is for me and one is for my dad
 By days phone just works fine but my phone is all defective product dont know if flipkart is getting only faulty products
 Also., now I am waiting for the flipkart technical team to call me
 The issue is excavated to concerned department
 Once I hear from them I will update my review here
 ***Updated for a month*** His phone is working fine with great camera clarity with Camera 360 application
 I like it
 Even the battery is perfect now I am getting a decent battery back up
 Rose Vice display Good clarity of both the camera For less price you'll get branded mobile Moto and Nexus are the phone which gets pure stock andros and andros updated
 Sons Less battery back (2040 mAH) you'll get hardly one day back if your not a frequently user
 Shone is just works fine and it is totally worth for money unless it is defective products

 Worst delivery process : Flipkart is good for Retro cities where product might be delivered by day-end.
 But it becomes hell for small cities or towns
 Lots of communication issues long expected delivery gap product cracking issues etc can make any buyer frustrated
 Mostly Damage-Repair charges : For Moto G st Generation if your screen gets damaged it may coast around INR 5100 and for Moto G and Generation around INR 7000.
 Not a comfortable deal
 os Camera Hang issue : During capturing images it becomes frustrating, when screen gets hanged
 When I have to start the camera to use it
 Os if you prepare to buy it make yourself ready for all those issues
 Part from it I am experiencing a bad Moto Are service facility took
 It need improvement

 About Products Mobile is good
 But the charger gone in just few days
 About Flipkart: its quality has practically reduced.Be careful about the discount they offer
 His product I had to order for and time
 st time when I ordered after 15 days suddenly the order got canceled
 I was told that courier company was not able to deliver the products
 Same address I got many products from FlipKart previously
 Again I booked and got the product delivered in 2 days time
 To when you book a product keep in mind that you might not get the product at the same price.It might get canceled and you need to book again

 I have received the mobile well before the date promised by Flipkart..
 I appreciate that Regarding the mobile it is having a worst battery back up after charging the mobile for 3 hours long it gives a great back of 3 hours... Flipkart is having a 30-day exchange policy but of no use since if we place a request they will extend and extend the process and at the end they will tell you that this is not inside the 30-day exchange period.." i dont know why these people want to make fool the customers
 Of you are not guarantee about the product please do not put any offers like these and give wrong ideas to the customers

Chintan
 I bought this phone on th Act "THE BIG BILLION DAY".
 I was eagerly waiting for my new phone however it was delivered 1 day late i was bit disappointed
 Moto G and Men look is great performance is good but when I play game Real Facing for 1-2 hours battery goes down in 6-7 hours including normal use in rest of hours (i.e.
 internet
 The main problem is with its ear phone the one comes with the phone
 I can hear voice clearly even with max volume
 I have to join calls at any time working on lawton and Os I prefer ear phone so I can work easily
 I have to press it in my ear that helps me understanding what the person is saying
 it hurts...

 Firstly - Flipkart-awesome customer satisfaction as always was bang on time delivery
 Secondly - Amazing Shone with the best price in market for the features it delivers
 The touch sense is great battery back is decent was per the usage camera quality amazing music sound great memory capacity is very very nice
 Very light weight easy to handle
 And the best thing is this phone does not have any irrelevant features which most of the time we dont use
 All the feature that are built are apt and direct
 Over all a good deal at a best prices

 Guys, I would like to inform you that I think Moto G so called Gorilla GLASS 3 is much more delicate that it can even with stand the pressure/force for normal day to day use
 I had bought Moto G(2nd Gen).Black on 19-09-2014 and on last Friday (07-11-2014) it developed some airline crack at the bottom just above the bottom speaker
 And on Saturday (08-11-2014) it developed one more crack perpendicular to this crack running from first crack to till top speaker
 I have not yet contracted service center and am not sure whether this will be repaired or not free of charge within warranty time as this not physical damage as it not subjected to any forces from outside like dropping or throwing etc.., Hope this will be resolved free of charge
 Guys, He careful Moto Os so much delicate that it is not up to the mark of not even close to Gorilla GLASS 3 tags
 Compared my previous Foka Gumma 800 Gorilla glass which was so much strong that I used to give domo of Gorilla glass like the way in Couture and it never broke until recently when it broke in some major road accident which made me to change cell phone
 I thought of trying Android cell i found Moto Os of little worth for Rs13000.
 When I got the Moto Os some how i felt its not that good as to be called as Gorilla Glass
 To i was using very much carefully
 But to my bad luck it had developed some crack(not visible from top and when I visited service centre they told me that it is beyond warranty(all physical damages even though it is not done by me by any means and said it will cost me Rs7000.
 His is too much
 I have contracted Motorola customer care
 Hope it will be repaired at no extra cost to me
 Of not all be going to consumer court
 That I say is if you people assuming that it is having Gorilla Glass as feature and buying means its total waste of money
 I feel Moto Os Gorilla glass is so much brittle that you can use it for day to day not usage
 It has to be just put in some museum after buying so that it should not break
 I will be posting more details about repair status or Service centre response regarding the same

 Rose Excellent build quality
 It fell down from a flight of stairs (5-6 ftp and nothing happened
 Must a minor scratch on the body and that it
 Voice and decent camera for its prices
 -Android mitka with guaranteed updated to andros lollipop.
 -Stereo speakers and that too on the front side with is very helpful
 The speaker quality is just fine
 Would be better
 Display is very nice
 Although its only 720p he but there is no sign of pixelation.
 -Motorola trust
 Sons - Suffers a little lag sometimes when multitasking.
 Result of its 1.2 go processor
 -5" display may seem a little large at first but you soon get used to it and then it feels like a boone

 It look over price but it not...fells class on my hand
 i got the black one earlier i used to get confused which one is the top and bottom as the hearing and talking point are the same
 the only think to disappoint was there was nothing free product with the phone neither the lip cover nor the memory card and not even the screen guards
 every thing u have to buy

 Ordered one online paid extra and got delivery same day
 Excellent product as per many reviews with many pro and few sons 1. battery back needs improvement 2. even with a black color phone still shipping white headphones and white charger 3. UI does not have quick wi-fi, auto rotate on/off etc so needed to download apes 4. in calls everyone on the listening side complained of low voice even though i was speaking in the mice
 finally did some research and increased the gain on the audit to fix this issue as well as low volume in recording

 For those who are your average users idea just internet based usage like facebook / whatsapp , surging and emails.. look no further
 I dont do any heavy gaming os just your subways suffer or candy crush types
 I have been using this phone for 2 weeks now and am extremely happy about it
 Music sounds better if you get some proper headphones than the ones shipped with this phone
 I was an shone user and was concerned about shelling out another high amount on a phone
 Took a chance on this budget and am really impressed
 One concern is the sleek body sometimes feels as though your about to drop it....so would recommend getting a back cover with a proper grip
 The display is really good
 Heating issues yeah too much of Os arms the phone up a bit but I have seen the same on almost every other model i have had a chance to lay my hands on

 When it comes to the Moto Os every review talks about how great this phone is at this PRICE POINT.
 To me this is a great phone..PERIOD.
 I have not LOVED a phone this much since my Samsung Galaxy S2.
 I have used Armies for a long time now and I was curious to see what ask got Os off on this on the Fig Million offer on exchange of my wife old Bony Ericsson Peri mind pro would get me
 Boy was I pleasantly surprised
 The Moto G (2) looks as decent and the build quality is as good as any other phone out there
 Only the power and volume rocket keys feel a bit flies but do their job perfectly well love the curved rubberized back and the phone feels just right in the hand
 It feels so compact in the hand for a 5 inches especially when compared to the Samsung Grand dust
 Now great is that splash screen on boot up
 The screen is clear and sharp and while the colors dont POP they are natural quite like the HTC palette.
 Everything on this phone just WORKS and works QUICK!
 There is no lag whatsoever after a month of use
 I was frankly concerned about the 1 gig of RAM but there seems to be no need whatsoever for more
 I dont use the phone for gaming so I cannot comment on that
 I cannot understand why most reviews talk about potential battery life issues just because of the bigger screen
 I am getting more than 24 hours with wife 3 go location services and bluetooth on permanently
 I charge the phone for a couple of hours in the evening and by next evening i still have 25-50% charge left
 Stock Android It At flies through every multi task.There is no bloatware and the few preinstalled Motorola apes are actually useful
 I do miss some of the shortcuts wipe to call and text etc and other extra While browser, lip to silence that came with Touchwiz but its certainly something I can live with given the sheer speed with which everything gets done
 Connectivity is fantastic..leave everything on and it fearlessly switches between If and 3G, and bluetooth goes into a low power standby state when not connected to a haired device
 The camera is decent and very quick to start up
 I actually like the Motorola camera pp because it lets you access and change the settings very quickly and access to the gallery from within the camera pp is just one wipe away
 In phone editing option are good as well
 The front facing sterno speakers while short on bass are loud and clear
 The bundles headphones went straight into the bind but lets face it even an iPhone's stock buds are no good
 One final point and this is something that no one seems to care about these days...this, after all is A PHONE, and when used as a phone the call clarity is EXCELLENT, enough to put those costing 3 times as much to shame
 Motorola, in Google's hands has really done an impressive job with this one
 That the future holds under Novo only time will tell
 Of they can keep this up Os for one will never blow my hard earned money on a "flagship" phone again

 Have used this product for more than a month.... Regarding the specification everybody,am not going to in detail about them its camera quality is good.It'll take decent pick
 Regarding gaming,I am not a game at all..but tried shalt 8 and need for speed most wanted and if 14,All are pretty decent,works smoothly....
 And the battery,one of the biggest problem in android,But the Moto G can give up to around 15 hours on Normal usage.So its decent battery I didn liked the volume and power buttons though,they are perfectly fitted.But its not a major concern
 In short,it's an awesome phone for you if you dont have lots f bucks in your pocket

 i have purchased one moto g and gen on 23 rd october 2014 from flipkart and sorry to inform that the screen of the mobile broke on just a simple fall of mobile from my hand while i was sitting in the office.since
 the product is marked by flipkart the company has no service centre of its own and authorized centres are asking for time and charges which are really mind boggling.they
 are saying minimum 25 days to 30 days will be required and charge of Os 6727/- for replacement.more
 then half the cost of the phone
 had used many other phone and using lucia 1320 right now.they are not so vulnerable if
 this is the strength of the body and quality of service i doubt people will buy moto for second time.anyway
 i have no complain about performance of the mobile.it is very good

 I purchased this phone as part of Fig Million May Offer
 The phone was delivered by with October
 The phone display touch and everything was perfect
 Only issue is the first him card slot which is shown as disabled
 Have tried using him cards of different carriers to check if problem was with the him cards
 The him cards worked in second sloth
 Since its a hardware issue I requested for a replacement
 I got a call from Flipkart service center
 The person gave some troubleshooting steps and said the issue would be resolved
 I thought since I haven updated the result of troubleshooting, the requests status would be In Progress but to my surprise the status was Replacement Rejected Now can the request be rejected when my issue was not resolved
 Thoroughly disappointed by the way Flipkart's Customer Are team candles replacement requests
 Have raised another request in the system
 By 30 day replacement period would end on with and these customer care people have delayed by request till the
 By request should not be rejected again based on some senseless ground

 By first order from flipkart , ordered it from the flipkart mobile pp .
 received the product in just 3 days without any masses or issues
 coming to the phone..it looks amazing and feels great in the hand for a 5 inch phone , its not heavy , the back is not slippery and one handed use is very much possible
 the screen display is very impressive and gives you a feel of a premium phone rather than a entry level phone the touch is pretty neat , the camera is a imp camera and the picture quality is pretty unable , it will not disappoint you the front facing cam delivers only in good lighting conditions
 the sterno speakers are placed nicely in the front and perform very well
 the phone supports dual him
 Now coming to one of the main attractions of this phone STOCK ANDROID !!! Easy to use , lag free no gimmicks , responsive , friendly UI , and priority for future updated is what makes the using experience amazing
 The 2070 may battery perform very well and gives you a days use with moderate to heavy use
 All in all its a pound for pound phone and considering the price range and competitors its the best buy available with a good brand and good build quality and longer lasting phone

 The phone looks quite good but the problem that existed in st Men Moto G still seem to exist
 eg os Shone seem to have problem starting up or charging after getting fully drained
 2)The phone gets very heated up after clinking 10 or more photographs with/without flash
 the charger seems to be of very inferior quality .
 You need to push it from different angles to get it working Its strange that these problem were already discovered in gen 1 and still seem to exist
 Now the easiest thing is the get a return or replacement
 But it would help only if my hands has those problem .
 An anyone else point out if they face similar problems

 Hardware is enough good in this price range used almost for two months main probe are realized ram and software malfunctioning, it removed sd card automatically and unexpectedly similarly it disabled SIM.
 Sometime few andros process stops unexpectedly................................needed that Motorola should give good attention to OS design
 West every thing works fine
 Based on my experience with hands in approve
 Two months and finally flipkart refused me
 Wait for andros L updated hope Motorola will fix these problems or go for HTC desire 816.

 overall it is best phone in the mid range
 but battery back up is less
 Not even half day back up
 video clarity is good
 camera clarity is good
 To USB cable
 And the ear phone music output is good but it doesn fit in ears
 even sonya is providing the same ear phone for buying phone for 27k.
 compared to other phone this is better

 The service is just awful
 By phone developed some problems and had to sent to the service center for repairs
 Even after 15 days the phone is not repaired
 The local service center says the parts are not available and Motorola has not dispatched them
 The call center says the parts have been dispatched 3 days ago
 I tried chatting with Motorola, entailing them calling them up but to no avail
 Motorola has not provided a standby phone also despite repeated requests to do so
 To matter how good the phone - it is a absolute os os for the service provided

 Not this delivered in the stipulated weeks time frame
 Good packing
 Rose - All the positive as per original Android interface
 - Good form factor - Adequate weight as per the size - Very responsive touch-screen - Lovely camera primary and secondary and LED flash - Didn't feel any pitch using 1GB RAM for normal work not included any games - 16GB internal memory - Inclusion of expandable micro os sloth
 - Lovely display resolution Sons - Volume level is not adequate even on headphones took for listening to music or watching moves unless you are quite close to it or listening to it in the dead of a silent night
 - Sometimes misses getting read by Laptop when connected by USB cord works ok when restarted - Since Google Lay Tore has a ton of apply once you download the essentials the battery life is too short at 2070 mAh, needs charging least once each day
 - Should have included a micro USB connection in the box

 The device is good to hold and the looks are cool
 West budget mobile - totally worth it I suggest anyone who wants to buy this phone not worry about negative reviews
 Must buy it and you wont regret
 Only one issue though - by default the ratification led not lit while charging .
 You've to press power button every time to check the charging status - whether the phone charging or not Other than that everything is nice

 Must got the device on th Nov'14.
 Really like the design
 Its sleek and resolution is very good
 However I am having issues with the internet connectivity.
 I was using a Gumma before and the internet speed was really good on that device but now on Moto G the internet speed is very slow and shows an error of connection timed out frequently
 His happens when we are on the play stores
 Another thing which I didn like is that Moto G hasn come with a USB cable
 The phone isn getting overheard and not is the charger for now
 But the phone takes quite a bit of time to charge fully

 > Well to start with the design I would say is the best
 The curved body fits perfectly in the hand...
 The ports are placed in perfect positions and it does really give a great look when held > Next the camera I still wonder if the front one is really mix os It feels like a mix cam os The shots in the front and back are solid but it clearly misses some details in natural daylight os That is one big con with the phone but considering the prices I would say it is the best... > The touchscreen is battery smooth and the response is great
 I haven seen any phone respond so quickly > Speakers : Dual os Really os
 Not that great Yes it is loud but not really clear > Battery standby is not up to the marked
 But if you are a mid range user you could expect it to stand for a full day
 I tried using it continuously in Os and i had to charge after 4 hours
 To battery honestly not good not even close to good Would have been better even in this price range Maybe with the lollypop updated we could expect more > Stock andros experience is great Still waiting for Lollypop updated > The sensory yes they work good
 I installed CPU-Z and found about 10 sensory and I dont know most of its working > RAM could have been better
 But if you are not a heavy user you need not worry Must go for it > The supplied headset could have been better and data cable is missing Price has no effect on the accessories supplied
 To it could have been better os In the whole this phone stands up to the expectations but of course could have been better...
 I would recommend this phone for mid range users
 Of you are a heavy user strictly dont buy this Considering the price and specie I would rate it 4.75 os in stars Of not for the battery I would have rate it 5..

 I had ordered the motor and Men black on th Love 2014 with extra INR 90 charge for one day delivery I got the delivery by th Love 2014, which is quite satisfying
 After charging the mobile for sometime I tried to switch it on it took a long time I thought this is the very first time that why its taking some time
 When I tried to switch it off but every time I pressed the power button it was taking screenshot.
 Some times the power button was working as volume key
 For long pressing of the power button the device was getting restarted in lieu of getting switched off
 Now can flipkart deliver a product which costs 14000 bucks without even minimal checking of basic functionality.
 I mean the power button is screwed up the first and foremost function
 I am going to return this phone

 I did a month research on this phone since its not available in market..so was bit reluctant...but finally I GOT os About Flipkart:- I ordered it on rd Sov late night and got it on th Nov.Afternoon..so pretty good service on their part...package in best possible condition
 About Phone:- U r surely donna fell in love this phone... 1. Screen is 5 inch but it feels very comfortable in hand....Screen is Awesum...and 2. few people out here had complained about phone getting heated...well on the very first day in not feeling the same... 3.Headphones..bit problamatic..but i was pretty aware of the headphones being delivered 4. One thing i noticed...my phone battery dropped to 14% and suddenly my phone showed some computer reporting type mesages...I locked it ...and then it worked absolutely normal
 Hope....It works fine for the times to come... 5. Some people have complained about sound quality and camera...sound is awesum and camera is god not excellent and front is ok ok,,,,, 6. Overall 9.8/10 Eating
 me body pox tell me how to change lock screen wallpaper..... Well I bought this phone for dad...now I m planning to buy one for me as well...but let me test it for a month

 Decided to purchase Moto G instead of Blackberry Z3.

 It is a really good phone in this price range I previously had a Cava Oris 504Q, and although the prices are similar you can really feel the step up when you use the Moto Os
 The display sound quality camera everything is really good
 Of I had to write about some negative then it would be the battery life but I find that its the same case in all smartphones!
 Definitely a phone I would recommends

Mohd Mubin
 I purchased the phone two weeks back overall the phone is fantastic at this price range
 The 2 things i hated most for this device Door camera quality Images are so noisy that even Samsung's 5 up camera is better
 Shone heat up very frequently with even normal use
 Even the burning smell comes out of the 3.5 mm audit jack
 I have placed a replacement lets see if i get a better device or same

 I am writing this review after using the phone for more than a weeks
 Earlier I was using Canvas mobile and I decided to buy this with little bit of hesitation due to negative reviews in web sites
 But I feel I am lucky to choose MotoG2.
 The phone has an awesome cool display resolution and clarity with a os screen
 Touch response is smooth and faaast,, It An run full os video arcade games or multitasking with out any last
 GPS is extremely responsive with in milliseconds when turned on
 Loudspeaker is front facing and can hear the phone ringing even while driving Screen is quite clear and visible in direct sunlight with basic display brightness settings itself
 I am not using any screen guard till now and I can hardly find any scratches in the screen after a weeks use(Thanks for Gorilla morning 3).Camera quality is decent under sufficient light exposure
 Lollipop OS upgrade will roll on soon That more do you expect from a smart phone at this price range..? Must go for it Now coming to the Sons section.(It
 doesn bother me thought Battery back up is not up to the mark Os need to charge twice a day Not rigid like Canvas 4. I feel if it is dropped down surely the display will get cracked

 To doubt the product is better for a user but the quality issues and defects that users are facing are bad
 By friends and me purchased the phone a month ago and we are happy with the performance of device only battery issue that is common for such phone but we are having different kinds of problems in honest
 Even after replacement problems are not solved because new set even having different problems
 Issues are : 1. and person sound doesn come during calls 2. volume key icon comes repeatedly 3. ratification panel doesn works many times 4. Touch response doesn work and many more
 To overall average marks for the phone not up to the mark

 Talking about the headset it is really awesome , but when it comes to service from flipkart they suck
 The headset that was delivered to me has issue with the second him slot and fipkart guns keeps on telling useless things to correct it but in the end they agreed to return it when asked about the replacement they said they dont have the headset but on webster the set was available ideally it should be out of stock as the headset is not available now coming to the return point they have screwed us to such an extent that some how finally I have got my every penny back from them
 I would recommend never buy from flipkart in future Cheers

 Vice performance
 Most useful is that its Not heating at all
 Camera Good
 Gaming performance is also good
 Now about flipkart.
 when i ordered this phone i was eligible for offer of hittel data of go for 2 months
 But after days i didn received any code via mail
 so i contracted them & their reply was u are not eligible for this offer
 and they show me the list which phone are eligible for this offer
 Most shocking i saw in that list was Foka 105 gets this offer
 Now disgusting it is that they are giving hittel internet offer to nikita phone which doesn support any internet facility

 I would write my review in two sections 1. Shone 2. Flipkart buying experience of the phone
 1.
 In Shone 1. Excellent phone 2. Feels like premium smart phone
 3.
 To nonsense UI layer stock andros experience 4. Useful default apes pre-installed.
 By Eating for Moto G and gen : 4/5 2. In Flipkart purchase experience 1.
 With my and bad experience in purchase i can now surely say that quality on the flipkart side is deteriorating.
 2. Faced problems while performing payment
 By account got debated but amount was not received on flipkart side
 there were no errors during payment process
 3. When contracted flipkart support rather correcting on their side support was suggesting me that they will cancel the order and i have to place a new order
 which was not feasible as i had to make another transaction of 12999 .
 and i had to wait for 7-8 days for my earlier payment to get returned
 4. One support member without solving my problem started guiding me to place a new order than addressing the issue
 5. Finally after few days , looks like they corrected the problem and phone was shipped
 6.
 His time flipkart took lot of time to deliver the phone
 By Eating on flipkart : 2/5

 Os a package for the prices its an excellent phone
 Sleek light great configuration etc
 However its just over 10 days I am using it but perplexed about couple of issues already
 1.
 While on call the voice gets feeble often in almost all calls
 I initially thought the person other end isn holding their hands properly however I realized its not the case after clarifying it a couple of times
 Moreover we can see a lot of others raised the same issue took
 2. The voice / music on headset speaker is distorted
 Not expected as the dual front speaker is one of the key USPs of this phone
 3. Started lagging
 Strange considering the pure stock Android OS and great configuration
 The animation / graphics isn smooth as it generally when you get back to the home screen
 It laws for a second and all icons appears together without any animation
 hats for now
 To they have fixture or need to look for replacement
 Hang - Hubbub

 I ordered the phone on with oct but received on th november the delivery services of Flipkart are getting worst day by day,Flipkart team please do not take customers for granted.Now come to the Shone Os have only one word to say "Awesome".The camera is very good even the front cam is very decent.The Shone is easily a winner in the low Budget segment.In Os 15000 you can not get better than this am loving my Phone.The Only drawback is the battery which takes near 3 hours to get fully charged Otherwise the Shone is excellent in all other specification

 I have used this phone for a weeks
 moto g 2 is a good mid range phone
 it is worth buying
 there are some drawback which are as follows the charger and the phone itself becomes very hot while charging
 when we use camera for more time the phone gets hot and starts to hang up
 when we access many applications at a time the phone hangs and the speed decreases
 there is no us cable in the box
 but in my opinion if someone asks me to buy a phone in this range i will refer him to the moto g 2.

 His phone is outstanding in peroformance...it does not lag at all..processor speed is mindblowing..camera is outstanding have no words to describes its sharpness at this price point..front facing cam is very good for selfie..runs every pp smoother as it says..the now factor of this phone is its speakers one word only holly shit..The only drawback is its headphone its of cheap quality it should have being least decent quality..thats it so my review is go for it if u are looking for low budget smartphone having higher specs...

 Moto g and generation is a good mobile with nice build quality and design
 Took and feel of the device is also good
 Camera quality is average.battery

 But when recording video the sound recording quality is very bad
 Overall device is good with this price tag it should be more cheaper

 For the first 20 days I didn faced any problem again I am getting disturbance when I make calls Initially it was very low but now its too much
 I raised a request for replacement again lets see what happens To guns please be careful while purchasing moto go

sushant parab
 After using it for months
 Yes price to performance ratio is important
 but Quality also matters and Moto G 2014 will give you that
 Opens doesn matter at all
 Apple is proving that every second but those are high end phone
 not made for common man
 Of you are a student or on a tight budget
 buy moto g 2014 and you wont regret your choice.oh! Lollipop is on the way :-D Still I gave 4 star not os why
 Dear Camera is not that great
 I mean you are getting what you paid for and maybe more but dont compare to other imp SmartPhones.
 also color dont feel realistic and processor is old but again speck are not that important
 Verdict West in this Budget below 20k!!!!) To for it

 I have purchased my moto and gen on September 12 and its nearly 2 months that I have used the phone
 Its a nice phone from Motorola at such a decent prize has a cool capered look with adequate features and remarkable performance
 I didn faced any kind of problem all apes and games are running smooth
 Battery back is also good lasts 8 his on moderate usage of music gaming n internet but last 4 only 2 his on excessive g browsing
 Fool to open apes n other do other simple tasks through goose voice recognition
 Both rear n front camera pick have good quality
 In a whole at this price on comparison with other smart phone i found moto go better in all ways...

 Met me put the review in a simple way PROS: 1.Processor is too good,no lag during usual operations,but i have observed lag of only 1-2 seconds while multitasking.
 2.Display is awesome.
 camera quality and features are better than moto g first genu
 4.Easy to access dual him settings
 front speakers are loud n clear
 CONS: 1.Performance of the Battery is one of the major problems of this phone,it takes 3.5 hours to get charged from 14% to 90%.Also for opium use the discharge period is 7.5-8 hours.But if you use phone for high end games,continues g network and carrot multitasking,the battery life reduces to 5.5-6 hours 2.In box accessories are pathetic.The ear phone are not of good quality and charger is also not impressive
 3.Battery heat up severely
 VERDICT:MOTO G and GEN is awesome phone with very few drawbacks.A more than worth buy for its price.But it is definitely not a phone for game gigs,unless you can carry a power bank

Siddhant Saxena
 i ve got this one on 14 of Sov so this is a well examined review
 first impression was awestruck.
 i ordered a black one and it is beautiful .
 i love it most because of it unique look when screen is locked its pure black .
 Build quality built quality is nowhere compromised .
 it feels rich and comfortable on handing and it is surprisingly unable with single hand despite of 5 inch
 it is too handy and fun to use Features - i will not brag about the obvious features that you can find anywhere on net but what i liked most about this phone it it supports any game you can think of and it runs too well
 if u are a gaming kind of person it is for you
 ratification light is beautiful
 no seriously it is too pleasing
 Being a Google phone its like iting on cake
 voice command and assist are the features for real use lot just for name
 Battery backup- i seriously want to highlight it BATTERY BACKUP os NOWHERE LESS.
 i ve been using it for a long lime and i have no complaints it gives a back up of 8-10 his on nominal use and continuous iii usage which is not at all bad for a 5 inch screen phone
 but the only probe is when you are playing high end games u can see a drop of 10-15% battery in 15 mins.so
 get POWER BANK in that cases
 Performance overall performance of this device is 4 at the scale of 5. cost Heating problem - this device gets heated up very soon
 while gaming and also while using some heavy application it gets significantly heated up
 sound output - it is amazing during calls very clear and crisp but if you are willing to listen music at loud speaker it will be a disappointment
 sound in feeble and also poor in quality
 Also you will have to buy a new headset because stock headset are just os nothing more than that
 sound output is very low
 HATS OFF os FLIP KART by this purchase lip part seriously won my heart .
 i bought 2 sets out of which one was getting too much heated up
 i just called up and complained
 second day i got a call back and with due Curtsy they asked me to hard rest the phone i did it and reported back that problem is not solved
 i received a call and without any request and obligation they just told me that i ll get a new phone with in 3 days and it will be an hand to hand replacement
 i mean seriously it so simple os i bet you will not get this kind of service at any store and at any cost
 just go for it guns its i the best deal you can get under ask

krishna lingam
 Buds for the fast delivery delivered exactly in a day Coming to phone its fast and responsive my shone os But the The 5 inch display is good for watching moves but its hard to read puff
 text isn sharp as expected
 The worst part is the charger its slow charge
 It takes the to charge this phone
 It is 500mah charger while most charges are rate at 1000mah-2000mah.
 People buying this phone consider to buy a charger with 1am-1.5am
 or if you own a microusb charger then use that
 These are my initial impressions about the phone
 I will write another review soon

 within 10 days of purchase .
 noticed battery problems
 need to charge twice or thrice daily os reported this problem to Flipkart and requested for return... got only 1 call from their technical team to rest the phone
 done .... no improvement os even so called flipkart didn called back to check if my problem is solved or not os even no response to return also... i would suggest not to go ahead with this brand and of course with Flipkart.. and its mandate that i need to put some star mark during giving my review... where as i do want want to rate this even single star.... its not worth

Pranay Jha, Ja...
 Honestly,I didn read the reviews before ordering for the phone.The brand name of Motorolla and the specification as well as the trust of flipkart repelled men one hand phone is enchanting package of buttersmooth processor excellent camera output,audio quality,sleak design ,userfriendly operation etc.But the device is a drag on battery which drains so fast even after moderate use after full charge.Takes very long time for full charge say roughly two hours.There is poor network after twitching the same sets of him from my old phone.Post experience,when I read the reviews found that the battery letdown is felt by most buyer and network issue also by many
 Could,it be possible with the joint effort of Motorrola and flipkart that they join the bandwagon of big automobile names to recall sets and fix the common problem faced by many

 1. Flipkart delivery one day before committed date
 2. Handset looks good with white back cover 3. Moto G had a small (6-8") Data Cable but and Men has none guess its cost cutting measure 4. I had earlier bought a Moto G for 11,999 which had two major manufacturing defects (1) sound quality when speaking to anyone including Flipkart; and (2) battery began to show bulges within a week of delivery
 Flipkart took it back and sent to manufacturers and created my wallet arc with 11,999.
 After heating for a month whether to or not to I made up my mind added 1,000 to the kitty and ordered for Moto G and Men for 12,999 say 13,000 those 999s are deceptive His time as I opened the back cover to put in SIM cards I noticed the battery isn any more visible
 Result user canst keep a watch if the battery is drying up too soon to be acceptable
 Motorola too has learned from experience of earlier model what to reveal and what not to
 5.
 I shall use the mobile and add further feedback if I have any
 Will then good by my friends

 PROs: Everything is the best you can get in this price range from Display,sound,touch,Camera,performance,memory to build,look,buttons etc CONS: Front sterno speakers really not that loud
 Though far better than MOTO g st genu
 Battery performance is Average
 Bags on heavy games even clashes sometimes
 Had Multi-tasking, games & apes start while opening back from recent apes menu

 I evolved from Micromax A110 Canvas os to the New Moto G agent It is worth a Shone
 teres my review after I bought it Pros.... os To Bags - Very User primarily looks at this thing first simply no last even after forcing my phone to show me some it failed showing any..... That else do you need os os Shone is Bandy - Its in my palm so no need to use both hands and doesn fall on my face when using it lying down on my bed Os os Right weight - Os compared to my A110 its Light.... enough said os Unable - I actually dropped my phone the other day from a height of 4 feet and had a mind Heart Attack but lucky me its still working no scratch nothing Os remembered those days when i used to fling my Foka phone around without worrying about a single thing...... os Learning dont try this stung you will end up looking all that you paid for os Probably I think I was the first one to get an update as no one mentioned about it at that time with Sep'14 to be precise Os as soon as i unvexed the phone and connected it to my iii I had an update waiting so expecting Lollipop sooner than other folks Os os Round - OMG the sound is awesome, Dual speakers blow the sound like a sterno set that is if you have the right media os To Heating - Unlike other I didn notice any heating during calls it only gets heated if Am under the sun for a long time with my Shone exposed to it ... Its a Black Shone and Black absorb Death so no complaints os 12.9GB free internal storage - Yes all the apes you want to fill in your phone Currently I have 94 excluding the pre-installed, so this is enough to prove the phone does lag os To Software - Surely stock android, that means no unwanted apes pre-installed which you wont be using 10) Looks Rich - Yes It does look elegant 11) James - Works smooth FIFA 14, FIFA 15, Real Facing os temple Run works smooth except for subways surf it laws a bit again no complaints co my His is a crazy fan of Subways and she noticed laws in almost every phone she played on so no complaints Cons... os charge time 3 his - Hats not good co in a impatient man os Camera - Camera is a bit grain in the indoors but is excellent in the Outdoors.. os Ringtone - ascending ringtone wastes 3 second of ring time os only ~300mb ram free (Doesnt make a difference to me if there is no laws and no force close Its only for the Am hungry guns out there ) hunting for more !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and yes awaiting Android Lollipop..................

 Everything is fine with this phone except the build quality of the display glass
 It fell from a height of 2 feet and the glass was smashed
 Similar thing happened with a colleague of mine who did not even drop his phone
 The worst thing is that the motorola service centre in chennai is so bad that firstly they dont even pick your calls so you have to visit them personally just to find out that the replacement costs around Os 6000 which is half the cost of the phone
 Phone's performance itself is good but if you are even a little bit of rough user do not buy this phone

Ganesh Chalama...
 Not the phone and used for a months
 Were is my review on the gadget.
 Rose - Memory expandable feature with micro os sloth
 - Speakers output on front side
 - Camera 8 os rear and 2 os front
 - Updated Android v4.4.4 (KitKat) OS. - Screen size inch os Screen
 Sons - Screen Resolution Display Appearance is not so good as st Men Moto Os - ICON size is big which looks odd
 no option to reduced
 - There is no 2-in-1 Charger cum Data cable
 - To LED indication when device is charge
 - Door Back
 Verdict Os I mentioned worth for your penny with upgrade features and missed out the disability of the device when compared to st Men Moto Os
 Of your are looking for a best MANGO in this price range just go for this

 Moto G and Men is the King of Budget Smartphones, its hard to find a branded phone with a pleasing 720p IPS display expandable storage good voice quality and a Snapdragon 400 processor for less than 15K.
 It may be inexpensive, but it doesn look cheap
 NFS - Most Wanted Vice City runs smoothly without any last
 Minor drawback Battery Life is good but not great then it requires too much time for charging
 Final waiting for Andriod L updated

Prathap Pruthviraj
 Thanks to flipkart good delivery
 Coming to phone everything is awesome ...
 And the pp very good
 Camera,processor, build quality
 Everything is perfect I facing one problem that is when playing music with high volume on that time anyone call then speaker and mid does not works until restarted
 But I face this problem on second day only
 Further its working good no problem anything like that Battery life is very good as for average use gives 15-18h and continuous use gives 4.30-5h.
 The charger is very bad comes in box it charges phone 3.30-4h (0-100%) so I using Samsung Galaxy core charger(5v,1A) which charges just 2.20h (0-100%).
 To problem with whigs ram I installed 32 average apes no laws to be found.working
 very fine Shone is really water repellent I tested my phone 3 times dont worry about water slash
 And never facing any heating problem even when play games camera video playing charging with Samsung charger with moto charger it will heat up to 45°c).
 But it commonly heat up to 39°-40°c in my phone Great things • os slow motion video • 16 os internal memory • 8 up camera imp font can • os screen resolution • quick charge with same charger • water resistance & gorilla glass • os card support • sterno speakers • good process even its 1 os ram West phone ever just close eyes
 and buy

 His device is absolutely worth it !!! Plus the delivery time was really quick considering I ordered one during Diwali.
 The only downside was that the headphones(or earphones) that come along with the hands are not really that great so if you really like to hear your music get a different set
 The comb offers on flipkart for the same are decent ; feel free to check them out

 Overall nice phone
 But you know if there are pro then there are sons took
 its been almost two weeks since i purchased it through flipkart.
 Its going nice and easy as till now not much apes or files loaded into it
 Eager to know how it would behave under heavy load conditions
 One biggest con is that there is no USB cable provided with the products
 Camera quality is good but it doesn room more than 4X.
 To video booming also
 Vice latest OS andros 4.4.4
 kitkat, upgradable to Coming Android5 lollipop.
 But processor is 1.2ghz only
 RAM is also only 1 os will face difficulty under heavy load conditions must have least 1.5 or 2 os .
 Two sterno speakers are given on top and bottom plays nice sound without earphones, But with earphones sound quality is so low ,It's almost unbearable with earphones.
 Vice sex look overall
 I will rate it 3 and half as below there is option of rating it only either 3 or os but i rate it according to overall performance till now
 Quality is worth according to its price again i would say still now :-)

 I All Now it is my turn to write a review
 After reading lots of good reviews I have decided to buy this products
 I ordered(OD100945372712260100) and with exceptional flipkart service I received it on th of Act 2014.
 I switched on ...but to my surprised nothing appeared on screen instead there was burning secession on my fingers
 I tried multiple time but failed to switch on the device
 Initially burning smell was coming out but stopped after few minutes
 Unfortunately this time the device was not switched on
 I requested for return to flipkart Return ID: 9582841).
 Flipkart replaced the product and I got another new set which was switched on successfully
 I configured you-tube and starts playing video
 After 15-20 minutes I observed that it was started heating up to an extend such that I can not put it on my ears
 I turned off wifi/3g data location service etc and execute same you-tube tests
 West fails
 It was heating up
 I have requested another return Return ID: 8364911 Finally I have received my final hands and I am very happy with this products
 There is no heating issue at all 4 star for overall experience 1 star is deduced for multiple return request

 1. India is country of Music lovers Moto gave FM, Music player including good pair of speakers but os dont have option to enable loudspeakers 2. Lip cover and back covers and good colored and attractive but those are very expensive if I compare the actual price of a device 3. West performance is average to good I can say 4. Battery is again good for fair usage 5. camera has some issues getting blur images when no sunlight but I am still happy with it as I am not camera freak over all I can see os rating out of 5. and its good to have kind of phone if your budget is ask

 Moto Os is a masterpiece by Motor
 Vice Design Brilliant Display and above all fast processing which makes this device unbearable
 The only thing I found is Moto Should have speed for 2500/3000 may battery for this
 Last but not the least Oats off to Flipkart's delivery services...

 Such a nice experience with moto go Moto G and Men is absolutely value for money
 People have the perception that this is a low performance device just because it is low cost
 For me Moto G is simply is as good as any other high-end phone which costs double or more
 wont mind the extra weight and thickness the build quality is definitely superior than any of the Samsung honest

 I dont know if others are facing this issue with Moto go I am seeing that after usage of around 10 to 15 ants screen is becoming insensitive to touch
 To tax is working
 I need keep on pressing the same tax for more than 10 times
 Even to stop a song also I need to press the stop tax around 10 times
 I didn see this issue with other phone I used
 I have not download any apes yet to blame the memory shortage

 I was very confused to spend more than 18 K for my smart phone
 I compared Azus,MI, MOTO G and Gen,Samsung Grand 2 etc which are all similar configurations.Samsung Grand 2 has a if look but 5 K more.MOTO G and Men is very good Not bulky as u imagine looking at the image
 His has a elegant look and strong compared to Us , os and all similar category phones.Some phone say 13 Megapixel camera and all but pick quality may not be good
 For a layman Round quality Speaker quality,camera , speed is important The can buy this blindly.No regret .

 i purchased moto g and gen , 2 weeks ago os everything is awesome except battery back up os i need to charge it for two and half he and it hardly gives me 70% of the day with normal use age and if i use constantly with some calls games and testing it not even gives me half a day ... and coming to camera while taking pick is good and view is also good when i room a little it piles and also when i son them to my pp even can easily fined out pick is violating ....... and also it becomes over heat when i use camera or play games more than 5 mints i dont know whether i am the one facing this problem or every one ...

 I was very happy to buy MOTO G 2. The phone has a rich finish
 Very good speakers mindblowing camera
 But the problem with this hands is the aftersales service which I would like to state is below average
 body in the company seems o have a knowledge about this handset.
 The company boats that the hands is customisable but it is not so
 The lip covers you are getting for such a hands is not good and very Expensive took
 To for the first time buyers its an awesome phone... and lastly the phone is very good in its range and from a good brand took

 have been using the Moto G and Men for exactly a month now and I love it
 Considering my pretty high usage of WhatsApp and Facebook, battery still lasts for an entire day and not phone doesn heat up or anything when charging
 Camera quality is pretty decent memory is good took
 Must had one problem with phone hanging / freezing in a weeks time but that was because of an pp I had downloaded, delete the pp phone back to being awesome since that
 processor maybe)...
 To USB cable in the box using my old phone cable and not its not like one of those charges where USB and charger are same connected there deaf no USB cable and I have checked the box thoroughly
 In the box headset is also pretty bad doesn fit is ancient style deaf not cool and hurts my ears
 him using another headset with the phone so big flop on accessories!
 Also had to buy the Moto lip case separately its an awesome case to go with this phone but could have been cheaper I get great compliments on the case and the phone both
 To sum it up if you want all the features that this phone has on a universally known and good brandy you deaf need to pay around 5-10k more than this
 To just because of the disappointing accessories, I give it a os else would have been 5 stars with 2 thumbs up

Ananth Pedapudi
 him only going to talk about their delivery because the phone was just as described
 I live pretty much at the center of Hyderabad - near Ameerpet - which is why I think this review is important
 Flipkart does not deal with the local courier services anymore
 He as Indians know how these couriers can be erratic and unorganized
 But E-kart is a whole new things
 Apparently it is somehow associated with Flipkart - as the driver explains it - and the delivered are made from a moving truck
 His is how it broke down for me
 The truck driver calls me 2 hours before hand
 He calls me again 30 mind before the delivery
 Since I have some business to tend to I tell him and rather pick it up
 He tells me exactly where he is the is delivering at some other address and asks me to come there
 I show up exactly 10 mind later
 I pay the money and he has a bill printer with him with which he instantly gives me the bill - just like in a regular retail stores
 And I have a brand new Moto Os P.S. - The phone is awesome.

 Ought it on the launch day and received on time
 Buds to Flipkart!
 Haven't had any challenge as such except on the navigation while accepting settings which I presume co of kitkat.
 By Micromax canvas a111 with 4.1 is much better than Moto G and Men Navigation
 However this can be resolved by downloading apes like cleanmaster with its ratification toggle.
 Launch day offer want that impressive except Mytra.com's
 35% discount
 Of you want to avail 1GB Same with good internal memory then this would be surely a great choice

 I placed an order for motor on must oct,2014 and it got delivered on th nov,2014 fine with the speed at which flipkart delivers the goods
 But i am totally disappointed the performance of the piece when it is compared with samson galaxy start
 both devices are connected to wife winged and turned on mobile network alternatively to access internet no problem with other device but moto moto is not showing any promise.....pals could any one suggest what to do...shall i claim my money back by sending the piece back to flipkart..? you know on either side of the front panel there are scratches as well is it st hand piece or ?
 I am convinced to write this bc the problem i shared with flipkart team has got responded and got processes the replacement of earlier dispatched old one with new piece on with November
 The first motor took nearly os hours to charge fully and briskly getting discharged for about 8 hours of normal usage with out internet but new one lasts for longer time,internet access is good on new device.exclusive
 moto apes make the piece bit unique
 It would be good if there are no such dispatching of stale ones either by accidentally or deliberately

 Fellow I buyer it 1 week before for the past 7 days I felt awesome about the phone performance its having brilliant display and speakers are good internet usage is awesome pages will load so quickly but the phone is heating around the rear camera it always heat I dont know why and in multitasking if you jumps from game and if you return to it the game will restarted this is kind of ugly Using g in this mobile is not good for 10 minutes usage your phone will get heat a lot around the rear camera

 You have already read pro and sons by many reviews os as a game i used this mobile to play os games like shalt 8 and if 15 etc mobile runs them very smooth

Dhaval Mistry
 His was my first online purchase so I was worried about the quality of products
 But Flipkart gives its best when it comes to quality Now the main point The phone is absolutely amazing with blazing processor speed never laws while playing games or multitasking.Internet speed is pretty good.Good GUI.
 MOTO G SECOND GEN is full of awesomeness Damages captured with camera are good in quality front cam though 2 os is pretty decent
 Flag free performance
 Great for multitasking.
 >Stereo speakers are also very good
 All quality is also fine
 >Android L is coming to this phone
 Lastly the battery life is average but then it again depends upon use
 People looking for new phone must definitely go for it

 Build quality of the phone is fantastic
 Superb sound from the front dual speakers
 Camera-Motorola has really worked on the camera.the
 picture clarity has improved by a huge margin.the
 imp camera is way better than the imp camera of the Moto even the front camera is now better.So full marks to Motorola for improving the camera
 Screen Quality-its a 5 inch 720 IPS LCD screen and as usual the quality of the display panel is very good,viewing angles are good too.color
 reproduction is also very natural and not over saturated
 Stock Android experience-The phone is running the latest version of Android.i.e.4.4.4.Kitkat.apart
 from the 2-3 Motorola apps,there is no bloatware.that's
 the main reason Motorola did not bump up the processor and the mammas the hardware can easily work,multi taking is also smooth on the phone.no
 last
 gaming experience is also fun now because of the front dual speakers
 Micro os expansion unto 32gb another feather added in the cap
 cost Motorola could have bumped up the battery capacity unto 2300mah.
 The phone could be a bit more sleek
 Overall i would say this phone is here to stay inspire of the stiff competition

 I always had high regards for Flipkart and their service
 But this transaction shattered all my beliefs
 When I tried ordering Moto G and gen on Act the the payment was debated twice
 I was not gathered too much because it had happened earlier too and normally the amount would be created back in a couple of days or maximum one weeks
 Even after a week passed when I didn get my money back I wrote an email to the customer service and have been following up with them till date
 Today when I called the Customer care I was informed that only one order was canalised and the other order for which the second payment was debated was only initiated
 Os I didn refer the other order number my complaint has been kept pending for such a long time
 I canst understand how I am supposed to quote an order number which I dont know
 Now it is almost a month and the customer care guy coolly responds that it will be refused by November 11th.
 Os I have got no other go but to pay the credit card bill and wait patiently for these people to refund my amount
 I never expected such poor service from Flipkart and mostly this would be my last transaction with Flipkart.

 I dont feel the need to write about the various cross that this phone has as other members have already written about them
 However as has been rightly pointed out by many the battery life is pathetic
 Hence for that purpose I have been experimenting about various steps that one can take to ensure satisfactory battery backup.
 Three things that worked for me 1. Turn off Os mode and use 2G, if you are not a Os user
 2. Turn off Vocation
 Os saw this as a major contributory to battery life
 3. Turn off Google Now
 Or for that matter turn off "Google Now notifications" only if you want to use "OK GOOGLE" features
 These three turn off have made my life easier
 And my battery life increased twofold
 Thumbs up if you find this useful and let everybody see it
 Good Luck

 I was a fan of Motorola, been using Moto Defy XT535 and Moto War Road since the time Motorola has come into the smartphone world I recently purchased Moto Os one for my days elder brother and one for my dad after getting to know its just an evolutionary upgrade from G to Os with minor hardware and software changes
 I had seen Moto G st gen got to know its performance through friends and decided to take the and gen for my dad too bad the battery drains so fast even when days when absolutely no calls were made and no data transfer i mean when iii and Mobile data were used occasionally
 The battery is a big disappointment according to me
 Although it has promised for the Lollipop upgrade must wait and see if it can help the battery back on this device
 A big zero for the battery for a tier brand like Moto to come up with this big disappointment in Moto G and Men

 Order os (OD300944800440674700) Replaced the hands for Speaker problems while speaking speaker give noisy sound in the background
 Replaced hands also had the same problem.... and finally asked for the refund
 seems that Motorola launched the phone in a hurry without proper testing of the products
 Moreover Flipkart did not provide the picked of the phone i had to courier it to them
 Expenses incurred will be reimbursed in to the user wallet forcing me to make future purchases from Flipkart in order to get back the courier expenses incurred

 I have recently purchased this phone and found good prima facies
 Os soon as i started using this found two major issues viz Battery back up and os card sloth
 And the major issue is with the flipkart services
 I received this product right with day from the date of purchase in Ahmedabad town
 I will assign only 0 marks for the delivery services
 Furthermore When tried to convey my grievance regarding the defects of this product to flipkart executive he simply put phone on hold every time
 The battery back is not good as it does not last more than 10 his
 The os card slot is not working
 I do not understand why flipkart is doing such nonsense by disputing such irresponsible executive and selling defective products

 Moto g and generation is an average smartphone,but flipkart has made it look very bad by delivering defective products every time replaced my device twice but both the times i got a defective piece.Motorola has done a bad job by selecting only flipkart as their seller.There are other e commerce sites which are very good than this flipkart.
 Coming to the phone,it has many issues.The battery is very weak,The ear piece produces a cracking sound during calls,The mobile and the charger heat a lot,The mobile takes nearly 4 his to charge,The volume and power buttons are very loose,The ear phone provided is a piece of crap,The touch is not responsive,we can feel the issue with touch screen when we are tying a message(you can test the touch screen issue by keeping your mobile on a flat surface and then type some letters or numbers and try meeting them one by newby continuously pressing the delete key
 The available 400 mb ram falls short during multi tasking,Thinking about motorola service centers is a nightmare
 The only good about this phone is that its going to get andros nothing other than that
 I dont know whether it was my bad luck to get defective pieces thrice,or was motorola responsible to ship defective pieces or is flipkart selling us defective and rejected honest
 To think before you buy
 And one more thing,The mobile comes in different variant some have a good screening some the screen is worst,with pink or reddish tint all over it have unloaded the images regarding display quality in moto go forum,you can check it

 I had ordered the product on with October & due to Diwali holidays flipkart gave with October as the expected date of delivery which is acceptable
 They had shipped the product by com repaid But it is th November today & I still have not received my order
 I must have contracted the flipkart customer care around a dozen times & they lack commitment as well as into regarding the order placed
 They are giving commitment of dates which have already passed
 I also tried to get in touch with the com Repaid guns but no one answers the damn phone
 Now they have canceled the shipment & are re-shipping the products
 Hope it reaches me on time
 It was meant to be a birthday gift for someone & now here I am having nothing to give as a present on the day because of flipkart & com Repaid
 I am just sharing my experience with flipkart & com repaid so that you can be aware about it before ordering your MOTO Os Please note that I have a similar make & model already purchased from flipkart a month back & the phone is value for money but the site your buying it from lacks the ability to value its customers

 Excellent...i was little sceptic when i had placed the order for it and did not get the delivery.Somehow i placed the order again after Diwali..and i am totally satisfied by the cadet that i recieved.Its really good.Using Moto-brand for the first time..No doubt Moto-G is quite smart in looks and features
 Very thing was intact as displayed on flipkart but i wish data-cable could have made this package absolutely complete.(Data
 cable should also be provided

 Before I start to review it I wants to say something about Flipkart's delivery service
 It was a horrible and nightmarish experience To a suggestion if you are paying 13K, you can certainly pay another Os 90 for a "in-a-day" delivery if its available in your pincode).
 To for the fast delivery
 wont choose free delivery its horrible and terrifying
 Now I come to the Review of MOTO G and Gen).
 I got this phone on must october 2014 morning
 him using this device for 4 days now so got a decent idea about this phone
 >>PROS: 1. GORILLA GLASS 3 Protection
 Even Grand 2 dont have this
 2. Later Resistance coating you can use this phone even in rain
 I tested water its superb Later resistant
 3. Android 4.4.4 with guaranteed update to Android Os His means you'll have latest android.
 4. Excellent os screen with superb brightness you can do your work even in sunlight
 Must turn the Auto Brightness And 5. Dual Sterno front speakers are decent
 6. Camera quality is EXCELLENT.
 I mean it
 Superb and fine Pictures are taken from Moto os default Camera Pp
 Even you can increase its performance via downloading some awesome camera pp from Lay Stores
 7. Graphics quality and GPU works very fine
 Pretty decent experience with gaming and heavy os gazing
 8. 1GB RAM is good enough for your work
 9. 16 os Internal storage with 12.3GB of Free space
 That is brilliant
 10.
 I really haven tested iii yet so canst tell anything about it
 11.
 Sure Android experience is a big plus
 12. Build quality of Moto G is one of the finest you'll find
 13.
 Customer care of Motorola is surprisingly awesome.
 Their Must
 service website's have That system is Superb
 You can solve any of or problem instantly there
 its a Fig Fig Help for your any Motorola smartphones.
 14.
 Well It covers almost all of my needs and hopefully yours also if you have a budget of under 20K.
 Trust me I did a long and detailed research about smartphones of Under 20K range and this is an excellent device to buy >>> CONS:: 1. Badly like EVERY other phone it has some disadvantages as well st of all id BATTERY.
 Moto G and Men has a battery of 2070 mAh.
 Battery drains out pretty fast while you use data connection little bit
 while downloading if you play games still be drains out battery extremely fast
 its very Hard to keep the phone on in a single full charge for 24 Course
 Its Impossible really
 Tax battery can last 16-18 hours with very moderate use
 Of you use more than that you have to charge least for a hour to keep it on
 To twice charging in a day is must even in a brand new phone
 But Charging to 100% dont take too long
 Even you can charge it fast by buying a powerful power bank or anything like that
 2. Quality of headphone is very poor
 I suggest buy a good headset to have a excellent music experience
 3. Moto G and Men DON"T HAVE a USB data cable to connect it with PC.
 To you have to buy it again
 its really sad 4. Deep the brightness to very low to save battery
 Unless its cost too much battery which you canst afford
 But With this low brightness you can do everything superbly.
 Now as you can see Moto G has almost everything to fulfill your demand but it lacks a strong battery power
 But Of you use it smartly and there are several apes in play store to save battery life which are quite useful still last enough long to serve you
 and To for official Moto G Shells from Flipkart, yes its costly but It add a brilliant looks and superb grip to the phone
 To I strongly suggests Use original Moto G shells its very very good
 Final words Thumbs Up
 You can go for it

 the mobile looking was nice rear and front camera was good quality , charger was more heat during the charge the mobile please care while charging , i request the dear to solve the problem and make the mobile good the net access was not much speed , the action was little bit one the internal memory was 12.975GB only instead of 16GB, remaining was internal applications
 the built applications were not enough in smart phone and battery was not long lasting using limited applications also , please improve the battery back life

 I purchased this phone on 4-5th day after launch... i have used phone of other major bands took like samsung, micromax, sony,.. but i found this as best fit phone in my budget... ism surprised to see some people commenting negative about phone but till now i do not have any issue with this phone and it works excellent... all highly recommend this phone to people...
 His phone have much better build quality and speed as compared to any of the samson phone unto ask price range... this phone have great specification and features which ism going to mention below... Display Processor and OS The New Moto G and genu arrives with a inch IPS multi-touch display that provides sharp visual experience with a resolution of 720 x 1,280 pipes (HD).
 The Morning Gorilla Glass 3 protected touch responsive display enables you to make transitions between screens edit photos or access apes at the expense of crisp touches
 It the heart of the smartphone, you can find the same 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor sanctioning in combination with 1GB of RAM to deliver fearless and fast performance with anything you throw at it
 It comes reloaded with the stock version of the recently launched Android v4.4.2 KitKat OS.
 Also in few days probably in mid of novo
 14 this phone will get andros L... Camera and Storage The New Moto G and genu is armed with an excellent 8MP snapped at the rear end which is far better than the 5MP camera available in the outdoing model Moto Os
 It comes with an LED flash and accompanied by a 2MP shorter above the display
 The on board storage capacity of the smartphone is 16GB, which is further expandable by 32GB using a micro os cards
 Shone supports OTG also for accepting pendrives and other storage devices
 And works excellent...(u can get a OTG from any phone shop at 50-60 bucks Battery and Connectivity The New Moto G is furnished with the regular conductivity features like 3G, dual SIM shots Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and USB ports
 For running the show for a decent amount of time the smartphone relief on a 2,070mAh lesion battery which runs phone approximately for whole day
 About 19-20hrs of battery back on 2g..
 I used to charge it during night and use it whole day
 Sons
 Charger is poor takes too much to charge phone... Approx 4 his from os to 100%.. Internet surging is quite decent and smooth
 Shone supports both micro simon
 Build quality Excellent build quality and really looks great on hands
 Back is mat finish with finger print resistance and front part have gorilla glass 3 which is amazingly hard to withstand almost every harsh condition
 Shone is splash resistant and repel water coming over it
 Great phone at this price range... To for it... Have a good day

 Firstly I was resistant to go for buying Moto Os reading some of the reviews
 Later one of my friend bought him
 I checked it out and the same day I ordered one
 os Super delivery...... just 2.5 days to soon to early
 os 8 os is 8 MP... not like others promising 8 up and clarity is not even 5MP os Battery.. 5 star to the battery
 but The charger heat up
 Same issue certains with moto g and E os Processor is awesome.
 Android 4.4.4
 Locks
 no issues with the ram
 I even played if 14 in it
 os Speakers are loud and clear
 os Touch is awesome and royal
 Thus I conclude that Moto Os is a superb pick keeping in mind that u are upbraiding your self idea after using a low budget cell around 6 - sky
 Wont recommend this phone to all those who were earlier using cells and 25-30k.
 they will never like it
 West cell at its prices

 In Firstly I will start with its positive points • West Android phone at this price only on Flipkart.
 • West Delivery before its delivery time and excellent packaging.
 Now lets start some of its negative points • The rear camera glass is having spots and minor scratches
 • The Camera stopped responding 3-4 times in a day
 When I have to start the phone
 • Camera Auto Focus feature hang the phone due to which phone need to be restarted • Unable to apply Google Drive 50GB offer
 • After that Flipkart arranged the Replacement
 But after replacement I found another issue in new one and that was • SIM 2 Clot is having some internal defects Of I want to insert micro SIM into slot number 2 then the SIM lock mechanism will not hold the micro SIM until I try to insert it again and again for 15 – 20 times
 The same SIM is getting insert only in one time into slot number 1.
 Even tried to replace the micro SIM but the problem with SIM slot number 2 is same
 Note - Flipkart provided the best support to resolve all problems but these are the manufacturing defects
 Flipkart delivered the manufacture sealed product both times so how can anybody know about these issue before using the products
 Motorola must ensure the quality of their products than the sale quantity and Flipkart must escapade these issues to Motorola quality check team

 The Features of this Shone is good overall but it lacks in certain points 1-Camera-The Camera works well in dark light as well so that good.But it could have been a notch better.Also the camera is not that compatible with Pp like Whatsapp.It gets stuck and not easy to send images then
 2-Battery-The battery gets drained very fast and passing even a day without charge becomes tough
 3-Sound-The Round effect with Speakers is good overall.But the Voice clarity needs to be even more polished
 Overall the Shone just about meets expectations but could have been better

 The phone works without laws with the superb processor it has
 Speaking about the display having pp (294) the display is also woodland
 plays os video with ease
 The camera takes clear images with its imp camera only
 i didn like the pre-installed camera pp
 later i download Google Camera pp from play store which is better than the pp that comes with the phone .
 The front speakers are loud and clear .
 Battery-the major drawback with this phone with Os surging you could go for about 6-8 hours while playing games for about half an hour the device heat up too much .
 The wall charging unit provided by Moto is heating like anything
 Conclusion happy with overall performance only drawback is its battery and heating .

 The phone is value for money
 Amazing speed camera and other features
 A few things that needs to be changed in the product are - Headphones are not of good quality as compared to the ones which come with Samsung honest
 - Quality of sound not so good with the headphones given along with the products the same perform good with other ones
 - Did not like the built os Pp
 Overall good products value for money
 Flipkart delivery was pathetic and it was delayed by 9 days

 I bought this phone for my dad
 Its a wonderful phone , i guess the best at this price right now
 The andros OS is also kind of similar the plain vanilla one on Nexus , hence its smooth and responsive
 And transferring the contact from my days old Foka 2960 to the phone was a breeze with the built in Motorola transfer pp
 And i placed the order at 8PM one night and Flipkart delivered it to me the next day afternoon what more can u ask for
 Overall we are extremely satisfied with the purchase

 Guys, Please do not trust Flipkart service
 All are theaters
 I have ordered Moto G and Men on must Dec 2014 and canceled it as it was with EMI.
 To I have placed the same order again on the same day for without EMI.
 Not the product on with it self
 But the twist is here on rd Sov I have got the canceled product delivered to me where as the request got canceled and the customer care said the product also has been received with in 2 days to them
 I wondered today when I received the products
 It was in the process if giving the money back to me
 I was waiting for a long time for the refund of money as they asked 8 business days
 When I called them today they are telling that they will need 3 more days for pick up the product and another 8 days for processing
 Are they thing I am a fool
 Now Bank is asking me to pay for both the transaction
 Really I got mad because of Flipkart and running behind them on call
 To proper service as well

 Ordered this phone during the Fig Million May sale but when received I realised that its a st Men phone in the box of and Men
 When I registered the complaint with Flipkart on word Oct,14, they assured me that they will get back to me within 3 days
 But they didn and extend the time required after every and day still yet to get the replacement
 Their product specialist was supposed to call me to crosscheck the phone on must Oct,14, but no response yet
 His is really frustration as I have never expected this kind of service from Flipkart..........

 The charger came along with MOTO G and gen is extremely slow it takes almost 4 to 4.5 his to charge the phone completely once i used samsung's galaxy pocket dues charger and it charges the battery from os to 75 % within 45 to 55 mind
 MOtorola should think about it and need to change the charges
 Overall phone is very very good the only problem is it take os his to get charged completely using moto g and g charger

 Whoa !
 That was my first reaction when I took the thing in my hands !
 I have had this for the past 2 weeks and it has in no way disappointed me
 Going by the price this seems to be the best smartphone running andros in the market right now The interface is super smooth and lag free pure andros experience adds to the joy
 Music quality is mind blowing
 The camera is also good image quality far improved from the st gen And 5 " screen is what makes it a joy to look at
 Add to it the sleek looks of the device and you wont regret buying this piece of teach
 And yes I ve owned a lot of smart honest
 His is by far the best

 His is a phone i bought recently
 One of the best phone in this price range and awesome graphics support being supported on the phone
 Motorola has increased the internal memory space and also provided a bigger screen compared to generation one which enables better experience during gazing
 The phone also has a faster GUI which displays the efficiency of the processor inside
 Overall a very good product from Motorola and fast service from Flipkart.

 Faulty Piece - Black Screen I received this piece within 7 days of ordering on the 29 OCTt.
 The first problems crept in within 7-8 hours of receipt
 The display screen first had some random lines and within a few seconds I got a black screen
 After 30-40 minutes I was able to power it on again
 I used it for 15-20 minutes and the same sequence repeated
 His happened around 4 times already
 The most annoying fact is that even a few minutes Quality checks would have identified this problems

 He aware of manufacturing defects First I thank Flipkart for there excellent customer support
 But him not satisfied with the brand Motorola because I replaced my phone two times
 st replacement is for defective top speaker
 and replacement is for not receiving latest update and a damaged pixel.
 Battery 1.
 After a week usage found that average screen time phone usage time is 5 Hours and 30 minutes only which is really terrible
 2. It will take at least 3 Hours and 40 minutes to charge from os to 100%.
 Now I feel like its again a defective piece that I got
 Accessories recommendation 1. Noise Back Over for Moto G and Gen). 2. To not buy cheap Tempered glass because it will affect touch sensitivity
 Design * It feels and looks like a premium phone
 * But when it comes to its physical size Moto G st gen feels compact
 * Feels bit heavier
 Features * Simple and beautiful launched UI which better than Moto G st genu
 * After dating to System version 21.11.23 we will get Ask Google" support
 * It is one of the few phone which will get Android L upgrade
 Performance * Pictures taken with LED flash and artificial lighting are good
 * Front camera laws always
 * After installing clean master with enabled real time protection battery like is os for normal use otherwise it is worst
 But I hope it will be fixed in Android L upgrade
 * It takes his to charge from os to 100% with the given adapted
 * iii conductivity is not so good its almost like that we have to sit in the same room where the iii outer is installed
 * Great GPS and GLONASS connectivity(Good navigation system

 I had purchased Moto Os Men from Flipkart on 06.309.2014.
 It worked ok for 1 month and the problem started then its touch was not working
 Flipkart said 1 month was done and I had to go to Moto service center
 I gave my mobile at service center they repaired and still touch was not working
 I had to give it back to service center
 And I could not also avail offer for lip cover & cases and flipkart did not solve my issue

 Having used moto G st edition and currently using this latest edition I am a true moto loyalists
 The built quality of the phone is superb
 The specification are more than sufficient for a normal user
 Firstly if you use your phone a lot of phone calls and email I would only recommend this phone
 The quality of the phone is very important
 In lacks this big time
 The phone does heat up eventually
 Secondly moto g shape is amazing
 It fits in your hand & pockets easily thanks to its design
 In is straight and usually it does fall out
 In has a much better screen but its not that big a factor
 Rose Brilliant design and built quality
 Very user friendly Amazing after sales service Output on headphones is superb
 Doesn't hang/lag at all Irrespective of ram size Made for business use Sons Camera is strictly os Not great for experimentation like if you are a developer
 USB cable is not included
 To ahead and buy it
 U wont regret

 First of all a word for Flipkart's delivery:"Poor" and believe me poor is a kind word in my scenario
 It took them 12 days to deliver from bangalore to bangalore.
 Now coming to device Os am posting this review after using for 2 weeks
 Looks of Device is Good,Though i didn like those front facing speakers look wise,they look better in previous version.Display is bright enough and touch is crisp
 Rose Good Performance Recent Camera Display Quality Good Sons Battery Life is not good(giving me 12-14 hours on average uses on Os network I didn like look of front Speakers Looks cheap to me though its my personal opinion

 Review on 12999 Spent - Built Quality A strong body with fine edges and a sex curved like you are holding a beautiful girl in your hand
 Screen Right and colourful with awesome viewing angles and a screen to fall in love with
 Round His what I loved the most two front facing speakers - Loud & Crisp quality
 Camera A necessary upgrade from last years Moto Os now with 8MP and a quality to be cherished and a breathtaking Low motion video capturing
 Front also serves a decent quality
 Battery Though the same size battery should be a drawback but it serves more than what one can think
 It last for more than 30 hours
 To sum up It is Magical to hold a Moto Os as it is Sexy, beautiful and bold
 Proud owner of a MOTO.

 Hello All I have purchased this mobile on big billion day and after a use of 2/3 week i just wanted to share yes things which may be useful for other buyers os The most annoyed thing for me is that the mobile gets heated up exceptionally high
 You are not able to speak continuously for more than 15/20 mind
 It is not bearable near your ears
 so think twice before investing in this phone The reply from flipkart to this complaint was more annoyed
 Os per flipkart this is normal and it is not a defects
 os The 3.5 mm jack is not working with all the headphones.
 I tried with my last nikita headphones and it is not working Again the answer for the same was more annoyed
 Flipkar conveyed me that it is recommended that you should only use motorway headset.
 I dont know if flipkart and motorola really had any engineers with with them to convey the meaning of standardisation.
 The bottom line moto g has their exclusive 3.5 mm jack and if it works with other headphones then you are really lucky os In playing video or recording video it heat up exceptionally
 Again flipkart says it is normal and you will not get any replacement
 Please beware of purchasing on discount as you may get substandard mobile

 just got my moto g....some says it have lower resolution than previous edition,some says its speakers tear at full volume.........."people,get a life before
 starting i na tell that previously i owned a os Optimus Os coming to the phone .......awesome phone nd awesome price really..! those who have reviewed it negative may have been shipped a faulty piece,may be display is sharp nd good nd as good as moto g st gen.....looks awesome with a antiglare screen guard os i anna clear the sterno speakers are awesome.....some says they crack a bit at full volume...bt actually any mobile speaker can crack at full volume... the speakers are loud enough even at 50-60 % nd they dont crack until its v v high volume.......yes they crack a bit at full it who listen songs at the loud sound...may be some people do that,for those i have suggestion buy a subwoofer system instead :p....still i would say motorolla could have set the full volume at 60-70% of the full volume now so that people couldn have got a chance to critisize.......

 PROS: The screen size is a plus
 The battery stays all day with you
 Not at all lagging
 Camera is decent enough
 Touch is great
 Speaker output is commendable as compared to HTC honest
 Boy design is really great
 CONS: The headphones provided are not at all unto the mark.Instead buy the hawkers headphones,they might be better than the provided ones
 The battery really takes too long to charge fully but its oka
 N finally my take on it is do buy it and worthy phone co ITNE PAISE MAIN ITNA ECH MILEGA!!!

 Requested a return and received text messages saying someone would call me to "APPROVE" the return request
 Never received a call
 Called in and the CSR was unhelpful.
 Must received an email saying the return request was rejected
 Flipkart has sent me the wrong product for 2 out of my last 3 orders
 The last order they sent me the wrong product twice and I finally had to cancel the order
 His is a great phone but buy it elsewhere even if you pay more for it
 Flipkart's awful service and customer support is not worth the haste

 Very good phone and to top it I got it on the Million May sale at a very good prices
 the phone looks and feels good is very fast and I am not experiencing any lag - particularly after using Samsung galaxy Y earlier
 Display is vivid and the colours are striking and life-like os Would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good smartphone.
 I am not giving a 5 star rating only because I believe there is always room for improvement
 The only disappointment is that flipkart delivered it very late because I ordered it on the Million May sale and probably they had huge orders to clear os

 His is just another horrible experience for me from Flipkart.
 Have bought numerous phone from them and most i had to return co of grey market phone they are
 In the bargain I have lost 7000 bucks from february till november 2014.
 Plus enough inconvenience and loss of time energy and data
 Moto G and genu is a faulty phone
 Promises 1GB RAM but still most of he Pp crash mid way
 Awful display one odd day i saw all blurred display switched off and then turned on then it got sorted
 Happens every now and then
 Volume is a complete turn off and so is the experience
 Had ordered for a refund on with Act and they are still getting back to me
 His time I will make sure that Flipkart repay me all the money and time and energy lost in trusting in them
 Moto G is just an os phone a poor manes nexus
 But flipkart, of later has been a big pain in the u-know-where

 I got moto g and gen.10 days back and started using it.initially
 dint notice the performance of the battery.but
 by and and rd day started noticing the battery usually was taking more time to get charged fully,around 5-6 hours.and
 also draining of the battery was faster within 6-8 hours
 called to must
 care and the product expert asked me to use for 2 more days with phone switched off and also try it with other charges or us cables.followed the same still facing similar problems.finally
 called up flipkart and asked for replacement.they
 replaced it with new one and when i checked its battery again it was still taking around 4 hours to charge.again
 i raised a complaint and had to go for return option and defending as i was not at all happy with the phone performance which is very very poor.also the gaming quality also very poor
 os PLEASE GUYS BUY MOTO G 2ND GEN os os OWN RISK.ORASK FLIPKART os HAVE A QUALITY CHECK OVER ITS BATTERY PERFORMANCE BOTH WHILE CHARGING AND OUTPUT....
 I DONT WANT os GIVE EVEN HALF A STAR os THE PRODUCT os os TOOK os WHOLE 10 DAYS WORRYING ABOUT IT.....

 Good 1. Sure stock Android experience
 2. Value for money
 3. Good battery Full day lasting
 4. Screen Os Vice and impressive HD. 5. Tripping is awesome (handling).
 6. Dual Sterno speakers best in this class
 7. Design is best Build very nicely .
 8. Support service is West ( 1 year warranty on all os
 9. Touch is good responsive
 10.
 All quality in apiece good clear and loud
 11.
 Front camera is good
 Had things 1.
 Camera quality is average After taking 10 to 12 images in normal use it is not responding as well as whole device gets hang and warming up no it is not correct word it is heating up very high temperature
 Upper area around the camera hardware
 2. Internet conductivity is also not impressive having much trouble to using 3G. 3. Loud speaker for calling is not good and ratification sound vibration is too low
 4. Service centers are available only in big cities
 But I am 100% sure that Motorola / Google will fix this Camera and conductivity problems
 UI has to be improved
 I also request to flipkart that please convey this message with Motorola.
 I got replacement for same problem & other one
 Motorola and Flipkart gives me full attention both made goodwill
 I appreciate to both of these organization
 His is my own genuine experience

 before the product review i would like to address flipkart first .
 Dear flipkart , Your customer service sucks period .....I bought moto g and gen on 7 oct with promised delivery date of with oct .
 then it shifted to with oct and finally product was delivered on with oct i not joking .
 there was no communication from flipkart .
 your so called call canter have no clue when product is going to deliver .
 ............if flipkart didst have monopoly over moto product i would have canceled my order and bought it from some where else os product review os moto g is very attractive phone in person and in speck but there is dark side to moto g pro 1.moto g is made of soft plastic it feels excellent in hand .
 pure andros sons 1.flipkart sucks 2.moto g have major battery issue .
 phone takes more than his to charge fully .
 if your a heavy user like me you need look some where where else heavy on call not on games .
 3.moto is pure andros but it started to lag within two days
 no games installed camera is not up to the mark .
 software laws by bad in low lighting overall camera performance is disappointing
 5.google search is not working properly .
 6. volume and power button are of very bad quality
 it doesn give confidence at all
 i have previously owned blackberry bold , nikita end and ll ll .
 conclusion if your a college student and want a phone for cheap wait for some time because there will be second hand market soon
 dont buy this phone if your callers game .

 After going through a lot of reviews on various webster I finally picked one for myself
 After a weeks usage and like to say that the device is fluid
 To lag occur whatsoever
 Though 1GB RAM does look less at times it doesn affect a lot provided you agent doing heavy multitasking.
 The battery life will seem a bit less for people into gazing
 West assured
 Of you agent interested in getting into Xiaomi and Micromax and want a product with stock andros and guaranteed software updated moto g 2014 is the best at this prices

 El first thanks to Flipkart for their prompt delivery nd the phone yes u may expect everything u can get from a flagship device of a brand .
 The stock UI is super smooth only con would be that 1 os of RAM(actually 858 os unable and the battery consumption is quite high(only one day on a full charge after vigorous use rest is more than u can expect

 I have received the phone a week back I was really happy with the product and also the fast delivery by Flipkart but following issues popped up
 First of all when I got this product,there weren any Motorola log or name on the screen guards seen it when one of my friend bought it
 I didn care about it initially but when these issues came up I got a feeling like my phone is already used(?).
 sometimes I cannot accept calls when i wipe to receive the calls the phone just dont respond
 3.I got electric shock from the speaker when connected to my lawton via USB cable
 It is taking a pretty long time About 4 hrs)to charge the phone fully
 when I plug the headphone during call the phone puts the call on loudspeaker automatically
 I have raised an issue already hope you guns will provide me a good customer service

 I am writing this review after using the phone for about 25 days
 I would like to highlight the sons only
 Sons 1 Battery back is not unto the mark
 Hardly gives battery back of 15 hours with medium usage
 2. Touch sensitivity is bad and some time it will not work
 3. Worst earphones.
 It inches in the ear and sound quality is very very poor
 Everything else is excellent

 it was performing very good for the duration i used it
 but on word october '14 the mobile crashed and it is stuck at the start up motorola look even after contracting the moto help line the problem remains unresolved, i was recommended to visit an authorized service centre nearest one to me is in guwahati and being in a remote location i am still unable to get it working
 performance wise in the price range it is a very good mobile but i am afraid that i wont recommend it to others till i can get it service easily and successfully

Anand Jhunjhun...
 I am basic user with just basic internet surging FB, That & email
 st time used Android phone & I rarely change my cell phone so use one phone for 6-7 years
 Hence do a deep review before buying any phone
 To here is my review part Delivery:- not so good would give them 2 out of os where 5 being highest
 About Shone Awesome phone great screen size no cap apply super fast people use 2 view my phone & compliment the its awesome fast & looks great v easy 2 use for a new Android user like me Looks awesome from back & gives Nexus feel
 People use 2 ask me is it Nexus
 due 2 its dark black screen & thin size.just
 loved all the compliments I received & this hands made me feel special
 Plates are fast from google-Moto Pro:- Took & feel light weight slim very fast easy 2 use screen display high volume lengthy charge pre attached good screen guards auto brightness does awesome task in sunlight or in dark
 Cons:- To file explorer installed so u need 2 have internet for sure 2 download it Am Radio can not be played on speakers os no big deal
 Battery save only starts once battery reaches 15% st Handset was having huge network breaking issues other person was not able 2 hear me calls getting disconnected but was getting Awesome internet surging speed even when network was low never heated even while watching 3 hours of Soviet Voice from apiece was coming from left side ice when you talk on phone u can feel voice is more loud when you are listening from left ear & its low when you are listening from right ears
 Hence in huge noisy place I had 2 use phone 2 listen from left ear or adjust it on right ear so as 2 get more sound
 Hence assuming hardware issue with sounds & network I got it Replaced
 and Phone:- Screen guard not placed properly
 from the way it was stuck seems like it was placed just in hurry & seems like was not a factory stuck screen guards
 Also there is no log on screen guard from Motor the phone is not sealed packed in plastic
 so no way 2 know if its original or refurbished phone
 But this how Moto has kept its strategy
 so as 2 benefit by selling even refurbished handiest as new .... hence felt like I got a refurbished handset, Voice again was coming more from left side of handset, so thought this is how the phone was designed so ignored this probe
 But started facing heating probe the first half of phone from Top specially the back side area where camera is located use 2 heat a lot while using internet for one hour or using internet along with phone charging & if you receive call at same time os u can even touch it 2 your early so have 2 remove charging listen call for couple of mind from distance & then it use 2 cool down fast..but after charging again starts heating but with no use only charging it become normal
 His and phone use 2 take approve 6-7 hours 2 charge the too not reaching 100%.
 Called customer care of Flipkart for replacement thy suggested refund
 I loved this phone so didn wanted refund for sure
 still
 speed for refund due 2 pressure from years
 NOW Most Important os while the refund was in progress just 2 days before pick up os I removed the default screen guard of phone & the look of screen was just too AWESOME os believe me its like a d os super cool but then walking on sun light if you see the phone non active mode in blank screen u can see lots n lots of vertical & horizontal lines behind the glass os looked like I can see the chips behind the screen
 But thought since the screen quality is awesome hence Moto has purposely kept it like the
 Hence decided 2 cancelli the refund but called Moto G customer care for and opinion os & 2 my shocked thy told me..tht the hearing probe the the voice coming from left side of phone is a hardware issue & needs 2 be fixed at service center & vertical lines are not normal hence the phone again needs 2 get replaced
 Flipkart also confirmed the the lines are not normal
 Considering these 2 facts the voice coming more from left side of phone which i faced on both 2 handiest & vertical lines the I explored only in and hands os I decided 2 go for refund
 Heating probe is normal in all the phone even Samsung I have seen all my friends complaining about heating issue
 Also battery is just for half day with basic use but this due 2 os & bigger screen
 Conclusion:- still motor is the best phone 2 buy as it has a big big brand name behind & support of Google, awesome performance & still the best comparing 2 samsung.xiomi,asus
 os great after sales service once you are done with one month support from flipkart os after sales service does makes a huge impact It seems the either Flipkart is selling refurbished handiest or motor quality check department is missing up all the handiest os as receiving defective handiest is not common os most of my friends using this phone are not facing any issues except me os so its bit depressing the I have been left with such bad experience & can not buy this awesome phone

 I am using this phone from 10 days.For 2 days,its working properly.Then,camera started showing problems.When
 I opened the camera,its displaying Camera unable to start,if this continues start your phone".This has happened to me almost 5 times.One time when I opened the camera led automatically gets on and its not getting off even when I switched off the phone.Battery is draining really fast.If use continuously,then it drains out in 4-5 his max even you are doing only facebook,whatsapp.Then,I contracted customer care,they suggest me to rest the phone had done it.After reset,till now I have no problem with the camera but battery problem is still the same.Don't know whether this is really a battery fault in my device or it gives that much back only.But,yes I have not found any laying problem.Games are working fine.Sound quality is too good.But,heating issues are there

 I Suggested & bought this and Men for my friend
 The king of budget smartphones returns with a larger screen and a new and improved camera
 Much-improved camera Strong battery life Solid well-built design Excellent value for money MOTO G CONCLUSION: The new Moto G isn just an amazing bargain
 its a sub phone that gives a surprising number of plus in mid-range handiest a real run for its money I didn think it was possible to create a better phone than the original Moto Os but the latest version of Motorola's unstoppable hands rightly claims its crown

 I had ordered the product on Act with as a dial gift for a dear one and the product reached on October 30 (diwali was on Act 23).
 The most frustration experience was not being able to track the shipments
 I was following up with Flipkart and the logistics company Com Express everyday and they kept giving me vague replies
 Flipkart itself did not have a clue on where the shipment was and they kept telling me ' we have excavated the issue
 God knows where they have excavated the issue
 The logistics company was on a different level altogether
 They told me that there was a huge backing of orders and they cannot do anything about it
 I highly recommend that you do not buy from Flipkart if you want to gift this or any other products

 Even though there is a mistake from your side for not delivering the product on time not telling that they will deliver the product in one day or 2 days but whole 5 days
 Why canst you deliver it in one day as you were delivering products in one day for your FlipkartFirst Subscribers because the mistake is on your side for not delivering me the product on the promised date os

 I was using Samsung galaxy Os before i purchase this mobile
 Overall user experience with this mobile was good but when in comparison with Os Os know i am not supposed compare because of its prices display was with very low brightness and image resolution was also not good according to its price end its the best phone with specification and build quality 1. Camera quality Primary camera on the phone is way too much good for a Moto and secondary camera is good for video calling as it supposed to
 Also works well low light condition
 2. Speakers I found that these speakers are very good in sound production
 3. Build quality Shone sits well in short hands also because of its build quality 4. Touch response His is the major term in every touch phone
 Mobile's touch is good but when touching with nails response is not well (S3 touch works well with wet fingers and nails
 5. Waterproof quality Works well in rainy season and mushroom usage
 Thanks to the water repellent coating (S3 is not good in under water condition Overall review His is a good phone in mid price range with promised upgrade to Lollipop.

 i have used both phone right now i am holding moto go in my hand.going
 by a quick comparison display:zenfone is way ahead of moto sound quality moto is more louder and clearer than zenfone design and built a tie cause none of them look cheap and are great build motor is a bit compact but zenfone is more curly
 battery:moto wins over zenfone performance many apes like fruit ninja,yu-gi-oh am etc laws on moto but runs smoothly on zenfone also mutitasking of zenfone is a way ahead from moto may be due to higher ram
 camera a clear win by zenfone and a great photo editor as well in zenfone.

 after open the box , mobile phone on screen guard dirty spot , accessories is also out of packing / polythene bag

 His phone is quite big but if your hand is pretty big you can operate this phone with one hand .............. the display is very bright.All the things in this phone is good but except front camera because when us click pick with front cam in low lighting then its looks like baggy but in decent lighting the camera doesn last
 The battery back is quite enough for one whole day work os , I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU os BUY THIS PHONE.. AND ALSO IT'S UPGRADABLE os ANDROID 5.0 LOLLIPOP os L..........!!!

 Great product from Motor
 You can get nothing more stylish and high performance phone at this price point
 Nothing cheap about this one in terms of what you get for your bucks
 Its completely a bang for your bucks

 Worst camera quality i ever found in this branded phone
 totally disappointed
 Round quality very bad
 Automatic network selection not working video recording very poor quality
 SMS sending always failed
 Of flipkart is selling this kind of products then i m sure they will surely loose their valuable customers

 Moto G(2) is a good phone overall and price is pretty competitive took
 But there were some significant critical bugs/defects with either the phone hands or the android-motorola common and here they are 1. USB cable is not included in package - this is a bummer!!!! 2. PC-USB connections do not work for In os (SP3) and Moto Os
 I have spent almost 3 entire days to do some R&D in tache sites yet to implement the th or with resolution
 Works fine with my other lawton with In 8.1.
 Therefore if you expand your me slot 3. I have purchased 2 Moto G phone and 1 Moto G (2) phone in the span of 1 month from flipkart.
 For none of these purchases the headphone works
 His is crazy - and I have used my existing Philips, Nokia, Samsung, Micromax headphones and Moto G failed to detect the outlet and produces no sound at all 4. For Moto G(2), a little stressed usage (4/5 apes opened together remember - other than the usually just show some hiccups in the phone smoothness 5. Motorola has kept the same display clarity as of M(1) into M(2), but the screen is 0.5'" bigger so if you compare the display in 1 & os you obviously find some shady pixelated display
 6.
 Sometimes most weirdly, my home-screen pp icons disappear sometime I notice them sitting in another home-screen.
 I am pretty particular about my customized home-screens os years of touch-phone usage os LOL) and this is really crazy
 7. Of I recall more I will note them down took
 Overall its a good budget phone with lots of unable and few rubbish extended features
 But the customization of andros mitka by Motorola has been proved to be really so useless
 Note Moto G (Gen1) was perfect in terms of these strange creep problems

 I had bought Moto G phone in February 2014 and as expected it worked very well for me
 I used this phone to fulfill all my requirements such as accepting my corporate private email whatsapp, social medial taking long video conferencing calls accepting my office network and receiving calls on my telephone etc
 I was very happy about the performance
 Most office hours it was owned by my daughter who is very fond of watching couture video
 it gave me very good uninterrupted video quality
 In the morning I played songs directly from Gaana.com and no issues
 Will September months I was very happy with this phone
 Due to my mistake I carried this phone on the beach and one wave changed my life
 In a second I was phoneless.
 The water has damaged my phone and for sometime until battery was alive phone was alive but I was not able to use touch screen so was not able to receive any call
 I was out of station so I did not have access to my old phone and I was also not have access to the service center
 When I came back and went to the os support which is the only service center in June
 There is a huge rush with the Moto G related complains and somehow I managed to attract one of the customer executive and he accepted my phone in warranty and I was expecting from them what has happened to the phone and how much I have to pay if there is anything needs to be replaced
 They said I will receive a callback within 3 days
 I kept waiting for the call for the whole week but did not get any call so I started calling them back
 I kept them calling but they did not receive the call
 Finally someone answered the call but he kept saying Hello Hello but he did not reply my query
 Finally when I kept trying for one week then someone received call and asked my details and asked to picked my repaired phone after 2 days
 I was happy that my phone got repaired then I received another call after 2 days that my phone motherboard got damaged so it needs to be replaced and it will cost me 7500.
 During this time there were Diwali offered going on and I lost all the offered because I was optimistic for my phone
 Motorola should improve the overall service experience
 Finally I bought Moto G gen 2 because I liked phone but service experience was very bad

 him using the White moto g gen 16gb version Its light as a feather and Super smooth n super fast to work with
 have been using it for days and him revealing in the pure Google experience on 4.4.4
 KitKat!
 The design is understand and class
 him not using any case for it and so far the white back didn take any stains
 The Watt finish of the White back mass fingerprints and looks clean
 Easy to managed
 There is a slight tendency for dust to accumulate at the edges of the front where the screen meets the panel
 The only limiting thing is the battery
 Gives me a maximum of 16hrs with moderate use and a maximum screen on time of 4 and a half his
 Motorola Ilagin earphones of the very basic variety come within the box
 The camera is good not the best one out there and keeps the pictures looking natural
 Of u r a camera all just fall in love with the performance of this phone
 Gives the most amazing gaming experience
 Overall its a great buy

 Guys..All Reviews posted on flipkart are fake...I have purchased 2 mobile simultaneously Micromax canvas 2 A120 and Moto g 2 nd gen..Both have same specification...
 But Micromax is far far better than Moto g 2...Micromax is fast in processing Screen is big everything is gud....But in Moto g .....Motorola has copied all the features of Micromax....but it is slow in processing,,,screen os inch is false as 1 inch completely wasted because left , centre and right key is on screen only wasting the size of screen..................I felt created by Motorola......................Guys dont go for Moto g......instaed of that To For Micromax u will get more features in less price............. Very Disappointed by Motorola...........

 I bought the Moto G on the Million day offer by exchanging an old mobile phone where I got 2000 discount
 Was delivered as indicated by flipkart after a weeks
 I have been using it with dual SIM - Vodafone and BSNL for the past 10 days
 Since yesterday the phone has started giving problems
 The phone pp is not responding and I am unable to dial out
 I tried removing catches restarting, reporting with SIMS snapped - with no use
 I have to take to the service center after I get back to Chennai.

 I have purchased Moto G and GEN Os found that phone was not charging at all
 I informed over customer care to flipkart persons who advised to create Return and also advised to try it with another charger.Before I could tell them that the phone started charging with another charge and without knowing the facts they disapproved my return request
 The next day I over phone informed them the fact and requested them to replace the charger with new one because the original branded charger is the integral part of the mobile
 I then made request to them to replace the defective charge
 with new one
 But contracting them several times at their customer care they are not replacing
 His is my bad experience
 I would rather suggest that purchaser should insist for open delivery of items purchased so that they can verify the item before making payment to them
 By rating may be treated as zero

 I would say that it is the best phone in between ask and 13k.
 Features that needs special mention : * Super cool and sleek design
 gave a now feeling when i opened the box * Crisp os os display(720p).
 * Camera - 8MP takes pick with good clarity 2MP - great selfish
 * Speakers - Simply superb - Literally blown away by the Sterno speakers - Awesome os * 16 os internal memory + Micro os card sloth
 * Android 4.4.4 with sure upgrade to "Android L". * Had core speed - tried few games like Real racing Riptide - ran smoothly

 I just got this Moto G and Men phone from Flipkart and after opening the package with great excitement I switched on the phone
 To my surprise the Screen of the phone does not respond to any kind of touch
 I waited for almost 4 days for this product just to get the feel of online shopping and sad to say that no matter what purchase via com will take lot more doing to ensure customer satisfaction from the retailer side before they can make a big game changes proposition
 Saddened and all the excitement of buying a new phone is transformed into a sad experience

 The only thing bad about this phone is the old fashioned headphone which come bundles with it
 Anyway you can change them
 It has external memory which was missing in the st gen phone

 I had ordered the phone on Flipkart before Diwali.
 Although Flipkart ruined my Diwali and missed up the timelines quoting their logistics partner as the culprit the phone by itself is lawless
 I was upbraiding from a Samsung galaxy Star and was used to android.
 However the experience is beyond wonderful with the new Moto Os my friend who owns a st gen phone had recommended Moto and I had served in only after carefully considering the Zenfone5, the Samsung Began and also a few other phone like Bony Experia Z and Novo and Alcatel-Lucent.
 The Display is bright enough for regular use but dim enough to conserve battery when need be
 The touch Screen is very responsive and so is the camera
 having Motorola migrate moving my contact from the old phone was a breeze
 The UI with the Google now launched is integrated on Android 4.4.2
 Kitkat.
 The speck may not seem as high as the zenfone,but Moto have a way of optimizing the performance so they perform way better compared to other phone with slightly higher specie
 Summarizing I would definitely recommend this phone although i would add that it takes ages for the phone to charge with the Moto provided charger and that the earphones seem too cheap but perform as expected from Motor
 I would expect a more flashy/customizable pair of earphones thought
