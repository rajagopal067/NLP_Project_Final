 I am deeply disappointed with this phone
 I love Motorola products but this phone was a lemon
 All the reviews i read and people i asked said this was the best budget smartphone, it isn't.
 After about 3 weeks people complained about me sounding "echoey" and a lot of static
 It only got worse to the point where people could not hear me at all
 It didn matter whether or not i used iii calling or not or Bluetooth or not
 I did all the recommended rests all to no avail
 I suspect a bad microphone
 its a shame but this phone was a complete waste of money and i am unlikely to buy another Motorola phone
 The sad part is that i only had it less than 3 months
}

Assaf Sadeh
 I got this 3 phone 3 months ago and i am very much disappointed
 The phone works really really slow
 It takes forever to view photos or to delete a photo
 getting in and out of countries or in and out of wife network has prove to be really difficult or impossible the gas takes 10 min to update sometimes that really annoying when you are driving somewhere and need to choose a route
 - downloading and installing applications is so slow ind rather just ask my wife for her phone.the
 only good thing i could say is the camera works good and the speaker works goodwill and all would not recommend it at all
 I am sure for a $170 which is what i paid you can find great chinese honest
 expected so much more from a motorola phone

 Ve had this phone for 3 months never dropped it its in perfect condition and give had so many different problems
 First my battery will be at 90 percent and i turn the phone to sleep and i check it again 5 minutes later and the battery is at 50 percent .
 i know this is not just my phone give bought a new phone 3 times so each phone has only been about month old
 Second problem the phone will be on lock i have a passcode on the phone
 i will take it out of my pocket and the time will be in a different format and the time zone is totally wrong this has happen with all three of the phone give had
 I dont recommend this phone to my worst nightmare .

 It took os dumping their support of WebOS for me to make the jump to Android.
 The Moto G was a good choice to do that at the price for an unlocked phone
 The guaranteed upgrade to Lollipop was pushed out a while ago nicer screen better battery life that makes it even cooler!Flawless with AT&T, I dont care that its not full Os LTE, it does everything I need it to even watching Affinity To on data works fine.One complaint and this has nothing to do with the phone Hang still hasn released a screen protector for it
 Really disappointed in Hang for that
 His is the first phone out of 5 or so in our family that doesn have a Baggy
}
{
Josmat Velasco
 Still not sure about this one
 I found the screen big enough to navigable but too big to use it as a phone
 It feels like using a tablet to call and I have to use a hands free set as an option even when they dont came in the box another minus is the absence of USB cable for charging because I work all day on a computer and we have few plugs in the officer
 Sometimes the screen freeze when it comes to rotate the image
 Maybe I was expecting too much from Motorola but is not quite a deception
 You certainly get what you paid for but my personal recommendation is Huawei P6.
 Lighter faster friendliest and comes with all the accesories.

 I use the default pp to listen music "Google Lay Music and it slow down a lot it looks like it continues playing the song but the phone stops responding and the sound also stops wont be using this phone for anything else than making calls because everything else just is too slow camera is slow photos loading is slow gallery pp is slow I canst even play games because the phone just slow down random (I'm not talking about Os with awesome graphics games him talking about simple 2DS side strolling games that even a pageboy color could render faster than this phone).It's a total deception
}

P. Williams
 I want to say that I love this phone but canst
 I have had a ton of phone over the years - dozens in fact
 His phone probably has the best screen or on par with my work Iphone5.
 It is likely has the best performance and is the most high teach
 The build quality is great took
 Size wise its near perfect took
 I do really like this phone but I dont Love To - it lacks some palace or special feature that really makes it stand out
 By the way I speed for the and Men Os instead of the st gen Os LTE and I am glad I did
 The better screen and camera are worth it
 Os is great and not that slower than the LTE in my area
}

Jason Bennett
 His phone is amazing for the money
 I got it as a lightning deal for $150.
 The internet connection is fast enough for mostly anything you want to do even if it doesn have LTE.
 The screen is perfect battery is great and update support is GREATLY appreciated
 His phone has already been upgrade to Android Lollipop which is rare for a phone in this price range for an update to roll out so quick
 I like that this phone uses an almost stock version of Android without any tack skin on it or bloatware apply
 The fact the the memory is expandable is a great thing took
 Motorola really hit the nail on the head with this phone

 You canst imagine how amazing this phone is Everything about it seems lawless
 Speakers are amazing and are as good as lawton speakers
 Camera is mediocre, yet amazing hence the price tags includes an sd card slot for all you music cries and anti-clouders (jk.)
 Battery life not bad will last you a full day with light to moderate use
 Anyways, my advice get this phone like now because you will not regret it at all

 I recently got this phone and its an awesome piece..I am using it with T-Mobile prepaid...This phone is so good...
 You wont be disappointed at all!Though i love the phone... just thought and mention two IMPORTANT things which I wish it had but it doesnt:1.
 Comes with only phone and plain charge
 To facility for data cable...no slot provided either
 A workaround for this would be to remove or os card and use it with another card reader to move data.2.
 You also dont have any slot to plug in a pair of earphones to listen to music n stuff..a workaround for this would be to use a bluetooth enabled headset...meaning go tireless :)Nevertheless, D still rate it 5 for its super voice quality and battery life!!! Part from an imp Same latest andros version n stuff!Highly recommend this super super phone...best cost effective phone with amazing specs!!!!

 Amazing phone !!!!!!! Holy cap him impressed by this phone !!! Front facing speakers are great !!! Feel of the phone in hand is great os
 Even the screen is amazing for a 720p screen you canst tell the difference and you know what the breaking battery life is great on this phone I give it a 9.5/10 and only because its not LTE but its still HSPA+ which is almost as fast as LTE in my area I get anywhere from lips - 22mpsIf your looking for a great smart phone and dont want to spend over $200 get this phone
 You could get 3 of these phone for your family for the price of a new high end phone

 Awesome phone
 I needed a good device for Geocaching and running Ingress
 Originally purchased a Chinese alone of a Samsung NOTE from Amazon
 Had to send that back because of charging issues and the poor GPS performance wandered all over the place!).
 His Moto G is great the GPS locks on quickly and even gives accurate reading under fairly heavy tree cover
 By GARMIN Oregon doesn work this well no GLONASS).
 And having a pure Android system is really nice
 I dont have to hack the phone to get off all of the june that you get from a phone supplied by the cellular provider

{

 Great phone
 if you think you need to spend a lot of $ on a phone look no further because the Moto g and gen is a nice phone for an unfordable prices
 the imp camera is decent
 the design doesn feel or look cheap at all it exceeded my expectations for a less fancy phone after looking at the samson galaxy s for a while
 if you dont need a lot of features like eye strolling this phone is perfect
 the battery life is okay but gets drained faster with wife on.Motorola has done a good job with this phone and I would definitely recommend this phone to any age
}
{
i_reader
 He own 3 of these phone and love them
 Vice crisp display
 Better-than-expected camera
 Expandable memory os be sure to add a memory card and store photos and multimedia there as internal storage is tight
 Rarely feels lagged or much slower than my Nexus 5 which cost x as much
 Our oldest one is nearing 1 year old now in teenager hands!), and has given us no problems aside from a worn out connection on the charger.Note that the replacement for this phone has been announced and may be available for purchase now
 Early reviews suggest that it is better yet
}
{
Amazon Customer
 GREAT phone - the single complaint is a lack of LTE.
 But considering what packed into this device its still a bargain for a device which perform quite well
 Nicely sized display bright screen CPU candles everything that been thrown at it including many games speakers sound GREAT, battery life is as expected reception seems good and a lack of tons of third-party june just plain Android - nothing else to interfere with the experience os why agent all phone like this
 His is our and Moto Os and I wont hesitate to go back for another should the need arise

 Excellent product for this price range.Very good definition and loud and clear audit came with the basic and necessary software so that the device take full advantage of their power and memory.Gorilla Glass display anti-scratch with good brightness and contrast.After the first power on it was upgrade to the latest version of Android (Lollipop 5.01)It have MicroSD and naso SIM slots.I would totally recommend as mid to high range smartphone.In case of choosing a new one I would choose it again without hesitation

 I bought this phone for my Other and she absolutely loves it
 its a great phone for the price range it allows her to have all the features of a smart phone without signing a contract and spending a fortune on something sheds not convinced she needs or even wants
 He were very impressed with the camera quality and the expandable memory is great
 He also loved that increase in screen size from the moto g which I own
 I thought it would feel too big but that hardly noticeable - what is noticeable is the giant increase in ease of use and utility

 I actually received my phone few weeks back from the United States via a friend
 Of ism not mistaken this is not yet for sale in Ri Vanka
 To far its a pleasant experience
 The build quality performance and handling is really good
 I have earlier used a Motorola feature phone (E398) which i really liked for its durability.
 Hence i was eager to make a yet another Motorola purchase
 I was not tempted to buy the st gen mainly due to the lack of os slot.But the and Men is a great product and highly recommends

 Within 2 months of purchasing this phone the touchscreen died
 I tried to get Motorola support to help me with fixing this but they kept walking me through the same nonsense 3 different times with same result
 When you call them you get support out of Phillipines which is fine however they dont track case numbers and their computers always seem to be running slow or are "down".
 Disappointed with the product but even more disappointed with the service

 I should never have sent it to them for replacement
 Return for credit and purchase would be the only option

 Any Motorola product is always a Great Value.UPS - FedEx - Target - Amazon + Any more Fig corps
 all use Motorola manners / walkie-talkies, Why??
 Because their stuff is real it works it takes abuse & ''keeps-on-tickin" These phone make the other Company's Had because they offer so much value of so Little os Does Google Buy / Invest in june
 you know the answer... ---> They bought Motorola <--- Must buy one & be done with the phone thing and move on your life : )

 Incredible phone especially for the price.My previous phone was a Galaxy S3.
 While on paper this phone is a step down on speck in reality it feels much faster and nicer
 More or less stock Android is another bonus.The build quality is excellent - even though it is made of plastic it feels solid
 The screen has very nice viewing angles and good colors
 The only downsides are the 8GB of storage and lack of LTE but in my case HSPA+ is fast enough and an os card makes up for the lack of storage

 I have had this phone since about Christmas so about a month and so far it is amazing
 I had lost my job in October and my Samsung Galaxy died that week took so I was without a smart phone for a couple months
 I was worried about spending less because have always bought the biggest and best
 I do not regret getting this phone one bit
 Admittedly I do have to keep my apes to a minimum because it is only Os of internal which every pp has to be at least partially installed on but him totally comfortable with that
}
{
M_L
 His phone is quite the value
 It runs all my apes smoothly and doesn feel slow
 Camera is also pretty decent better than I expected
 The sterno speakers also surprised me sounds better than any smartphone I had before
 Even though this doesn come with g LTE, it still does HSPA+ and I can get ~7Mbps where I live which is plenty for web searching and streaming os video
 Glad I didn spend $500+ on a phone when this thing does everything I want for $180.
 want wait for the Android 5.0 Lollipop upgrade

 Ought 2 of thesePro's: Android UI is super smooth and fast there no no lag ( I do not play video games so I cannot judge for that)One of the first to get Android updatesVery good battery lifeCrisp clear screenCheap priceMemory upgradeableCon's: To LTENon-removable batteryNow people may say this feels flies or cheap compared to a Samsung S5/Note or a HTC phone but those are premium phone which cost 3 - 5 times more than this phone

 Love it Its a BANG FOR YOUR BUCK.
 Three things i noticed thou 1 front facing camera is a little lagged and 2 your lock screen can be different than your wallpaper, 3 the femoris on here look different than regular femoris so I had to download a separate pp just to see what the standard apple femoris look like him Using global version on Simple Mobile in Chicago , no internet plan so the lack of LTE doesn even matter
 It has basically all the cool speck of other high end phone for only 179 os
 Eff-yeah!!

 A great phone for its prices
 It first when i upgrade to the new lollipop 5.0.2
 OS right out from the box i had a significant performance and battery drain issues
 I figured out the cause of the problem was a system ache partition which was reserved from the older OS causing all kinds of performance issues
 well how to clean it it took me 5 mind to do it
 All you have to do is goose how to clear system ache partition in Moto g second genu and follow 3 very easy steps that would save your life

 Suddenly the network connection stop working if i put out the him and put it in it work for like 5 minutes but then it loses it again
 i talk to motorola and they told me they couldn do anything for me because i was outside the US.
 Its important to know that there no andros L for the unlocked version even there some version that have it since november
 i talk to motorola customer service and they just talk me round and round again without answers

 Too heavy
 Door battery life
 Screen too fragile it cracks at first drop os feets).
 Motorola recognize this fault and they do one-time replacement but only if the purchase was made from motorola stores
 I choose the nexus 5 for a better experience

 A decent phone but has major memory issues
 Running any pp that uses significant memory causes all other apes to force close
 Want to have goose maps navigation and listen to music
 One of them is going to force close
 Now about talk on facebook messenger while browsing the web
 One of themes going to force close
 Os a bonus sometimes apes take up to 30 seconds to launch and the keyboard will shutter for a long time
 The phone has been like this since September and Motorola has not fixed it yet
 wont buy a happy product until they fix it

 I hate this phone
 its the worst waste of money I have ever made
 The touch screen stopped working after only 3 months of use
 The OS (Android 5.0 Lollipop) is a complete disaster the apes keep closing on their own and last
 The phone charger stopped working after 2 months and have hated using this phone almost after the second week of use when it started crashing
 I have factory resented it formatted it and nothing has worked
 To dont think its a virus or anything like that this phone is actually factory hardware damaged
 Of you want a good phone that will never let you down get yourself and iPhone.
 I had and shone Os myself but I got robbed so have bought two andros phone since then
 A cheap $80 ZTE V790 which turned out to be absolutely a piece of cap and this one which want significantly better if you consider the prices
 To I now swear I will never pay for another andros phone in my life again better save a whole year for an shone that waste my money again on an Android phone
 And just for the record the worst part was still Lollipop.

 I am very disappointed with this phone.Was looking forward for this phone
 few days after I started using it I noticed that The phone becomes slow after about a day of use
 many apes becoming slow and crash
 Facebook , What-sup, Messages etc .
 In order to make it work I need to report the phone.Some times it will report by itself.Sounds ridiculous to me to report it every day
 I have never experienced these kind of issues with my previous Samsung S3.Update 11/06/2014:I returned the phone and ordered a replacement .
 The was some improvement in performance and better battery life , but instead of reporting the phone every day now I should do it every 2 days
 Some times even I am not able to make a call before the start Os installed Facebook pp then Swift Key keyboard whatsup, Messages+.
 Nothing helped
 I was really confused by where all these 5 stars reviews come from.How can it happen only to me on both honest
 And finally i found a thread on motorola owners forum with people having same issues[...]Is it too much to ask for from the best budget phone to work stable
 Nobody else who purchased this pon on Amazon has similar issues?Returning the second one took
 Really upset and disappointed

 Once I get used to this phone it will be oka
 I really miss the back button and being able to use my own recording for my ringtones and alarms
 There are several more features I had with my old phone that all have to live who
 But for a less expensive phone its oka
 And if you've never had the more expensive phone with all the bells & whistles this phone is impressive for the $$$.

 Used for about 5 months
 The phone delivers on all the promises it is good looking sturdy with great screen decent camera and battery and plenty of processing power
 Build quality is excellent and I keep it in a case since new no screen protectors thought lasts 1.5 days on me easily so the battery is very good indeed.Lack of a card slot is not a problems since I charge it form my lawton while in officer so transferring all extra files to os is easy and that before the clouds storage.It is a little low on RAM- with the amount of s I installed it is 72-79% taken so I have to use dedicated apes to close all the apes in the background all the time.Camera is worse than my other phone (Nokia N86), but still ok for the price.Overall, a very good deal compared to the phone my colleagues are using.In fact I ordered the new version of the Os and this one is going to my son

 The phone worked good for a while until it was dropped and the screen broken

 I owned a Nexus os 4 that after 2 years of use it went south crumbling the screen and since some of the pipes failed it was impossible to use
 I bought this phone on the recommendation of my son and have really liked it
 It works as it should but its faster and has some features that are nice offered by Motorola.
 Of course new is always great and the best part is I didn have to cut off my arm to make the purchase as the price is more than reasonable
 Would recommend the purchase

 Larger screen micro sd sloth improved speakers improved camera Lollipop earlier this months and the price are just part of what make this phone great
 It is so sleek looking and fast and makes the samson touchwiz look like a kid designed it
 Everyone asks me what kind of phone this is and where I got.The only thing that would make this phone absolutely perfect is if it came in go

 Not even good for basic calling
 him had my phone for a little over a month and now have sound issues
 Internet research tells me that this is a known issue that happens when the phone is used repeatedly in a quiet location
 Silly me I like it quiet when I make phone calls
 Apparently this is liable by downloading the firmware but I dont know if its even worth my time
 Second Motorola have had The other was about 15 years ago
 Both were pieces of cap within a few months
 I should have known better
 all go back to os or Samsung.

 First off - The Global GSM version bought in the os os NOT dual him
 Otherwise it is as described
 One of the best phone for the prices
 have had a little slowing down when using ram intensive apply but that just the nature of any phone with this specie and its honestly being a little picked
 A little bigger and heavier than last years model the battery isn quite as good but again being picked
 You will not go wrong by buying this phone

 Once I got used the settings it works fine
 The screen looks great and I like the size of the phone as far as holding it
 I am a light user and not a pro at all but I really like this phone
 It may not be as fast as the newer high dollar phone but it is os for what I use it for
 I wanted something better than a entry model and didn want to pay hundreds so after much research I went with this phone it seems to be at the top or very close to the top of about every ones list

{
LuluSa
 Works great so far
 I especially likes the big os screen size and the camera quality
 Of you want a phone with quality that surpassed its purchase value this is it
 Only complaint that I have is that the battery door is super hard to open and it took me a while to insert my him cards
 But that is not a big deal at all and perhaps this is an advantage because the battery door is not easy to open so that it would not break open even if the phone is accidentally dropped

 His is my best phone yet twice as good as the Motorola Atrix.
 its fast smooth intuitive, and bargain-priced.
 I miss the Atrix's dedicated car-dock, but aftermarket generals will have to do
 By AT&T data plan is a grandfather unlimited usage 3G, so this 3G-only phone is perfect for my needs
 Motorola cells the phone directly for the same $179 price as Amazon but I bought from Amazon because no one else has their level of customer service

 His near-stock unlocked andros is extremely impressive given its low prices
 I find the os screen to be the perfect size and it is brighter and more vivid than my old Nexus 4. I was pleased that it was thinner than I imagined but not so thin as to feel very fragile
 him a little annoyed that I am still waiting around for the Lolipop update as it pushed to my Nexus 4 about a month ago but overall him pleased with Motorola on this one

 for some unknown reason ( it has never been wet or dropped it just shut off
 I thought the battery was dead so I plugged it in
 About a half hour later I go to try to turn it on and the loading screen came on
 But it stayed on..and on and on
 It wouldn shut off or actually load to the home screen
 And of course this just happened on May th and my window for returning it for replacement was up on May th os Am lost I dont know what to do

 EDIT: I ACTUALLY GOT ANOTHER ONE os THESE & AFTER TRYING os MANY PHONES!
 I LIKE THIS ONE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK.
 os os HAD LTE, os WOULD os PERFECT.
 BUT THE "4G" HSPA+ GETS THE JOB DONE.
 Well first off I am not sure how others here are getting such great battery life
 His is actually one of the top letdowns on this sequel And I know how to manage a devices battery
 It drains very quickly
 Also be forewarned front that if you are getting it because of the front speakers you will also be disappointed
 Compared to the original these pump out less decided volume
 I actually had to use an equalizer pp from the play store to make it better & always have to fiddle with it
 I am not sure if Motorola thought that by moving the speakers to the front that they should lower the actual volume
 But it was a poor moved Both the first Moto G & the Moto X are noticeably louder
 Also while HSPA+ "4G" yes is unable when off of wife
 I have noticed on several speedtests Os am on Mobile at the moment that its just not very fast sometimes only around 1-2mbps.
 It is just not as happy in general as the original
 To in closing I am sadly returning this
 It is a shame too as I liked the larger screen
 I would say that the only thing they improved on with this
 Oh & yes the camera is better
 but not a whole lot
 I actually like the way shots looked with the flash in lower light on the first G better
 With this one the coloring is a bit to bright looking sometimes even when you dial back the exposure
 Again having to use an pp to do that

 I was excited when I purchased this phone as I had done quite a lot of reading about it and other phone too although mostly Motorola and Apple honest
 It is and generation so it has the sterno speakers on the front and more importantly it has an os sloth
 I have to admit that it is heavier than I thought it would be
 Heavy is not necessarily bad it feels solid and I dont notice the weight so much when its in my pocket
 Leading the specification is one thing but actually having it in my hand is the real test
 It is also quite large which I dont dislike but once again I was a little surprised
 The phone is about the size of the new Apple shone 6.
 The curved back that people say gives it a good feel is not noticeable at least to me
 Perhaps for people with smaller hands it is
 I find the back of the phone does not really touch the palm of my hand
 its like holding an shone 6 (I've held other peoples phones).I couldn wait to try it out and this is where I have some concerns
 Intuition does not seem to have played a part in the design of the graphics user interface
 The camera set up is strange and the messages management seems strange
 Also when you want to make a phone call (It's a phone - right?), even though you have contact set up not a great experience it does not display them
 It only displays people you have recently called
 You have to select an All Contacts" button to see your directory
 Adding a phone number to a contact was not easy the first time and him not sure I remember how its done
 Why doesn a phone display the dial pad right away when you press the phone icon with maybe a contact button as well there plenty of room on the screen
 When you have to use the manual to figure out how to use anything its not a good sign.Perhaps its a sign him getting old but when the phone rang I pressed the white picture of a phone - no go I couldn answer the call
 All this intuitive?
 Head the manual and you have to wipe to the right to accept the call wipe to the left to decline
 I missed about three calls before I read the manual and him not ashamed to say that
 I dont want to read the user manual to figure out how to make and receive calls on a phone
 Also you do not tap the name of the person you want to dial you need to tap their number
 have worked with many GUIs and this is not very intuitive.
 Back to Steve Sobs methinks and just pay the price for a great designed bought two of these one for my wife and one for me
 He are using the unlocked phone on a service provider with no contract and a $20/month plan for my wife and I that covers some data and a good amount of voice and messaging.
 I will not pay $120/month for a phone service even if it is cellular
 He do use cellular on our heads so that helps with data because its cheap and the carriers are reliable and provide excellent coverage.So the jury is out and were both not as excited as we were
 By wife had a terrible time getting out of a Google set up loops
 It felt to us like the phone was a used phone given that it said she had a previous account and behaved differently to mine
 The Google terms and conditions were about 17 pages long and written in legalese.
 There are about three different agreements all long minded and a good cure for insomnia
 I have not consented yet I need to know what Google is trying to lock me into
 hats another story.It was tricky getting the back off its not as easy as the user guide makes it seem and you feel like its going to break the first time you try
 I installed a new micro-SIM and a 32GB os card in both phones.I took a couple of photos and with a hand held camera optical made stabilization would be a good idea but the photos are not bad in good light
 His is not critical for me given I have an had that I carry around constantly
 Same with browsing and email.Google Now is interesting
 Click on the Google icon and say "OK Google" and you can speak a search string like Now far is it from the earth to the sun?".
 Lingo you get your answer - what a great pp
 Fire does the same thing of course and I dont know how they compared
 The os radio works well
 I used my own headphones - no problems
 Quickoffice looks interesting and offers a form of words expel and powerpoint.
 I haven really tried downloading apes yet and I suspect I need to get through the various Google terms and conditions before I can think the price point for this phone is great
 Must under $200 for the phone compared to over $600 for an shone if you want an unlocked iPhone.
 Locking into a contract for over $120/month for phone service is not going to happen in our house.We will persevered for a couple of weeks or so to see if we can get used to the new interface and find our way around a little easier
 Of it doesn work out well there are cheaper option out there for smart phone and phone service

 I was extremely happy with my shiny new Moto G Second generation until one hour ago when it went completely dead !
 I turned it off to get a start and now it does not respond to any key press
 It had 60% battery so it shouldn be it Os also plugged it in and still no response
 I even tried pressing the volume down and power keys for two minutes and nothing
 I am so disappointed with it
 I can not send it back because I have it in Argentina now and the shipping only would amount to almost as much as it cost.This is my first and last experience with a motorola phone and it has clearly been awful
 I would never ever buy or recommend another motorola product for the rest of my life.Hopefully I have not lost all my data since I still have my old Samsung S Advance phone which worked reliable for almost two years.Motorola sucks dont buy this phone unless you anna gamble on yours working properly
 Of not you are risking losing all the data you have on your phone would give it 0 stars but I cannot

 I bought this phone a little over a month ago I wanted to wait and see how it did rather than writing a review like oh it came out of the box and its so shiny
 I love it
 Well at first it was nice the only problem I had was how big it was coming from an shone os to this was a huge difference
 I still dont like the size its hard for me to text
 The phone worked well for about 3 weeks and now its not doing so great.1.
 The charger it came with is lose and I have to set it just right for it to charge if you bump it it moves and I wake up with a dead phone sometimes.2.For some reason when I go certain places the internet completely stops working the wife and the g and also in these places the bluetooth wont work
 To if you have a tablet I guess you could bring that in case you need to get online for some reason.3.
 The memory is very low obviously
 But one day the phone wouldn let me do anything because it kept saying there was no memory
 I delete a couple pictures and then it worked fine.4.
 I have a constant ratification that my messages are not being sent although I believe that they are since I have tested it with people sitting next to me
 It first it was one then two and now it always says 8 messages couldn be sent
 When I click on this ratification it just brings me to my messages and doesn show me any messages that haven been sent.5.
 Sometimes while I am looking at my phone I see messages appear at the top and then when I go to my messages to open the new message it is no where to be found
 I guess I am just lucky when I see the ones I do that way I can text the person and ask them what their message said.Of course I am passed the date to return the phone when all this stuff started happening so maybe all give it to my daughter to play on
 its not a HORRIBLE phone... but it isn reliable
 I think all go back to my iPhone.

 Sure Android 4.4.4
 out of the box is awesome.
 Sterno speakers have become something I will ask of all my new phone find a Sterno domo on youtube).
 The only negative things I can call out and its minor would be the volume and power buttons are a little squishy and cheap feeling but they work fine

 Great phone with a great prices
 There is some random slow down at times but that expected with a budget minded phone
 have owned a moto x first gen and this phone acts very much the same only difference I can tell is that the always on os goose now feature only works if the phone is on any home screen
 His moto g will still read text and let you respond while driving which is the top feature of this phone and the moto x in my opinion

 Excellent phone
 It ha a nice curved case which fits nicely on my hand
 The display is nice and everything is sappy enough for me
 I love the form factor ready it actually fits in my pocket
 His isn a blazing fast phone but it runs lollipop and does all the nice smooth transitions flawlessly.
 I mostly text play simple games brows the web an listen to music this phone works fearlessly for that and you canst beat the prices

 Works as expected looks as expected.Nice set of features for the price tag - good looking screen
 Good design - fits well in the palm.Battery goes out abruptly sometimes but lasts for a good period of time.Nice photos and very good video @720p.Front speakers do make a difference compared to conventional bottom side speakers of a os Os for example).Overall highly recommendable budget phone os

 Before this I had a Samsung Note1.
 But this phone looks much better than that
 Were are the reason:1.
 The screen size is good
 The battery life is really good
 I am loving it
 It goes more than a day with heavy use
 It may go 2 days if you use moderately.3.
 It does not come with extra app.4.
 THE PRICE.Only things motorola may add a headphone for some extra money

 His phone is already amazing to me and have only had it for a few days now
 From the Android KitKat OS to the sleek design/options of a phone that is under $200, I canst ask for more
 His will be an excellent phone for me to hold onto for a while and not jump to the note 4 in a few months.P.S.
 After have had this phone for a month and really have a chance to see what it can do all write a more thorough review

 have owned this phone for over two years and its still a great phone for basic needs both voice and text features are dependable.

 His is a very personal review have had a couple of andros phone before from different brandy
 Motorola is recognized as a communication company what makes this phone powerful is the reception have been in places where the other phone are out of line already this one really impressed me

 His is an incredible value.The native Android experience has been amazingly good
 Recommend you change to the Google Now launched as it is a great upgrade
 him surprised how good the integration is with T-Mobile, the voice mail testing email and exchange-email all seem to be working very well
 Plus they have promised a Lollipop upgrade sap without having to worry about my carrier.Bluetooth integration works well
 I use a Roadster 2 in my car and a Logitech HT800 at work the integration is great
 Plus with the Google now Okay Google) and MotoSpeak pp for hands free driving
 The launched seems to make the calls hand free most times with only occasionally having to repeat the command
 It very nice to just ask it to play a song or artist and it just does it.I'm using the os GSM version and with T-Mobile, him seeing LTE like speed with HSPA+.
 have seen couture video saying you may get more bandwidth on T-Mobile with HSPA+ than an overloaded AT&T LTE network
 Music streaming and pp downloading has been great no delays
 20Mb apes from the play store seem to be downloading over HSPA+ in about 30 seconds.The MicroSD slot was great
 I took the 32GB card out of my old phone and put it directly into the new phone
 It carried over all the photo's, music audible books podcasts etc.Even though the body is plastic it has a nice shape that feels good in the hand
 Once you put the phone in a case that plastic body becomes a non-issue.
 He ended up buying four Moto-G unlocked here and we are all really happy

 Stop doubting His is DEFINITELY the best phone for the prices
 People are complaining about the drop in fixed density it is ONLY noticeable on paper the display will simply blow your mind
 The battery life is still AMAZING.
 The stock Android experience is everything you ever wished for fast clean simple and intuitive.
 I reviewed the original Moto G only after 6 months of ownership to give an opinion as honest as possible and everything I said about the st Men still applies here check it out under my reviews
 Amazing phone and one investment you wont regret

 The 2014 Moto G is a really great phone
 By primary phone has been a Moto X for the past 10 months or so
 I love the phone but wanted a slightly bigger screen
 have been testing others - the Nexus os the os G2...
 I have been tempted by the Os but dont like some of the os tears that you canst get rid of without going with a full custom ROM.
 The Nexus 5 is good but I just didn get into it.So when Moto announced the new Os I thought and give it a shot
 I had played with a 2013 Moto G and liked it but it didn blow me away especially compared to the Moto Os
 The lack of LTE doesn bother me as AT&T generally has excellent HSPA coverage in the US, and I dont do anything that requires LTE speed
 I ordered the global model in part in the hope that it would be dual SIM - alas I can confirm that the global model marked here is NOT dual SIM.
 Regardless I am very very impressed with the hands - the screen is excellent particularly for the prices
 In my opinion the lower resolution is not noticeable even when next to a Nexus os which has the same size screen but with a 1920x1080 resolution
 The Nexus and the G feel about the same in build quality
 all have to put it through its paces to see what it can really do but I dont know of a comparable hands for $179 with no contract
 The real winner for me is the micro card sloth
 I am so happy to have expandable storage.Strangely enough I feel like the device is an upgrade from the Moto Os despite the slower processor and lack of LTE.If you want a device that costs very little has excellent build quality an awesome screen a nearly stock Android experience with a few minor Moto improvements expandable storage and generally speedy performance... look no further
 His is the one
 all be playing with this phone for a while at least until I can get my hands on a 2014 Moto X for cheap

 I really liked this phone I was doubtful at first because the phone didn have g let But it is just as fast
 I really liked the 720p 5 inch display it is really sharp I also liked the front facing sterno speakers
 By favorite feature of this phone is that is upgradeable to andros 5.0 lollipop, the phone comes with andros 4.4.4
 mitka out of the box but could be updated
 The other thing that I liked about this phone was that it is just like a nexus it has stock andros with a few Motorola apes and tears that actually improve the phone

 Added a 32GB micro sd card extra $15), and now this has more memory and similar screen size than an entry level in or in for about a rd of the price.Have two of these must genu and and genet
 and gen has definitely better sound and conversations are much clearer than st genu although this might be a software issue must gen is still on andros 4.4.2 from Consumer Cellular and hasn been updated in a while).Ideal for anybody who is not dependent on the iSomethings.
 There is virtually nothing you canst do in this phone that you can on an in
 The screen is os easy to ready acceptable camera and most apes you actually "need".
 Plays apes such as minecraft, candy crush heads up clumsy nina angry birds racing Email youtube, HBOGO, chromecast, Google Caps Xfinity....EVERYTHING.
 Dual camera bluetooth, wife everything you actually need in a phone
 You can even run FLASH with the dolphin browser, no jailbreak needed
 Of you need to edit video or large documents use a Desktop Computer
 Although there are many apes in andros and os for editing nothing beats a real desktop computer for the job.Picture taking is acceptable for everyday/casual use many apes for this as well
 Was a LED flash which can also be used as flashlight/strobe light with the right app.With an pp you can BROWSE and manipulate files as you would on a desktop PC.
 Significantly less expensive than other andros phone as well.If you feel it platicky eyes the back os plastic just get a decent cases
 After all everybody I know ends up putting a silicon/plastic case on their phone anyway.Paired with chip from Consumer Cellular (AT&T mvno), I have a great solution for my been who doesn care much about communication features as much as games - we pay $35 a month for TWO lines
 Limited minutes and data but since we spend most of our time in wife we dont really need it.These phone are so expensive you dont feel you are going to loose a fortune if misplaced or lost.If you need a better camera I wouldn buy a phone not even an i6), but rather a real camera
 With the price of this phone you can even have money left for a full DSLR to take professional quality pictures/movies.With the play-store, and many other services around this is even a good alternative to the touches - with the added benefit of being able to make real calls when necessary

 os I bought directly from amazon...the first phone worked for 13 days and the screen went black...

 You can get a lot of phone for your money and this is a great example
 I had a Samsung phone that was obsolete but I also use a Nexus 5.
 His phone is pretty close to the Nexus os but you can see the compromises
 First off the screen is not as sharp as the higher resolution honest
 But it is not a grain screen like you get in the least expensive honest
 I was surprised and and definitely rate it good enough".Some similar phone try to get by with 4 os of memory
 I dont think that is enough even with os card storage
 The os card slot basically gives this phone more storage than the Nexus 5 32GB version
 The 1 os of ram shows up if you try to do two intensive things at once with this phone
 It will have trouble which means it will dump the pp you are not using right at that moment
 Os its not perfect.The camera is close to the one in the Nexus os but the Os is not considered to have a great camera
 The Moto G feels smaller and the body is very easy for me to hold
 The speakers sound pretty good a bit better than the Nexus 5.
 The GPS in the Moto works quite a bit better.It's not an LTE phone but most buyers will be on data plans with limited data I assume
 The Os is fast enough to do most things and you canst sit and brows for hours with a low end data plan.Right now you can buy a Nexus 6 or an shone Flush but its going to be around $800 with the sales tax
 Those are the top of the line honest like the Note 4. Of you want it and dont mind the prices go for it
 These are luxury honest basically
 To scale back a little the Nexus 5 is still around but that is around $400 with 32 GB.
 His phone is half that though you need an os cards
 The Nexus 5 has better hardware no question but were getting to where most of the decent smartphone processors do a good job for everything but gazing or multiple apps.There are at least 4 tiers these days
 You've got the most basic stuff Palmar cells for Straight Talk the $100 or less Android.
 When you have this phone in tier os with some of the BLU stuff some Basic Samsung honest
 The third tier is probably last years quality honest like the Nexus 5 or the Galaxy S4, maybe an older shone or a refurb.
 And then the top tier is the shone 6 or Nexus 6.
 I think this is a great phone for the prices and compares well with the next tier up
 Of you want the top its a LOT more money

 Called Motorola service which lasted for several hours before I called a halt to it

 Excellent pick in bright light although in dim light not as good as iPhone.
 But at 1/3 the price of an iPhone, I canst complaint
 Definitely great quality for a reasonable prices

 For the money just good practical phone
 Does everything for a third of the prices
 Only complaint is the Google really wants you living Google.
 I have to forward all my third party email to my Google account in order for the phone to keep them for reference
 That is why I will go four stars

 Sterno speakers
 Recent battery life
 Great value.Cons: His phone has trouble managing its go of ram
 Processes will get killed often

 I love this phone
 It is not a Os but it sure is hard to beat for this prices
 It does lack LTE but I am not a real heavy non-wifi data user
 For me this replaced a Moto G st generation and this is a step up from that
 Since this phone is not tied to a carriers updated come much sooner
 I got Lollipop in 12/14.

 By teenager had been using all the very expensive phone for years but a friend got this cheaper model so he wanted one took
 I do not use cell phone so I cannot detail all the qualities he loves
 Sorry and he is not up for reviewing anything
 He has had it for only a short time so canst do any better than this

 I had a horrible experience using this phone
 Most often it gets automatically hanged
 It was so disappointing on motorola's part who failed to make the good software update according to present scenario.It's better to stop old version phone and try to develop new phone better.*Don't
 lose Customers

 I have to be honest I like the phone but it drops signal for about a minute 4 to 5 times an hour rendering the phone useless I Babe it 2 stars because of fast shipping and good condition however it keeps dropping signal and it is not the service provider as I tried multiple services its the phone its self
