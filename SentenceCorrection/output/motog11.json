 But when I received it was an awesome phone
 I observed below two problems after using it for 3 months a
 Os moto go is an optimized phone on its original model moto go but phone battery back is NOT optimized at all and it last only for ONE day
 The phone needs to charge every day
 by
 After capturing a continues VIDEO for more than 10-15 minutes the phone is getting warm (HEAT) and got hang for few seconds
 Motorola should pay attention to these problems and provide some FIX for the same
 Thanks

 hi every one I bought the moto Os phone for 12,999 Os from flipkart.Their Master delivery is good.The sound and camera Quality are fine But the piece,though Android, is lacking of some basic Pp like Conference Call,Voice recorder,file manager,mobile Security pp Master draining of battery even though him not a crazy of games.BIGgest drawback is the CAPs key is missing
 ice for each Capital letter of a word we have to use shift key every time.Even the ear phone of MOTO (USA) products are very hard n cheap quality.Detection of Os network by dual Him cards is badly earlier Samsung touch phone is better than this in Internet access and Indian Micromax cells around ask r far better than this as told by my friends
 To folks i suggest u not 2 prefer Moto G2,unworthy from a os brand

 os NOT UPDATE ANY GENERATON os MOTO G os LOLLIPOP !!! Android 5.0 looks cool with its material interface
 Hats what actually drove me to update to Lollipop.
 But once I updated the UI started to last
 Applications started to take time to open
 Even the menu would sometimes freeze
 I desperately started to search for solutions in online forms
 I tried everything including clearing the phone ache partition but nothing worked
 I had this wrong image in my mind about stock android, that whatever the hardware might be if its a stock andros it will never last
 But I was wrong
 New release of Androids are only focused on Nexus
 To expect a decent andros experience after OS upgrade you either have to buy the coming Nexus device with which the new OS is released or buy any existing Nexus device
 Wont trust me Update it
 But once you are done dating you can roll back to Kitkat.
 His is said by the Motorola Customer Are Executive
 Well you can actually... but you will have sacrifice your warranty
 Good luck with that

 I sincerely recommend to buy only Motorola....it is the best.... you will feel it once you own it.....
 Were I want to salute Flipkart, yes salute for the service promptness, commitment and response etc....I think Flipkart is the best online seller in Indian
 Thanks to Motorola for wonderful mid segment smart phone and thanks to Flipkart for delivering it to me...

 I actually changed back to Android from Windows.....(read,Lumia 1020 to Moto G 2)....wanted to downsize for some personal reasons,especially the former being an equally powerful cam phone with a shopping camp os Tendon flash camera
 Now this Moto G2,I read a lot at it & most of which was good actually
 I was thinking of buying a Xiaomi, Honor 6.....but decided on this Moto G was I loved the Lollipop interface on a friends phone & also there are certain apes that I needed to use,which were not available in the Windows Store....After spending the 2 days with the Moto G os am loving it.....On the downside,the box pack doesn include a DATA CABLE & the hands actually comes with KitKat not Lollipop,out of the box
 Camera is gud,for a imp
 Low To 720 is an added advantage I must say

 His phone in this range is really good
 Os per performance it works well
 Very smooth and responsive
 camera quality is also nice but the video quality is not so great
 Screen quality is also good but not excellent maybe because of guerrilla glass
 Os per Head phone it is very ordinary
 Company dont provide with data cable
 Over all this phone is best in its range than other phone

 Flipkart delivery is spot-on.
 Good mobile for this range

 The hands has awesome look...This is my first ever smartphone...All the features seems great
 To doubt the phone is a masterpiece...But earphone is very worst...you can get this kind of earphone in local market for 100 bucks....I dont know why but Motorola's concentration was only on the handset...earphone could have been much better..If you are a music lover then you will have to buy a good headphone... Charger seems poor in quality...Heats after one hour of charging...but its ok... Overall hands is great To for it... all write my next review after using this phone for some days

 Am not going into the speck and comparisons as there are decent reviews for that
 It has been less than a month since i bought this product.My first impression of the product was very impressive
 The touch screen is decent and resolution could be better(but it is definitely up to the standards
 The power and volume buttons are very well located
 Holding the phone and the quality is simply outstanding for the price we pay
 Already received the lollipop update and the performance is enhanced noticeably
 Battery is top notch
 One of the best thing is an option for expandable memory
 Final say Hang for the buck
 West phone in this price range
 Definitely feels better than all the samsung's, sonya and nokia's in this price range

SUNIL BHARDWAJ
 I am resident of Amritsar Punjab.
 By wife who uses this phone commuted daily to Medical College Jalandhar.
 I purchased Moto go in Act 2014.
 Recently I received Ratification for Lollipop updated
 When I started download on the night of 29 An 2015, it got stuck at 15%.
 I waited for 45 mind
 But it didn increased
 Finding no other option I restarted the phone
 In starting the download automatically resumed from 15%.
 In completion of download it asked to installs
 I clicked yes
 When it showed shutting down dialogue and then the screen after start showed Motorola log with lowered by andros written below
 That was it and thereafter it got stuck there
 I waited for 01 hour but nothing happened
 I thought the process of installation is going to take long
 To I put the phone on charging as the screen was on and then I slept
 In the morning I found same thing on screen idea
 Motorola log with lowered by andros written below
 The phone couldn be switched off
 I had to go to Medical College Jalandhar with my wife
 To I decided to go to Motorola service center at and floor Monica Power Flap How Jalandhar.
 But they told me to go to New Days Enterprises SCO 11, Khukhrana Complex Canal Road near Hair Palace Pain Road Jalandhar as that is the authorized service station for Moto go bought from Flipkart.
 I went there
 That center was just awful
 There was a single person who seemed careless about what he was doing
 The aluminium partition was shut from inside
 You have to give the phone and communicate with that person through a window
 I told him the whole story
 He removed him and memory card and disassembled the phone
 I was surprised as I was thinking throughout that it was a software problems
 When he took the phone to a well covered corner in the room where I couldn see what was he doing
 He took 10 minutes for inspecting the phone
 When he said that it was a motherboard problem and I would have to leave the phone there
 I said I canst leave the phone as I have to go back to Amritsar in about an hours
 He then reassembled the phone and when he put back the him he said the lock was broken
 When I asked how he blamed it on me
 I was furious
 When I checked myself the lock was intact
 I wondered that the guy who canst tell whether him lock is ok or not is quoting problem with the motherboard of the phone
 When I went to Medical College Jalandhar I showed the phone to software engineer of the os department of the Medical College
 He told the problem was that the new version didn install and old version got removed
 He is confident that he will be able to install the software properly
 I became depressed with the pathetic after sales service of Motorola.
 To doubt The device is lawless but the service centers are just pathetic
 I even came to know that they remove the original LCD panel of the phone and replace them with the face ones
 All this has been a rude shock to me
 I was a fan of Motorola device but now I have to really think hard whether to buy Motorola phone in future or not

 Ought the phone when it was first launched(Sep-end) from Flipkart.Was going good for a while(only minor hiccups like difficulty is starting phone when the battery drain).Come Jan,the phone went into a report cycle.Took it to the service centre and was told that the mother board needs to be replaced.Been like a couple of weeks and haven heard back from the service centre yet.Its a toss up between which is crappier,Motorola's phone or it service
 Bottom-line: Have been a user of Nokia,Samsung,Sony and HTC in the past.But the worst experience give had is with Motorola.Pathetic phone.Wouldn't recommend it,even to an enemy
 P.S.Phone aunt worth even a single start

 The moto G improves on what its processor lacked micro os card slot,beautiful os inch display and 8MP camera .
 Gros -5" display front speakers are loud n clear no network or call drops -8MP camera takes amazing pictures when HDR mode is on micro os slot up to 32gb bones there were no bones in the device whatsoever but the charger shipped with this phone heat up like a often rocky
 And battery performance is average

 hello all since from with An , i am facing issue in this mobile and what strange i got to know when i reached to Motorola webster that IMEI number which is register is not under warranty i have register the case to Motorola team with the given voice its still not given any results
 when i called Flipkart they send me mails twice that they need more time to call me to resolve the issue means here is that once you purchased the brand or product you are never been take care because its all business

Sreehari Tholikonda
 I Everyone just i sharing my experience with this mobile
 I have purchased this moto go in flipkart online in Dec and dont know my bad luck or not i got touch problem in 40 days
 so i am not able to return my product as it is valid for days only
 after that 1 year warranty replacement for any part of the mobile
 this is one things
 the other thing is there is no dedicated service center for motorola.
 Evident technologies is service center in chennai for many mobile vendor like HTC, Motorola etc Response with service center is not good
 Camera Quality is very good which i feel very happy in this mobile

Sagar Gurav
 His is my first smartphone ordered on the very first day of Os release
 Also as promised by Motorola, got update of Android Os Rose os Os has really very stylish look(gorilla touch :)) as compared to other mobile of same range
 Also 5 inch screen fits perfectly in my hand
 os Front camera takes really nice series os Round quality is good with dual speakers in it.(but
 dont expect sound like beats audit :P) os With extended memory card sloth it complete your memory requirements
 os Also Android L makes MOTO Os perfect mobile in this range
 West all the features mentioned are as mentioned so I dont want to explicitly mention it
 Sons os I am quite not satisfied with rear camera (8MP thought
 os Battery drained
 Needs more Power battery since 5 inch screen + android(battery drained os ONE MAJOR ISSUE, I noted several times is that whenever my battery gets fully discharged and then when I plugged my charger to charge and kept it for few minutes(10 mins).
 After that I tried to turn on cell by removing charge but it didn start for 20-30 mind and was continuously showing battery % in charging state(though charger is removed whenever I clicked the power button
 It was quite annoying
 Later it automatically got started after 20-30 odd minutes

OJ SHRIVASTAVA
 Experience I purchased two units first in 13K for my father in October during launch
 Based on his positive feedback I risked for me
 Ought Second under old phone exchange program There I returned my previous phone Bony Ericsson WT19i at Os + Os off on HDFC cards
 And got this one for 9K, nice deal ah !
 But even if I had bought it for 13K, its worth !
 Degradation to lollypop - Was in doubt whether to update OS but eventually it was worth
 There is no lagging wet performance UI is refreshed
 I dont see anything wrong in updating.
 - Only issue with the phone is its now pretty common in the segment but if that doesn bother you To for it

 I ordered the phone for my father who was using the smart phone for the first time
 When it got delivered it had lots of dead pipes & he did not know that it was a feature rather than a defects
 When I found out few days later I called flipkart and they were brilliant in sending me a replacement
 The replacement is brilliant - so a big thank you to the Flipkart service
 Now coming to the phone itself - be careful what you wish for
 It is a 13K phone and comes with features which is apt for that price and no wonder it has 4 rating with over 18K reviews
 I use Grand 2 so I am comparing against that
 1. Display brilliant but dont compare it against Galaxy Grand os which cost another 3 K more
 2. CPU - very comparable
 3. RAM - 1GB vs 1.5 in Grand 2. Os if you are looking to install lots of games that use too much RAM, think twice
 Of you are more whatsapp/facebook/phone call type person then this may be the phone for you

 Caution To not update to v5.0.2 Lollipop due to bags somewhere in the software battery life is passively decreased and you would hardly get 1-2 hours of screen on time
 Not only moto Os is facing this problem but other devices nexus 5 & moto and genu which were updated to lollipop are experiencing same issue
 His is a vital problems if in any case you have already updated to lollipop version wait for motorola to patch it
 anyway Device is great

 Recent confirm for 13K.
 Build quality is good
 Not Lollipop update took
 For games It does perform okay not bad
 Sometimes you ll be thrown out of the game (I'm facing this issue in shalt 8).
 Camera very good in outdoor as well good in indoor but not like outdoor performance In terms of focus and quality),Indoor noise you'll find in the pick
 Front cam is decent to take selfish
 Battery performance is little disappointing.Overall it is a good phone to buy
 To need to worry much about the quality , It has good quality in terms of build
 If and data speed is very good no issues found so far
 have been using this phone for 3 months and It restarted only once by itself when I was watching online cricket

 robust for rough use
 do not forget to buy a good quality cover from flipkart itself it proves itself useful when you later drop it umpteen times

 moto g was supposed to be motorola's recovery vehicle and what a way to roll ...

 A very trend and fast moving mob and a best choice for anyone who would like to show off or in search of a quality product... Delivery is very fast and was delivered in two days without any delivery charges or any extra payment for a quick delivery is needed
 Was quite dissatisfied with the accessories for I received white colour normal speaker for a 13,000 worth products and White charger for my black mob and USB was not included...
 But I am very satisfied with this Shiny new toy of mine... Really Awesome os

 I got this mobile two months back os and was enjoying the same...
 But one day my hands fell down from 2 feet height and the whole gorilla glass was cracked badly : Now the service center is demanding approve
 7000/- for replacement idea more than half the cost of phone for screen only
 That a system of recovering the cost through repairs and charging the huge amount for small repairs
 RATING - 4 star for phone
 - 1 star for after sale services

 I strongly recommend that please buy the each and every electronics items from shop near you or authorized dealer because as per government new guideline now the policy changed for online shopping in new policy product purchased from online stores will be treated and services by different services centers and also consumer is not able to claim anything on company
 To just go and buy from stores only may be the product cost differ little bit but customer can satisfied with services

 His phone is really awesome for the prices
 Rose Good processor Little last Hardly any lag when i updated to Android Os Very sturdy His phone is very sturdy
 I have accidentally dropped my phone at least 10 times till now
 To crack on screen or anything
 Very sturdy as compared to other good phone like asks zenfone 5. Later proof His doesn mean that you use it while in the pool
 it can easily bear some water on the surface
 Expandable storage unto 32 by
 Long with my 16 go internal i have external 32 by
 memory joint a problems
 Updates(Moto g is one of the st phone to receive Android Os Sons RAM- only 1 go hence multi taking is a problems u can play heavy games on medium settings
 Camera i did not like the camera pp of moto go
 very average interface
 Battery life same as the moto go
 The screen of moto go is bigger than its previous version hence battery is consumed more
 His phone should have had more battery life
 Speakers The voice somewhat cracks at high volume(smooth voice after upbraiding to Android Os I dont know how Os compared to other honest this phone is very good(Asus zenfone 5 has stronger processor and 2 go ram better display but it is fragile not specified as waterproof voice quality while calling is not as good as moto go display not as bright as that of moto go In short Moto Os is an all rounder for the prices
 In my opinion you should go for it
 His is my personal review
 Hope it helped :-)

 it goes off any time but does not automatically catch the network

 as a product it is quite good
 battery back up is decent and all
 The only problem thus far is that it lacks in essential things like a file manager or my files lacks the option to set default storage device as os card which can be irritating if I want to conserve space in the phone by transferring the files to os cards
 When I want to do that I have to mentally transfer the files everytime

 There is not at all a single problem i have faced after buy
 A very decent and preferable device i have ever seen OTG support full he video and it supports all the functions as mentioned in the about part
 Only sons i can talk about are ~ First the battery
 It should be of more power
 its drainage is very fast
 It drains like a flowing water while transferring files using OTG.
 In heavy usage using internet battery can lasts unto 7-8 hours
 ~Secondly, The display is not very pretty as compared to the old Moto Os Its colors is not as much bright as moto go but supports full he video without any last
 ~Third, Motorola Headphones are of very bad quality
 Even in full volume it sound very slow and not be considered as a good quality earphones.
 Samsung or other are very good as compared to motorola.. Beside these CON's the new Moto G and Men is very cheap and best phone
 One should prefer it under the budget phone Thank You..! os

 I was looking forward to this phone as my birthday present to myself
 I was utterly disappointed with the model as the basic audit of the phone had an irritating disturbance
 I experienced this disturbance each time I attended or called someone
 I wanted to get the phone replaced but the customer service agents would just not do it as easily
 I was asked to follow a troubleshooting exercise which did not resolve the problems even so my ticket was closed as the customer declined the request to replace the device
 In my third attempt I was lucky enough to get it replaced
 Finally I was eagerly awaiting the new hands as I thought only my earlier piece had this audit disturbance issue
 Os soon as I inserted the him to check the audit , I faced the same issue of audit disturbance It is to my utmost dissatisfaction that I am writing this review as my experience could not have been worse
 Of it is a company defect then it needs to be highlight immediately and I believe products when going for replacement should be checked once to be sure that least the next time the customer is not left dissatisfied

 3. Speakers are awesome 4. 8MP camera liked most 5. battery performance is average Thanks -Nagesh

 When after using it the I thought of buying one for myself
 To I purchased another for myself
 His story continues and now my whole family is using MOTO G and Men Software is upgrade to lollipop.
 Battery back is the best
 To laws at all
 To heating problem I faced till now
 Only problem what i feel is the screen responsiveness.
 Touch screen respond is not that effective
 May be because I am using screen protector on the screen which may be causing the problems

 Still after playing with it I really impressed with motorola.

 Anyway To i went for Motorola G(2nd Generation)... Motorola as mobile is very steady and reliable phone..(I have earlier used Motorola Defy plus for 2 years believe me they are quiet rugged mobiles..However I was quite not happy with Motorola after sales service in india..Hope it has improved

 That moment I checked its updated
 Why ear piece volume gets heated within short duration of called
 Why ear piece volume just goes to maximum without my intervention

 In my opinion this phone is the BEST in its price range
 It candles apes very smoothly and without any last
 But some minor features are missing such as voice recorder self time camera and it doesn have other video recording size option only 720p.
 But this can be obtained by installing some apply so not much of a problems
 It doesn support may vi move and some more video formats
 But os Layer supports all video formats hence this also isn much of a trouble
 The panorama is one thing i found very poor about this phone but still its ease of focusing, lighting and image and video quality makes us forget that
 Overall i would recommend it to all who are searching for a good quality phone in this price range

 Ordered Moto G and Men Mobile Shone on 19/01/2015 and got the delivery on 22/01/2015.
 When I started using the phone it just happen to check the internal storage capacity of the phone
 To my surprise the storage capacity was only 12.90 os & not 16 GB.
 His is gross in accuracy wherein the product is advertised as having 16 os internal storage capacity but in reality it is just 12.90 GB.
 His is kind of cheating done by flipkart with the customer...Will Flipkart provide any explanation on my above grievance???

 It is best option in price range bow 10 k to 15 k in similar range etc 616 is closer but etc 616 has 4 os of internal memory while moto Os has 16 os internal memory

 His is a very nice phone... feels solid in hands and good performance for the prices

 I became customer of Motorola with its Moto G series
 I was so happy with it that I got whole my family either a Moto Os or Moto Os And when Moto Os was launched I was happy to realize that I can now have a larger moto G with much better speck at optical cost
 But alas Moto Os has disappointed me
 With larger display comes the proportionately larger forts and icons which means still seem like you've watching at a loomed in phone
 I needed a larger display to space more items on screen
 However it just got them bigger in size
 Part from this nonsensical issue the major two issues him facing are 1. Quick battery draining as the os display requires larger capacity battery which Moto Os certainly hasn't, and 2. Overheating.
 I dont know what wrong with this series but Moto Os has a serious over heating problem during charging as well as during working on it
 Os now that many alternate option are available in market I wont suggest anyone to buy Moto Os

 they promised to give Hittel data plan and I am still waiting for that to activate
 To all buyers please confirm that whatever offer you speed you get it on time because this time flipkart team told me that your time expired and we can not do anything now

 Used this phone for more than a month now and would say that this is simply great
 It has amazing CPU performance with simple stock Android.
 I have installed a lot of applications and use them frequently with lots of games and faced no issues till date
 His phone has amazing sterno speakers and a good video performance though with a semi-hd screen
 In the negative side this phone could have more battery back just 2030 may for os screen
 The headphone is actually bad but you can substitute this with a headphone of a better company Os use peri z headphone with this one and it is amazing
 1GB RAM will not be sufficient but still this phone does not last though it may terminate heavy duty applications at times

 I booked the Moto G using HDFC credit cards
 Later on my order was canceled with the false reason that the order was returned delivered by courier partner
 One of their courier partner contracted me
 Since the month of October 2014, this has become the usual practice of Flipkart that they accept too many orders and are not able to deliver and they have to cancel the order by giving such false reasons
 In our country commerce business is not widely acceptable due to such kind of unfair trade practices of the vendor like FLIPKART.
 Going forward delaware while dealing with Flipkart

 The first issue I faced as soon as opening was the charge
 The charger gets heated very soon even when used for just 10 to 15 minutes
 Otherwise I find the phone worth the money

Abhiraj Darsh...
 I have been using this phone since 4 months
 Works butter smooth
 To lag of force closes yet
 Twitching between apes if lightning fast
 Very high-end game played ran smoothly mostly giving 40 FPS.
 Sure Android feels great
 Display is just awesome and proves to be the best source of entertainment(Games and couture mostly :P) in boring lectures
 The voice commands and Moto Assist are just amazing
 Friends usually end up playing allot on Os
 And when they start to annoy you just shout out Take up Falix" and Moto would listen even in a noisy environment
 Ambient|Active display is very helpful
 I never use the power button to clock the phone it just knows when you are around or anna play with it and wakes up immediately
 Well that all the good stuff
 Coming to the bad ones I would like to exclusively mention the battery
 The battery lasts for a complete day on normal usage around an hour of gaming etc
 Of you forget to plug in your phone at night still be useless the next day
 I would be happy if Moto could have squeezed in a larger battery
 A friend bought an shone 6 recently
 I was playing around with its camera and that was the first time i realised how bad was os camera in low light
 him not a professional photographer but i still expect Moto to work on the camera
 West all about the Moto X is green
 Of you have an opportunity just go for it blandly except photographers).

 I bought this phone as a gift for my mother
 And it has made a total phone adduct out of her
 His is a big thing because before getting this phone she was not that high on the idea of new and coming technology ( only because it took her time to understand it.).
 I canst give a true user review but my mon looks very happy using it

 Also note that i bought a Micromax Os instead of buying this phone
 I have put up my review for that phone

Aditya Devalla
 REVIEW AFTER 2 WEEKS os USING MOTO Os THE GOOD • Vice build quality • Smooth usage multi taking • Stock android, no in-built unnecessary apes THE BAD • Battery life is about 12-18 hours but him assuming this is the problem with every android.
 Takes 3-4 hours to charge from 0-100% • To OTG cable provided THE UGLY • The earphone quality sucks big time
 Even the Os
 20 earphones that are sold near railway stations are better
 Surely a ask phone deserves a better earphone P.S: Increase your budget by 1000Rs to buy OTG cable/power bank/memory card/earphones

Saurabh Bhivan...
 His wont be a phone that you fall hard and fast for
 It wont sweep you off your feet nor will it dazzled you with a slew of whizzing features
 hats just fine thought
 Because none of that changes the fact that the Moto G is still the best budget smartphone you can buy today
 Using the thing isn as regulatory an experience as firing up the new Moto X was but Motorola's long list of seemingly modest improvements collectively add up to a device that worth your attention
 It was one of those badges that wound up being more than just good enough between the price and performance the Moto G was one of the best cheap smartphones you could own period
 I would have myself bought this phone if not for Xiaomi MI3, but since I could not buy it for myself ended up lifting my Aunt
 And it has worked just amazing as well
 The entire functionality makes more sense in the amount of price and features it consolidated for the given structures
 And nonetheless the performance is still beyond mediocre.
 Its simply stunning
 Additionally, the new lollipop features must work equally well ( I haven made the update as yet but sure hope to do so
 Oh phone is overall brilliantly built for the Indian consumers & I bet you shall like as well
 ( Skipped the speck part since everyone is already writing about it as commonly as they should be

Gursharan Dhillon
 I purchased moto go for my son who is engineering student
 Overall the package is very good look & design screen resolution camera processor speed etc
 I liked this phone very much and ordered another for myself to replace my 2 years old Samsung galaxy ace
 After just few days of usage I dropped the phone accidently which all phone users will do some or the other day
 To my surprise the much publicized Morning Gorilla glass screen broke into pieces
 I have dropped my old phone not of times but never ended up in this manner
 After recovering from this shock I called Motorola service centre to ask the replacement cost ( I understand well that leakage cannot be covered under warranty
 His is the time I got next shock replacement cost is 7000, idea more than 50% of the phone value
 It was too difficult for me to spend another 7000 within one month of spending 13000 on new phone
 Now I am again using my old phone need few days to make up my mind
 Motorola shall advise customers on fragile nature of screen & heavy replacement cost
 Special protection screen can also be recommended so that the customers do not blame Motorola at later stage for keeping them in dark
 I will request customers to make informed choice no doubt this is an excellent phone deserve 5 stars but if you ever drop this for any other phone with glass screen be ready for spending a large sum
 Hope my review will help you Gursharan

 better pay a little extra and buy samson or sonya devices as you will spend much more of money and time in its maintenance

 4. Limited service centres

 I purchased this product in December 2014, everything is great but there were few issues like 1.

 But after lollipop update these issues are resolved and everything is normal

 Flipkart is doing fraud
 When I order it they cancel it after 2 days

 Using this phone for more than a months
 Rose Price - To other device comes close in offering the same features for that price range Recent processor - no lag so far on medium gazing
 All Quality - didn have any issues with noise / rebound Screen size and its 720p resolution Neutral : Speakers - not loud enough - but managable want comment on expandable memory / camera - as I dont have much use for them
 Sons Battery - Continuous gaming drains the battery in < 5hrs.
 Also charging takes around 3 hours
 Head phone - nothing great about them
 Definitely not suitable for listening to songs/videos.
 USB connection to os is not available in the package
 Fool device in the price range - To for it os Also flipkart's delivery is spot on for one-day delivery

 Of you set the brightness on auto then it will adjust to a variety of light conditions so that the screen always remains readable - unlike a few other sets I have seen where the auto setting does not give good results
 Readability under direct sunlight is pretty good
 The sound quality is okay
 It is not as good as say a Bony Xperia, but still the speaker output is okay
 The sound does start to crack if you listen at full volume
 Round output to a headphone is much better
 Battery life tends to be poor
 I am a moderate user and never play games on my device or brows for long sessions
 I use it with wife thought and the battery hardly lasts for one full day
 But today I got the Lollipop 5.0.2 upgrade so lets see if the battery life improves
 Overall I am quite satisfied with the phone
 Sinus one star due to battery

 I bought this product from flipkart from day one i am facing issue
 First time shopping experience on flipkart was very bad
 Looks like flipkart delivered me defeated peace of mobile
 I raised a request of exchange they are saying you need to deliver it back i can do that not a issue but i bought mobile when i was in my home town (Rajasthan) and currently i am in Bangalore(Karnataka). Flipkart executive saying you have to courier back and they will deliver on same location my home town which i have no use .
 I requested them to deliver in bangalore but flipkart not ready .
 His is last shopping on flipkart from my side
 To more shopping on flipkart.
 bye Eye Flipkart.
 Thanks for not helping
 Single star is not for mobile it is for flipkart service

 The phone is a good one but if someone orders the phone from northwestern or eastern part of Indian I would suggest them to keep around a months time at hand before they get to lay their hands on the phone
 Flipkart's delivery services are growing worse day-by-day, and they are least gathered about the customers until they cross the deadline of delivering the products

 I purchased this mobile one month ago
 I believe 13,000 is good deal for purchasing this mobile
 its very handy and touch is very good
 Front and secondary camera clarity is good
 It has 1 os Am which access the internet and brother very quickly (3G).
 Of you play any games in this mobile never it get hanged
 Dual loud speaker which gives quality of sound when you are listening music
 Due to huge internal space we can download lots of games and useful apply
 The only con what i felt is built battery which is not detachable like other mobile
 To we have be careful of battery life

 outstanding Have you used this products
 its always better to review a product you have personally experienced
 Educate your readers Provide a relevant unbiased overview of the products
 Leaders are interested in the pro and the sons of the products
 He yourself be information Met your personality shine through but its equally important to provide facts to back up your opinion
 Met your facts right
 Nothing is worse than inaccurate information
 Of your not really sure research always helps
 Stay concise He creative but also remember to stay on topics
 A catch title will always get attention
 Easy to ready easy on the eyes A quick edit and spell check will work wonders for your credibility
 Also break reviews into small digestive paragraphs

 His product is one of my best busy from flipkart.They delivered it on time.The screen is wide and the display is wonderful.Touch is awesome.It is the best phone and is better than Samsung Os because of the price difference
 Moto provides the same features in a comparatively lesser price.The only setback is the battery capacity.It is not very bad but could have been better.Battery is good if Os is not used.If used also it stands for about 14 his

Nagarjuna K
 Good One but Battery issue Cam quality is fine performance wise and look wise Moto Os is superb but the problem is the battery that drains very fast as it comes with 2070mah ,,,if the battery is 2500mah then it will be 5 stars

{
Roshan
 The way I heard it seemed like it was a great product but to my astonishment it was totally a flop as its speaker sound goes bad in the higher volumes as well as its look is not as per Moto standard advertised look as it looks almost duplicates
 Please reconsider your needs and then after you see another person using the same or telling you higher experience to get a good phone and dont go for the advertisements
 Though good branding hats off to Google.

Dipak Singhania
 The phone clarity touch flipkart delivery everything is good but major problem I am facing is the POOR NETWORK catching capacity of my phone.It goes out of coverage at places where other phone on same network have complete coverage
 moreover it disconnected the going call if the network drops suddenly while other phone would just maintain the call even though we may not be able to talk and revive as the network is received.Because of this a fresh call has to be started which cause loss of money of one call
 I dont know if this problem is with my phone or with all Moto G 2 phone
 Believe the Moto G will come up with some solution

 For a price of 12999, this is one neck of a budget phone from Google!
 The operation is battery smooth despite 1GB RAM.
 Simple and intuition stock andros controls make your life a breeze
 Good battery discharge lasts me almost an entire day close to 17-20 hours with wifi/data on whatsapp, facebook and twitter on while listening to music
 Those who look for a budget stock andros experience with ZERO last excellent hardware quality and a pleasing to hold phone go for this

 got this mobile on nov 15 2k14 and the service offered by flipkart is good
 have been using it for two months or so till now i didn find any lag on my phone..every thing works like a charm and the touch experience you get with this phone is battery smooth you will truly fall in love with that amazing technology motorola has equipped with..previously i was using a windows phone and when i checked out this phone when my friend bought this i wished to grab one for me..thanks to its inch display which offers amazing clarity..it doesn feel too big but its fit in your hand easily..i had a white phone and looks wise it feels like a premium set..and the camera is just amazing which is a 8MP shorter and also the front camera which is 2MP is good for video calls..but in complete dark with flash os you might find some noise in pictures and in day light conditions the pick and also the video clarity were awesome..and you get a stock andros experience on this which is the most appreciable one due to which you wont find any lag..call clarity on this phone is good its loud and clear..and for me battery lasts one day was not a power user and with the data on it lasts pretty good actually..i was really wondering how motorola could manage to put in extraordinary features in a budget smartphone..its a very value for money device..you can blind go for it

 Good product given the price sensitivity and features
 To trouble so far
 The only issue was that offer for replacement of old phone which was was used at the time of buying this product appeared on first screen of order and was not there at the time final order placed
 Most delivery calls with lip part executive and their response against my query was extremely poor
 I decided not to buy from lip part thereon and am still stick to it
 May change my decision in future

 Sons High Usage of Os or wifi-hotspot or gaming drains battery too fast
 Took is not much encouraging while comparing Sony/HTC products but which costs more Of switched off while Battery is under ~3% requires a lot of patience/effort to start the mobile again while charging...
 I think its not getting started till your battery reaches level 10% which sucks sometimes
 Rose I like the Camera & Talk to me feature while driving & home
 Overall Performance is good

 I have bought Moto Os two weeks back.Earlier I have used Samsung Galaxy Grand and Foka Gumma 520.Compared to both the phone I have found this amazing in respect of UI and also performance when it is compared to other andros device under 15 Os Rose os Took and feel of the phone is awesome.
 Shone looks very beautiful from the front and back with sleek design and amazing finishing
 2)Screen: The screen is very vivid and very smooth with Gorilla glass but it is not scratch proof).It has an amazing colour punch
 3)Camera-Both the front and back camera is very good.Picture quality is very sharp and colour tint and quality of the pictures are very rich.Low light pictures are also good .
 4)Processor:processor is good.No lag still now have already installed many apply
 5)Signal strength is very good
 6)It has a solid Build Quality
 7)Gaming and os Video recording is not excellent but it is good and met my expectation is certainly better than samson phone under 20 K 8)16 B internal memory and applications take less phone memory when transferred to external memory card since the andros is vanilla and original from goose in the device like nexus
 9)Speakers is simply superb and video call quality is also very much satisfactory Sons os Battery back up is not as good as moto g 1.
 But it is still good
 2)File manager is not delivered here.And pictures cannot me moved directly from the gallery.Either
 You have to connect to os or have to download a file manager
 3)Very bad War phone os I really doubt its hardness...I am sure it is not like galaxy grand or other samson /Nokia device,You have to use it delicately os There is no data cable provided in the box It is an amazing phone from worlds first mobile phone manufacturer.Only through online sell It has spread like hell.You can go for it blandly
