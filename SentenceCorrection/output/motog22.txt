 I reviewed and liked the Data is
 I reviewed and liked... although less as a pure phone the Fire Shone
 Both cost roughly as much as this at least when the Fire Shone is on sale as it often is).However, for the typical user who doesn use Crime who likes pure Android, who doesn have a use for dual SIMs, and who can charge every night the Moto G is absolutely my recommendation
 I got it for my daughter who keeps it in this case and who loves it
 The fact it is splash-resistant is a huge plus for everyone but especially for midst
 The dual front-facing sterno speakers sound great and media looks fantastic on the large screen
 8GB is pretty mediocre, but the fact you can easily expand that with a cheap micro card makes up for it.It's stable well-designed, well-made, and just works

 him surprised more people dont know about this phone its a great deal there tons of reviews on line , you tube etc the drawback is in setting up the bring your own phone service once you've done it once the second time would actually need only maybe 20 mind I used trap phone and picked AT&T towers works fine its GSM, carriers as you set up the service it ask you what zip code your in and that how it pick your phone number
 I never got a smart phone before because of the high cost this is 200 bucks and 45 a month for the gig service , beat that actually the big phone company are starting to offer similar plans ( out of the goodness of their heart In the us Take sure you are ordering the us version and genet the andros updated to the latest version automatically on the first day.May I suggest the common cases its military grade and fits like a glove

 When I saw a video on couture about Moto G and generation opening basic apes faster than Galaxy Os I thought it was gimmick, but I was wrong
 After some weeks of using the phone I have to say I dont regret on buying it and and recommend it Os already did over any Samsung Shone on the same price Bier maybe even higher tiers)Camera its not a top-notch one off course but it works decently on natural light conditions you canst ask for more for what your paying.The phone its really responsive for its price range vanilla andros makes it fast and fluid and its upgradeable to the latest andros version (5.0 Lollipop) already
 Battery duration its optical unless your gaming you can last a whole day with moderate usage.Built Quality seems sturdy and phone itself so heavy so you can add a protective case without making it so heavy

 have received without problems
 His cell comes with charger only no us cable(for pc), no headphones.
 Fortunately I have more than one old cell phones)...I'm using it 4 days ago and the battery is nice today have shared music through bluetooth to my car for about 2 hours full volume then in the job i was listening music from cells maybe 4 hours(wifi enabled navigable about 1 hour...at the end of the day cell battery consumption was less then 25%.
 its fast no last
 But its not too good transferring files (e.g.
 16 of multimedia file from os through an us cable is so slow less than 1MB/s), but if you transfer files to the sd card directly for using an us adapater) all is oka
 All in all him happy with the product and the prices I only need it to call an receive calls to listen to music and navigate, i dont have time to play games
 I recommend it

 His is an excellent phone for the money and is probably the best budget Android smartphone on the market
 It has a very good 5 inch 720p IPS screen very good sound with dual front speakers decent front and rear camera a quad-core processor and an os card sloth
 It feels solid and substantial in the hand
 To Motorola's credit the Moto G is delivered with an almost completely stock Android 4.4.4
 KitKat, with only a few Motorola apes added
 The lack of any UI alterations to Android is a plus as the phone is sappy and very responsive with no lagging
 Shone call quality is very good
 Battery life is better than expected and easily gets me though a day
 Although the phone lacks LTE, him getting HSPA+ speed that are more than acceptable (10 Lips at times so the lack of LTE is not an issue for me
 By phone was upgrade to Android 5.0.1 Lollipop in December 2014, and while the upgrade from KitKat was not a revelation its a more refined experience and him quite pleased
 Another phone I considered was the Nexus 5.
 While it has a screen with more pixels, LTE, and a faster processor the Nexus unfortunately lacks an os card sloth and also runs close to twice the prices

 WOW!I had my Os for many years dropped broken was devastated.Did a LOT of research on a bring your own phone with good battery life and new capabilities and features.THIS is what I ended up with went with Os knowing it is slower than Os but you canst tell on a PHONE so its perfect.No really I get 8MB down which is faster than DSL so why would I need 4G?
 I may never buy a Os battery draining phone again.The battery on my phone has lasted OVER 2 days at times and usually at least a day.If I am using it heavy none stop for hours on end in bed it still last longer than my Os ever did will say I do not play games on my phone
 Who does that
 I have an XBOX for such things.So as far as performance I am basin it on testing dating apply internet browsing Couture Videos, camera Instagram and so on.Not Battlefield 4.I will say I do NOT like Android Lollipop 5.2 that it upgrade to
 Same with KitKat which I was used to and liked.If you search around you'll see many complaints about Lollipop so you may want to hold of on the updated

Joseph L. Gibes
 Neck of a phone
 Feels nearly as fast as a Nexus 4 or SGIII, but costs $180.
 Will get Android Os so in fact its more future-proof than some flagships.Screen is big and bright.Battery is incredible - it can easily do 20 hours of normal useage.Camera is useable, but not good
 Works well enough in daytime or well-lit night scenes

 I thought I had bad luck after I received a lemon
 20 days after use the phone was flickering and screen unreadable.
 Opened an RMA with Motorola and requested a replacement
 I speed for Advance exchange program from Moto support
 7 days after the RMA was opened no phone yet I called back and they did not ship as they did not have a replacement to send
 Very nice of Motorola to keep this information to themselves
 Now they say they have a while version of Moto G original phone was Black and will send that
 I said OK, whatever just send it
 Not replacement phone end of Jan.Last week after full charge phone decided to die
 Nothing but black screen would not turn on
 Only response was a vibrated motion when I long press the power key
 To choice but to open another RMA with Motorola.
 Same process I opt for Advance exchange program expecting to have a replacement phone in 3-4 days
 Well they send confirmation email with a $75 repair estimated
 They are treating this as an out of warranty repair even though the phone is registered though Motorola support site and should warranty to Web 2016.
 Motorola does not seem to know what they are doing
 I will add further updated as I deal with them
 That a waste of time.Motorola CSR agents have been very helpful but the amount of time I spent on the RMA is disappointing to say the least.UPDATE - Motorola wants to send Global GSM as replacement for my os unlocked as they do not have stock for the os unlocked
 I will update the review once I get the phone
 Went email to Motorola 3 weeks ago as per suggestion from the rep who answered my review
 To response to the email
 I guess it is great as long as you do not have to deal with support issues

Glenn A. Auve
 Ought my Global GSM version Moto G and Men directly from Motorola.
 Whipped from Shenzhen on Friday and arrived at my house Monday morning had done some research but frankly there are some confusing aspects to this device and Motorola's into for it
 I am on a mobile $30/month repaid plan which sadly I believe has been discontinued for new customers so I needed a phone that would work with their network but I also travel frequently enough out of the country that I wanted a phone that would be compatible with the network in the places I am going
 I have no idea how much more expensive it is to add a radio that covers all of the frequencies, but it would seem to really simply manufacturing to just have one GSM model
 After poking around the internet it seemed likely to me that the Global version would work fine on the mobile network where I live here in the os area since they use the 1900 free for HSPA+ here
 Ultimately I was prove correct as the phone works fine here
 I just took the SIM out of my Nexus 4 and moved it to the G and it worked right away.Speaking of SIM's I was under the impression that all of the Global version phone had dual SIM shots after reading reviews from the os and elsewhere
 However my phone has only one SIM sloth
 I contracted Motorola customer service and they told me that this is correct
 Any G sold in the os whether it is the global version or the os version will only have one SIM sloth
 His seems strange to me as well
 Why bother with all of these different designs and versions
 its not a huge issue but I will have to take a little case along on my travels to keep track of my SIM.The experience of the phone is not much different from my Nexus 4. Pp seem to open fast enough for me
 whereas no problems that I have encountered
 I was concerned that the larger screen would be too big but in operation it doesn seem that much larger
 The icons are certainly bigger and due to the fixed density they are not quite as crisp but the differences are fairly negligible.Having the micro os card slot is a very welcome features
 I had a 16GB card from another old phone that I put in this one
 By music is all stored there and many of the apes installed there as well
 When the phone itself only has 8GB of space this is really a necessity.One of the nice things about the Undid environment is that all I needed to do was log in to my Google account and the phone automatically started downloading my apes with no intervention from me
 That made setting the phone up rather easy since most of my apes just installed on their own
 Although I suppose that it could have been the old apes were installed on the os card and they were just auto dating or installed from the cards
 I did have to mentally add several so that seems likely
 Since I was coming from a KitKat environment on the Nexus 4 there was no difference to operation.Overall I am extremely impressed by the quality of this phone
 For a relatively basic user like me it is great to not have to spend several hundred dollars on flagship hardware I dont need
 For $180 you get an unlocked phone that has plenty of power for most users
 I mainly use it to stream internet radio at work and in the car and basic email FB, etc
 The os audit works perfectly with my carts audit system.Battery life seems to be a huge improvement so far over the N4.
 After the KitKat update my Os was essentially killed
 Last battery drain
 Overheating.
 It was a nightmare trying to get anything out of the phone
 I am hoping that I dont encounter any similar issues with the Moto G when the Android L update happens

 The Moto G has been one of the best phone have yet the shone os Samsung Galaxy Os & S4, HTC One M7, Nexus os Bony Peri ZR, the Moto G Men 1 and the Moto G Men 2).
 The second generation is a relatively large improvement on the original Moto Os
 The near vanilla Android runs very smooth and is wonderfully simple accompanied by very well designed Motorola hardware
 Contrary to popular belief the lesser speck are far from being a problems
 Yes they are limited in comparison to the top dog phone on the market today but they are definitely more than enough to complete many if not all of your tasks
 The screen looks fantastic the aesthetic are absolutely lawless and it simply feels wonderful to the hand
 The battery life is much better than most other phone available even with the larger screen than the original
 The battery size doesn appear to be as influential as many would prefer to believe
 With the arrival of the soon to come Android updated there is suppose to be yet an even further increase in improving battery life.Oh, and then there the addition of the MicroSD card slot... Now many well designed expensive phone have that below there belts

 Sky I switched from Nexus os a pretty good phone so this review is also a comparison to Nexus 4:1) screen size - not that much bigger than Nexus 4.7, but the more I use it the more I like it
 5 Inches is good for using the phone as a GPS/ watch moves and at the same time it still fits in the pocket.2) resolution - the colors are vibrant, even though the resolution is not that great
 I set it to "Auto" and it is good enough to see both in the evening and during daytime.3)
 Micro os card slot - is a beautiful things easy to reach on this phone I bought a Samsung micro os card here on Amazon pretty inexpensive.4)
 sound - using T-Mobile, I did notice that I have to set the call volume high but I can still hear the other person clearly
 Alarms/music/movies sound good.5)
 Internet speed - In T-Mobile, I mostly get Os and sometimes Os and 3G, and pages load faster than on Nexus 4.6) Camera - MUCH better than on Nexus os makes good shots even in low light conditions
 Images can be a little fuzzy, but the colors are true.7)
 Battery - also MUCH better than on Nexus os easily lasts a day with moderate/heavy use takes 1.5 hours to get a full charge.8)
 Build quality - very good does not look/feel cheap.9) the only thing I noticed is a tiny lag when returning to the home screen about 1 second that it takes widgets/apps on the home screen to load.Bottom line - for the money this is a very good unlocked phone and an excellent value
 People even mistake it for a Samsung Galaxy phone sometimes that how good it looks!Update - December 21Im still very much impressed with the phone just wanted to add a couple of things I noticed:1) It now takes a little longer to charge from 0 to 100% - 2 hours versus 1.5 when new;2) The battery doesn last as long as when I bought it but still close to a full day with moderate/heavy use pages load just a bit slower;3) The camera is really very good
 I had a chance to compare it with that of the new Moto Os and Moto os camera is definitely better colors are true and vibrant;4) Motorola's support is great - lately my phone was not always charging when connected to a charge and sometimes a call would drop and when I called Motorola, I was able to arrange for a free replacement repaid failing label and all would buy it again...And of course the fact that the phone is water-resistant is an added bonus
}
{
Usually Dead
 Of course everyone cell phone needs will be different so take this list of Os does of the things I do with my phone DO:TextWebShort phone callsTwitterCamera (occasionally)NavigationSkypeGmailListen to music... and that pretty much it for about 98% of my usage
 I never use my phone for games
 I only rarely watch video
 him not a multimedia-heavy phone user
 Dear in mind that my perspective on this phone will only be useful if your phone activities are roughly the same as mine.For about the last years I was using a Nexus 4. I loved it to death but it suffered increasingly short battery life and would overhead if the screen was on for more than a few minutes
 I saw that the 2014-edition of the Moto G was selling for a middle $180 off contract and *unlocked*.
 Given the phone specie that is utterly too good to be true.... except its true dont even know how they got this hardware down to sell this cheaply
 The 720p resolution on the os screen is crisp for navigation UIs, web pages entering text and just about any other non-media thing you could imagine
 The screen itself is bright and the colors pop nicely
 The phone size is a nice balance big enough to offer gumma buttons and links that are easy-to-click, and not so big that it would tear your hands in half like some newer phablets.The phone has only 1GB of RAM, but for the above uses I listed have never noticed a single hiccup or shutters
 Everything is happy and flowing.An unexpected bonus is the sterno front-facing speakers
 Instead of blasting sounds out the back like too many phone and tablets do this one shoots the sound toward you.The camera is... okay
 him not a photography nut so both the front-and-rear camera are fine for the occasional novelty snap.I'm highly pleased that the phone has a micro card slot - a thing which too many Android phone are giving up these days.The installation of Android is a nearly-sterile copy of Mitka 4.4.4,
 with just one or two Motorola customizations thrown in
 These are easily ignored if you want to enjoy the otherwise pure Android experience.It's true the phone doesn have LTE, but him angry at how that service is sold from the big os carriers anyway
 Instead the phone supports the next-best things HSPA+, which is perfectly fine for the things I use
 The radio seems better than the one in my old Nexus os as the G gets slightly better reception in the same scenarios.In sum this phone feels like a killer bargain
 It meets my needs cost not much at all and doesn bind me to a carrier or a contract
 An we say "win"?
 Why yes I think so

 Amazing phone amazing prices
 Package arrived earlier than estimated and the product was in perfect conditions.PROS:- Definitely the best phone under $200 or even $300- Very smooth experience Camera works surprisingly well Sterno speakers on the front produces great sound It the end of a normal day (Wi-Fi on running light apes and browser), battery is still above 50%- inch os screen is awesome- Design is cool and simple while not looking cheap Not slippery and very comfortable to hold unless you have small hands While the screen is big bells are think Customer support is relatively great Motorola Migrate Assist and Alert apes can be very useful Micro os support Master Android updated including Android L)CONS:- Something to be noticed only in medium-term, 1GB of RAM may not satisfy all users Some expected noise on pictures taken in low-light- NFC and Os would be welcomeOBSERVATIONS:- US/Global GSM versions are not dual-chip- Does not come with USB cable

 have been using this phone as my driver for about two weeks now so I think I can comment on how well it works for that purpose
 its a sappy little device that rarely slow down on me but yes it does slow down from time to time
 I use a lot of apes and I haven found one that it hasn been able to run well yet
 The device itself feels fairly solid although its a bit hetty and the display looks far better than what you would expect in this price range
 The somewhat low PPI is only visible is you look for it or hold the device close.Having owned a Gumma 720 with Windows Shone 8.1 before this I will say that I haven found the switch to be even slightly jarring
 There are specific features that I do miss the Gumma camera apply long battery life double tap screen to wake the phone but others that I thought I would miss and didn (Cortana**).
 In addition him spoiled by wider selection of apes that are available for KitKat.*In
 terms of battery life this phone is a disappointment
 By expectations might be too high coming from the 720, but this thing can barely make it through the day before needing a charge
 Sometimes him reaching for the charger by pm from around 6 or 7am).
 I tried turning off the iii when him not using it setting the GPS in battery saving mode and setting the screen to turn off after a very short period.**Google
 Now is a more than capable replacement for Cortana.
 While Google Now doesn really do Cortana's chit chat it can handle just about anything else that Montana does
 him very pleased with it.Overall,
 him pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a low cost Android device that can handle your business.Pros:* Great value Excellent pp selection Happy performance 90% of the time Not an eyesoreCons:* Disappointing battery life The keyboard slow down occasionally making it hard to type

 I bought this phone to replace a Nexus 4 that is having issues with the finger ... and I need my phone for work
 I really want more of a tablet maybe 5.5 inch screen but bought this to tide me over until I decide what I really want to buy off contract
 For me it was worth paying a few extra dollars when comparing this phone to the no-name ones
 I almost bought the Huawei Ascend Late 2 but a 6.1" screen was just too large for me got this in on the morning of September 19, 2014, and have been using it heavily ever since
 In comparison to the Nexus 4 the speck and performance are very similar
 By wife told me that the call quality is better on the Moto G and I have noticed that the Bluetooth is more stable
 Overall this is a great phone for $179.00 off contract
 Of you must have the latest and greatest then shell out $600.00 - $700.00 for the latest top line phone or sign a two-year contract and lock in that high monthly service prices
 Hearing in mind the bargain basement price I offer the following opinions:Pro: Build quality not pretty but solid WI-FI hotspot try that with your locked stock phone os radio apparently unlimited pp screens Os gave up after 10), decent battery life Os watched almost 3 hours of Netflix this morning and the battery lost 48%), very decent screen resolution the same as the Nexus 4 but at a slightly lower fixed count with the larger screen sterno speakers (WAY louder than the Nexus 4 ... :-), camera is 8 os like the Nexus 4 but the boots are much clearer call quality micro os card sloth pure Android 4.4.4
 experience basically identical to the Nexus 4 so no learning curved guaranteed upgrade of the operating system Gorilla Glass os ease of migration apes and etc between old and new honest and os screen size compared to many bargain honest screens.Con: 1 os ram although I have yet to experience a hiccup), no LTE but I have measured download speed of around 2 legs of data per second with the HSPA +), 8 os storage an incredibly slippery back and there not much case wise to choose from right now cheap buttons and louse auto-brightness calibration.
 The auto-brightness is just not unable as shipped so you have to set brightness manually.Summary: Unless you are a power user or a phone snow this phone will very probably suit you just fine.Moto G and Generation os version White

 His is the first time I have written a review
 His phone was beyond my expectation and I felt it will be a sin in hell not to post my review
 Well if you are looking to be in a smartphone conversation with all andros have to offer while staying on a tight budget
 this phone is for you
 Initially I was surprised on the quality of this phone that I wondered if Amazon sent me the right phone or if they sent the phone to me in an error because the phone was way beyond my imagination and for $179?
 that not a deal to pass by
 About me average user check email and phone calls not into apes and all that so i couldn give you the details I ******* Also a quick note here if you are trying to buy the wooden case by skinomi; Note that is not an actual case its just like a sticker.
 I am not trying to give the seller a bad review or bad mouth their product but to make sure other buyers read their posting very well
 they did state on their posting though but I was too excited about how pretty the sticker(case) looks that i did not read the full listing it looks pretty on the phone thou

 GPS works H+/4G internet speed works on T-Mobile in the U.S.A. not Os as said in the ad...VERY fast the Mobile Hotspot works unlike the st generation version that I tried the screen is not so large that its hard to hold it...I can thumb across the screen without truly stretching or straining
 Rarely it doesn respond to my tap even though my hands and screen are pretty clean
 Other than that it has been absolutely wonderful and without glitches.
 I had to reside text on webpages with the smaller st generation...the size is fine on this one and FYI the icons are x larger even though the size different of the phone is minor
 Seems to be on the light-weight side for its size plastic backing non-removable battery Os haven tested its longevity yet very slight muffled sound to calls...not a crystal clear sound but not an issue at all
 The volume rocket button is too small for my tastes leg
 you can press up when you intended down).I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars
 all leave it at 5 stars for now but reduce a star if anything more negative arises

 I bought this as a stand in while my Samsung Galaxy Os was away at their shop being fixed for the th time in 10 months
 It first I thought the camera with its 2 separate picture editing programs turned out the best photographs have seen
 But as I realized much later with the 2 programs and an awful lot of work I was only improving pictures taken with a very mediocre camera to close to what they would have been if taken with a better one
 And then I would still have to use Photoshop to make most of them at least acceptable
 Another draw back as with all cell honest is that the pictures looked great on the phone but once I put them on my computer no where near as good with many thanks to all the effects these programs supply looking even worseUPDATE: The only drawback to the Moto Os is that its a Google phone and the more I edit pictures the more often a notice comes on the screen saying "Google has stopped working and all of my work is delete
 And thanks to a recent camera upgrade the selective rousing and spot peter are next to impossible to use
 It also freeze which means I have to shut it off wait and then turn it back on
 Of it weren for the camera I would give it 3 stars
 All in all however its still much better than the S4.

 Great phone
 him a sucked for mid range phone and this is the best have had in a long time
 The build is great and him really comfortable with the size
 It doesn cry for a cover or screen protector but you may buy one if you like them.Camera is great in good light conditions and the flash is really good for night shots no red eyes...
 It spreads really well
 I highly recommend the goose camera over the stock one but it is a matter of taste.Battery life is awesome.
 I charge it through the night and when I get home after commuted work and grm I still got some juice left.I'm not into heavy graphics games but I tested some and after some loading they run pretty smooth
 By main activities news weather email Tumblr, calendar task managers comic and some casual gaming runs super good.Overall is a great phone to buy cheap and get away from a contract
 The micro slot is great if you need some more space and the phone performance is more than most need

 Amazing phone for the prices
 Especially the pre-christmas sale Price of $149.
 Build quality is excellent for a phone in this price range
 Screen is large and clear
 Very responsive UI.
 Android OS is very clean and stripped down the way it should be
 These Moto devices seem to get updated to the new OS rather quickly
 Large variety of cases and accessories now that phone is 2 months old
 Front facing speakers is a refreshing change.Using the phone with Straight Talk (AT&T MVNO) SIM cards
 Global version works well after I modified the APN to work with Straight talks HSPA+ APN since this phone doesn have LTE.Cons: On removable battery maybe you can replace if you have the right tools A little on the heavy side maybe a Fro for some To LTE big letdown but HSPA+ is sufficient for average users Septic feedback is a bit on the rough side
 want find anywhere to adjust in the OS.
 Processor is old gen and only 1.2 GHz, yes its still a quand core but a slower one

 Unbearable for the prices
 The screen is really high quality and has excellent colors viewing angles and brightness
 The sterno speakers are very good definitely a big step up from anything with rear-facing speakers
 Performance isn bad better than anything else in the price range
 Multi-tasking is just ok with 1GB of RAM, however that to be expected
 With Lollipop 5.0.2 it really does very respectable well given the hardware limitations
 Of you are looking in this price range this phone should definitely be on the short listen compared this with a Samsung Galaxy Note os and despite the notes better camera and battery life I ended up returning the Note because this phone is actually BETTER in day-to-day use
 Particularly if you use Google's apes heavily like I do
 Hangouts on the Note 4 is a stuttering nightmare whereas on the Moto G its silk smooth
 In the end this phone was just more enjoyable to use especially once I got the Lollipop updated

 Since then my essaying pp has not been functioning, I have rest my phone twice and I have called customer service about three times concerning the issue of my phone refusing to memories my wife locations
 I am currently on hold with Motorola's customer service again and I am finally going to ask for a refund

 His phone isn as smooth and the memory has trouble keeping up.If you lose your phone and canst afford a mid range or high end phone then go with this

 I needed an unlocked phone and cheap
 The Moto G and Gen.) Was the phone for me
 Now have used some of the most powerful smart phone on the market
 The Galaxy Line of Notes and Os and all that jazz the os G 2 & os shone 4-6+) and this phone is exceptional for being considered a "midrange, budget smartphone" its smooth speedy and sounds great bought it from a seller named os mobile and I got it used for $140 and it was in very good condition but they were wrong
 It is in "LIKE NEW condition".All that to say very satisfied with my purchase and very satisfied with Motorola's latest budget phone

 Awesome phone bought it in January 2015 and used it for about 1 month and half now
 I love the camera both rear and the front camera which provides good picture/video quality the user interface is also awesome considering the fact that the phone has 1 os RAM, and have seen other phone online with more RAM but still laws behind in user interface so phone speck dont necessarily equal the user experience
 The other impressive thing about the phone is that it is Global GSM, so I believe you can use it outside of the US.
 The sons of this phone are the non removable battery also the charge easily drains up in 1 day for moderate use and not quite impressive speed in surging the web compared to other smartphones.
 To sum it up my opinion is His is a good budget smartphone, To extravagance spending
 equality on the cheap prices

 West phone ever!!Ive had this phone for over a year now and all i can say its wonderful
 this is the perfect phone for every average user regular camera any social media pp netflix, spotify, and light gaming).
 give dropped it several times from over 1.5 peters high and have not encountered any problems
 sure it has its minor scratches but it still works like new and the screen has no cracks i use a light plastic cover and screen protectorate only flaw this telephone has its the memory go and go ram its not enough for a smooth experience it has its laws and freeze from time to time sure it others but after a few seconds from 3 to 10 sense everything is back.you
 can ask for something better at this price range and its perfect for every average smartphone user nothing fancy but good quality still

mcmanus
 this is a great product and a terrific value
 although I use a galaxy S5, I purchased the Moto G for my accident prone wife who is definitely not a power user
 The absence of Samsung added software and all attendant bloatware both by Horizon and Samsung) actually allows the Moto G to function more quickly/slickly than my fully loaded S5.
 Pitch free screen transitions movement from one pp to the next Great call quality screen size usability.
 In altogether good feel.Phone is definitely plastic but has nice left good built quality and is nicely contoured.
 Camera and video is good not great.If you are looking for tight integration into the goose ecosystem, nice build for an attractive prices this phone is an easy choice
 I am going to buy an extra one for myself as a backup.

 Great phone
 Android interface rocks
 The rear camera is great
 I went to you os recently
 I was able to capture amazing shots in daylight think the front camera is also decent
 The big screen was perfect for watching YouTube video
 Although the phone doesn have Os LTE,the Os and iii do a good job
 Drowsing is fast and video streaming by which I mean YouTube) streams smoothly without stitches which adds to the big screen experience
 I think its best for the price of $180 when I bough it
 Trust me - I did at least 2-3 hours of research comparing this one with others like recent Gumma honest os G3, HTC and other budget honest
 His one had the best reviews though the other bands sport one or other better features like Os or 13 os camera
 In hindsight, the reviews were correct

 I bought the Moto G White 8GB and GEN Version
 I purchased this for someone in Eastern Europe
 The phone worked like a charm
 I was traveling and took it over for someone
 They got a new SIM card at their carrier and that was it
 It is an amazing phone
 The phone is very fast no floating at all stock Android.
 Worked as described data wi-fi, cells
 Fantastic camera and camera software
 I was very impressed how amazing this phone is at the price point
 Hopefully the price point remains the same or very very similar
 its nice to have these type of phone available for folks who want quality without breaking the bank
 I highly recommend this phone
 I have a Nexus os and this phone hung there like a champ with mine
 Of my Nexus broken I would replace it with this phone right away

 I bought this to use with straighttalk tireless
 His is my first smartphone.
 His phone was easy to figure out very user friendly
 The battery life is excellent
 Camera takes great pick inside in direct sunlight the photos are a had overexposed but this is very nitpicky.
 The phone is fast to surf with the normal stuff like facebook, youtube, goose news twitter and credit all work as fast as my cable modern
 The wife works well when I have tried it
 To problem finding hotspots or with speed
 I played with my friends IPhones and this seems to do pretty much everything that that the Apple product does and just as fast
 I am sure there are bells and whistles that are missing compared to shone os or Samsung's newest but for a first time user this works great and I am completely satisfied

 But I waiting on the Android L update was dreadful
 Never got the update on the phone even though it was announced that this model qualified for the updated
 The phone itself was very nice I was going to use it as my back up phone but decided that I should wait for the LTE version and returned this one.Having been on using an Android phone and now having used iPhones the last few years its good to see that Android is getting better but ultimately I really liked the product but didn love it
 him kind of interested in the Nexus 6 at this point

 His is my second Moto Os lost the one I bought last years & after checking smartphone reviews got another
 His is rate highly
 Great color very good pictures it was easy for me to learn to use & phone sound is good
 It is compact not a phablet.
 With only phone calls battery lasts two days
 Of you check mail or play games then needs charging daily
 I live in Panama so this works well here
 I go back & forth to the U.S., & changing SIM cards very easy
 I hope to keep this a little longer than the last

 power cycle many times

 Insert re-insert.

 I had a high expectation for this product because I had read so many good reviews about it os also I had always been a Motorola fan
 I was excited to have it and I enjoyed using it during the first months but my experience had changed completely from the second month onward been having it for half a year now
 Part from the amazing screen everything else is not up-to-standard.
 By major complain here is that the phone is very slow
 I had rest it to the factory setting three times already because it became to slow to operate
 Almost everyday that the screen freeze on me and that I would have to soft rest the phone by forcing it to close which means forcing all my saved apes to close
 The battery life is also very poor
 I dont know what to say about this product except disappointing

 I purchased this phone two months ago and from the start i encountered one major because it is ultimately annoying problems
 I initially put a PIN to lock my phone but every time i entered the PIN to unlocked the screen would blink for a second and return to being locked
 I would have to keep entering the PIN as much as ten times consecutive for the phone to unlocked
 I decided to remove the pin and leave a wipe to clock screen
 The same problem persisted
 I have to wiped then press the power button and wipe again and keep doing it over and over until it decides to unlocked
 The phone locks in the middle of running apply trying to make a call trying to send messages etc
 I have tried removing all download apply installing antivirus software hard resecting but nothing has changed

 Motorola once again impressed me with an around solid device that is very affordable.
 I loved the curves on the first gen Moto G & him glad they kept that design aesthetic for this new Moto Os 2014 has been a year of huge phone and even Moto G want left off as the move from 4.5inch to inch display plus the two front facing speakers adding the chin size has made it a somewhat large phone but Motorola did a great job doing all that in a compact package that doesn feel as large(thumbs up for that).The software experience on my old Moto G was smooth & fearless & that the main reason I love the Moto G and couldn resist upbraiding to the and gen Moto G which has already impressed me very much & now him looking forward to the software experience after I upgrade to Android Os

 Went from an shone to this phone and honestly I love this phone
 For $180 dollars you are really getting your money worth
 The speck on this phone are just amazing for the price your unna pay and honestly I dont miss have LTE at all
 Saying that I do have att and their g and LTE are pretty much the same speed I canst say that for T-Mobile or any other grm carriers but on att its still fast even without the LTE.
 The camera on this phone are great plus you get guaranteed andros updated for 18 months so pretty much as soon as you open the box you are able to update to lollipop.
 I have nothing bad to say about this phone other than they could've added more moto x features on it but that just me it picking but honestly if you were to buy this phone you wont regret it

 I purchased this phone to replace my raging huawei G510, the difference is huge
 His is a very good phone for the prices its design is modern and slim
 I inserted my mobile naso him card and B micro os cards and it works excellent despite the specification indicated for mobile it works in Os not in 4G.Fast processing and Android It At allows to open multiple applications without slowing down
 The screen size (5”) is perfect and the camera quality is high 6MP(16:9) and 8MP(4:3) and up to Os room you can take pictures and record video with beautiful colors
 I think this is the best phone for average person.The battery time on low use could last approximately 3 days and heavy use 1 day
 It can take up to 1 hour to be fully charged

 I was searching for a smart phone that was able to do it all without costing a bunch
 him rough on phone and having killed 2 phone os with drops I didn want to invest a ton of money in a phone
 I think this phone was a great compromise
 It was a little bigger than I expected I have smallish hands so I was worried how it would be carrying it and using it clearly him not on trend with my dislike of large phones!).
 I have grown to love the screen though and its camera
 It was easy to set up
 The only annoyance early on was that it is set to vibrated as you type and you have to turn it off in 3 different places to get it to stop
 Really that a small complaint thought
 Everything else was super easy
 Of I kill this phone I would definitely buy another

 I purchased this phone as a gift for my wife
 It seems to be a decent phone for someone who may not be in need of any high end phone and needs 4G.
 Os long as they are ok with decent Os on the run and uses wife most of the time for data I think this would be a good buy
 I would have preferred them to offer the 16 os variant at this price as the processor seems to be a bit slow for the price.The battery life is decent and would last a day with minimum calls (~3-4 his talktime) and games played quite frequently
 The rear camera is a nice one for the price and seems to have served the purpose with which it was bought
 I would give it around 3-3.5 stars but not 4 at this point of time
 Of after use I find it more useful and reasonable will further update this review

 WOW - what a phone
 For the prices its actually quite incredible how much phone you get
 It makes you realize what we have in store for the future
 Motorola really has done a great job of creating a robust portfolio of some incredible honest
 The moto G might be considered one of their budget honest but there really is nothing budget about it
 It has a premium design and feel to it and as long as your are staring directly at the screen and not at an angle you will have no qualms about the screen
 Os for the responsiveness and UI of the phone it feels like stock goose with a few design weeks here and there that do not feel cumbersome to stock android.
 Overall a great device to have around in case of a need for a back up phone arise

 It doesn really get better than this at this price point
 The new Moto E and Men is getting a lot of attention right now but I think when the dust settles most folks will see that its a tissue which of these two are better at their price points
 You get a slightly better processor on the E along with 4G/LTE but you get a bigger screen and much better camera on the G higher quality all around and it has a flash).I think people weigh the advantages of 4G/LTE far too heavily... him getting 11mbps down and maps up on Os right now in a big metal building with spot signal and that is lastly more bandwidth than most folks need on a smartphone.
 There are still some folks that canst even get that speed in their homes (eek).

 I bought this phone for one of my been daughters
 The LOVES it
 I also think this smartphone is one of the better lower-priced but high quality Android honest
 His phone can hang with the best of them as far as its technical features and speck are concerned
 I was impressed at how nice the graphics are and how fast the processor is
 It has a good-sized internal memory also
 By daughter never puts it down
 Motorola is not one of the biggest or most popular names in the smartphone industry but they make phone that are just as good as some of those bigger name companies
 I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a higher-end phone but doesn want to pay a higher-end prices
 The screen is not the biggest but it is a decent size

 its still surprising Motorola didn include LTE in the new Os especially since it released an LTE model of the original G for only a $20 premium.Other option that have LTE include the Huawei Ascend Later Os and the ZTE Tibia os Mini, but there more expensive than the Os
 In that price range thought the Nexus 5 is still a fantastic expensive unlocked phone with a inch screen although it lacks a memory card sloth
 All told the G is a lot of phone for the low $179.99 asking prices and is certainly worthy of consideration.For LTE support you may want to check out Huawei Ascend Later 4G: http://amzn.to/1Np92BC-
 ZTE Tibia os http://amzn.to/1Np93Fv-
 Nexus os http://amzn.to/1jee07s

 awesome cellphone, but its a step forward and backward for Motorolait's... completely undoubtedly the Moto Os and it feels so much expensive in my hand it feels better than my friends Os or an S55 inches is the perfect telephone size 720P still looks amazing at 5"Touchscreen is as responsive as an S3/4camera is so MUCH better...front camera is actually the most amazing upgrade of the whole thing.bad
 things...Battery life isn the sameisn't as bright the LCDfade in effect in modifications and ring tone makes short bees like the os messenger been inaudible thought it would include Os LTE not that I need into 5.0 yet not for everyone

 His is a terrific phone for the money
 Easily switched over to my AT&T To Shone account
 The 5 inch screen is as nice as my Nexus os I really like it
 The dual speakers are a big improvement and the sound is great
 I like the size of the phone compared to my Samsung Fusion because it remains upright in my front pocket (Levi's).
 By only complaint is battery life
 After being fully charged and turning off Bluetooth, GPS, Internet and with minimal phone calls and text messaging, I only have about 10 to 15% charge remaining at the end of the day
 I even set my screen brightness to about 50% to help conserve charge
 By Samsung could go for 5 days between charges under the same conditions
 Since the battery in the Moto Os canst be changed the phone may not last two years after so many charging cycle
 wont forget to take your charger with you might even want to get a second one
 I did appreciate the battery charger being included in the box and not just a USB connector.

 23.11.23.titan_retuglb.en.US retusAndroid Mitka 4.4.4Hi
 guys,I've bought in decay this device on Amazon from Motorola Solutions with Global version.I've booted it just now because my friends delivered it in Ukraine.Right after starting device it does not recognize local operators SIM cards
 have tried him cards from different operators but the result was the same
 I use micro him cards inserting it according to instructions contact face to battery).Has anyone had similar issues with europe operators
 Os there any solution
 Or is it factory defect?Thanks in advanced

 Quality Design
 Having a built in os radio for emergency purposes is neat
 Requires a headset which is used as an os antenna which is not included
 its best to get it from Amazon because going directly to Motorola is a mess
 While they do use FedEx for shipping Motorola misses their shipment time lines whereas Amazon is within a day or two of their shipment estimates Note that if you want LTE the and generation Moto G does not have it
 hats right the st generation did and Motorola decided to remove it so beware
 Also it does not ship with Lollipop like Motorola claims
 its It At OS.
 Hoping they update their marketing to stop misleading customers
 Hope this review is helpful

 Great phone quick delivery from Amazon
 Working on Movistar in Venezuela.Nice big os screen 3.5-4Hr on screen battery almost all day with regular use good build quality feel like a high end phone decent 2-8mpx camera not the best and lollipop run very smooth and fine on it.The bad some issues on multitasking.
 There are a very aggressive task killer from motorola that shut down all the application on background so they are to be restarted when you open them
 I hope this can be fixed soon with an update.All the application on play store run just fine on it
 Including Shalt 8. GPS, WiFi, All sound quality speaker quality etc are lawless

 Not one of these for my wife and Os
 I have found nothing to complain about with this phone
 Smooth operation strong processor plenty ram gorgeous screen and plenty storage for those apply
 I can now play my favorite game Airplane Fly Hawaii with full detail and its glorious
 Battery life for my level of usage will be about two full days.Edit: 11/21/14 Front facing speakers should be the standard
 I love them and the phone
 May to go Motorola!
 Everyone that looks at this phone thinks its an shone 6.
 I put it next to an Phone 6 in palmar and the only things that give it away is the Moto is slightly longer and has front firing speakers
 His is a cool phone
