 the moto g has all normal smart features and good to grip utilitarian design
 the design could however be more appealing with rich black looks , had the twin speaker bars on both sides stop / bottom could be concealed to improve aesthetic value of the gadgat.... Overall good , if offered with better battery life....

 That you want in a phone of value 12999/- , a Camera os Screen Good RAM, Letter Processor Speakers
 To my answer you'll get these all in one your answer is MOTO Os , You are getting Snapdragon processors Squad Core), with great GPU, 1 os RAM, 16 os Internal memory
 my first hand experience as i opened the box and switch on the phone i was asked to update my phone in Android 5.0.2, so first experience to me was awesome, it has great screen with great color production gorilla glass 3 so no scratches then great sterno speakers awesome quality
 James running smoothly
 even Shalt and NOVA os memory is 16 go so no issues in storage also you can install unto 64 os card as well
 All quality is better than any other phone its really loud
 To overall I can say I am totally satisfied with the Product Motorola has made and finally thanks to flipkart as well to providing this great service

 bought the phone on January and and it is with feb and i am onto my second replacement model
 the first time the power button stopped working within a week and a half and flipkart was nice enough to replace the phone within a day
 Now it is two weeks since i used the replacement phone and the phone has stopped charging altogether
 While flipkart has provided me with a replacement instantly and I should get the replacement tomorrow i am having serious doubts over motorola's product quality
 Understand that this is not a very expensive phone but having two failures within a month of the original purchase makes me wonder
 Buyer beware

 Initially There was a big buzz for this phone
 People told MOTO G is Superb...
 But i had a different experience
 It started after dating to lollipop..
 It hangs a lot even having a average apply
 He can answer the call and give text reply when the phone is in locked
 But it entirely different
 He can see who is calling we have press the power button put password then only we can attend the call
 2.The GPS is worst
 It will show my location in some where else
 Now get directions will be always wrong direction".. one ratification remains in display for more than 10 seconds even i tried to wipe off it is not working
 Pp stuck like anything.... Sometimes answer option will not work
 The screen stuck when I wipe the apes pages
 ZERO STAR......

 I got the phone with Android Lollipop pre installed

 In every aspect the phone is decent....even in the weaker zone it scores 3.5/5....best phone at this prices
 the 5'' screen is good not very big easy to handle....very light and slim feels good in your hand
 The battery back up not as good as the previous moto g 1....as battery back up reduces with increase screen size...but over all decent
 very fast
 16 os storage is an added advantage
 The lollipop update is already available...if u dint want to wait till may 2015 and desperate to use andros lollipop and Nexus is beyond your budget ...go for it

 I am always a fan of MOTOROLA for the last 10 years...This Moto G is very impressive on look performance and prices
 The gorilla screen is superb you dont have to use screen guards
 The battery life is good
 The most important thing I love about all MOTO phone is the sound clarity its brilliant
 Love it use it to feel the punch...!!!

Santoshkumar D...
 I am writing this review after 15 days of use
 I purchased from FlipKart and as usual the delivery was great
 Moto G has all the features one can think off at this prize range 1 os RAM works fine along with a pretty good processor speed
 Android Lollipop update did not find any lag as mentioned by few of the reviewers.
 Battery could have been better
 It comes only for a day and surprisingly charging is too slow with the charger available with the phone
 You may need to get a power bank for quick charge
 It has a great look but slightly bulkier with the MOTO cover pretty expensive only the light magnetic senior is the advantage you can do away with the cover
 Must the next day of my purchase the cover prize was reduced from 1700 to 1179 for royal blue
 Screen is real with a scratch resistant LCD glass
 I did not find any difference with AMOLED and this staff after using it
 Sunlight reliability is very good
 Two him shots are nicely planned along with the dual speakers at the front
 But be careful about the dust accumulation inside the speakers
 Repeatedly you have to wipe it off
 All the built applications and playstore makes it easier to download the application
 Voice clarity and other stuffs are good
 Signal response is very good here even being a dual SIM Mobile
 His has been the basic problem with most of the dual SIM mobile
 To ensure two SIMS are used actively in these mobile
 I had a serious problem with signal response in my earlier purchased Foka 730 which I had returned to flipkart after 20 days of use
 Flipkart kindly accepted the fact and obliged the return
 Money was refused to my wallet
 When I came to know that Foka 730 has serious problem of call drop due to poor signal response
 His is happening for Foka 535 also which my colleges have purchased
 I am not comparing here the Foka 730 with Moto G2, but there is some problem in the former
 However battery of 730 way better than Moto G2.
 To conclude there are more ports and less sons in Moto G which is the best bet to go in the present changing scenario of the mobile and keeping the overall budget in mind
 Of the budget is within 15000 its a best bet
 By rating would be 4 out of 5.
 It loose one star because of the battery

 Especially the speed and display
 its missing some features thought
 Things like u cannot use phone speakers while using radio it does not have in built file manager and sound recorder
 obviously they can be download and installed

 Although I am using single SIM. os Display is good Sons ====== os Camera is not good

 West hands for the prices runs latest android, however dont let it fool you
 There are better option out there if you got extra cash
 Con's:- 1. Always defective handiest sent first
 After you order I guess there is procedure Flipkart follows Firstly send a defective or returned product to the customers Of customer realise the defect then avoid return fetch support i guess is trained to avoid returns as much as possible Wont accept for a return until customer pushes this matter to the consumer court End the proper phone
 2. Never ever Directly Lift this phone to anyone make sure u check it and proceed
 3. The earphones which comes with this hands are meant for conversations NOT music
 4. Currently Lollipop has stability Issue's.

 I use Moto G and have recommended it to everyone
 Fact I bought 5 of them now through Flipkart.
 The Operation of Moto G is is also phenomena .
 Its has the same awesome battery
 The camera which was lagging in the st Men has been taken care of Os wont say its perfect but yes its better
 The Lollypop has been updated in all of the Moto os which is before any other brand except Google itself
 I dont have any sons for this particular products
 Motorola had failed it and everyone knows it

 I am reviewing this after two month of my usage ordered the phone on th Dec around 7PM and it is delivered on th Dec at 2 PM.Thanks to flipkart.
 Now coming to the specifications:- Camera/video recording - Excellent,recording is @720p .
 Speakers - moderate sound
 Battery - Good but if U surf or play games too much battery consumption is very high Part from all the functionality i got the Lollipop update at the end of January.. Totally worth it..I suggest others to buy this... os
}
{
Prem Prakash
 every thing is good about this phone except for battery life
 Of your are a heavy camera
 you donna charge it 3 times a day
 but on normal usage it lasts for about 20 his
 Its video recording seems to have a problems
 It bump suddenly from bright to dark video recording and this continues if lighting conditions vary very rapidly
 like if you move your camera very much then it will surely happen
 Good thing is the moment you are connected to internet it receives andros lollipop OTA updated
 Cry to switch off captive brightness and mentally increase the brightness a bit so that its visibly clearer
 try to buy a good os EAR earphones because the earphone that comes with it is old fashioned
 Also buy OTG and USB cable because its not provided here
 After upbraiding to lollipop if you see exclamation mark (!) inside a triangle in the ratification panel saying restricted access then remember that you will still be using your him perfectly but this usually happens if you cut out normal him into micro him instead of purchasing a brand new micro him
 Also it happens if you use naso him with adapted
 To try to buy a new micro him and dont cut old him normal him to micro him Also remember that both the him when inserted will click and then lock into position
 Not just insert him and leave it without hearing a click sound
 And USB OTG is fully supported
 os its a video or image or music then just go to gallery and you will find it
 For all other file types just install "FILE COMMANDER" from goose play stores
 Not increase sound to full volume on front speakers as it will produce a chattering noise at that high level
 HTC phone front sterno speakers are way ahead and advanced in this category so dont compare it with that
 but overall build quality is smooth and seems branded
 its value for money
 and you can play all high end games like modern combat os shalt os real racing 3 etc
 But remember that its suffer memory is pretty low so dont expect to resume game if you are multi taking
 Once you are out of game in pause mode then when you return you will see the game has restarted
 Good thing is that it doesn get heated up no matter what game you play how much time you play
 Must try not to play game during charging
 Os this will increase your overall battery life
 And remember that battery is fixed as phone is water proof
 if any thing happens to you battery then just go to motorola service center and they will change it for you
 Not open your phone and remove any of internal components or even battery as there is a naso coating
 Of you expose any of terminal then your phone will not be water proof
 And believe me Its totally water proof
 I have dropped my phone in a bucket full of water it drowned but still it is working like a charm
 i suggest it to every one
 one last things if you see exclamation mark (!) beside wife or network symbol on top after upbraiding to lollipop then dont be afraid its just because of signal strength
 you can still be able to use it normally

 Gros : 1. Good screen resolution 2. Was first to get Lollipop update 3. Size is just right and feels sturdy in hand ( Plunged on a costly lip cover 4. battery gets you through the day and charges quickly 5. Dual him 6. os card flexibility Sons 1. Camera sucks ( os in outdoor poor in indoors
 Complicated room procedure
 2.
 Not full os 3. Screen shot procedure of holding two button works sometimes and fails sometime Overall a good budget phone with which you can spend a year ( if you like to change mobile often - 2 to 3 years if you are not finicky.

 Good build quality
 Lollipop update came in no time
 But the phone heat up quickly when Os is ON.
 Its like you can feel the heat in your hands when you are holding it
 Since its shares the same configuration as the same old Moto-G st Men phone except for the bigger display battery back goes for a toss here
 Very night I have to charge it for sure
 Part from these I love the phone
 North the money

 His is not a product review
 His is the review of worst Motorola service
 I have bought Moto E on the day of launch
 After 2 months it started showing issues with speaker
 Have it to authorized service center in Kochi, ADR Technologies.
 They took 1.5 months to repair it
 But after 1 hour of usage it started showing the same issue
 Again I gave it to the service center
 Will now I have visited the service center 12 times it is 45 Ms away from my home
 But still they could not repair it
 Service center people said they have done everything possible
 When I asked for the replacement they said they are not getting approval from Motorola and asked me to contact Manikandan, regional manager of Motorola.
 For the last 3 months I have been calling so called regional manager Manikandan for the replacement
 All these days he was telling me stories like no stock not getting approval etc It least he used to pick my calls but did nothing
 Now he stopped picking my calls
 It looks like I have to go to consumer court to get it replaced
 His is my experience with Motorola.
 os BUY os YOUR RISK !!!
 I have bought 3 Motorola handiest through Flipkart, Moto Os Moto G 2 & Moto Os
 I have put the same rating and review for all these as I am reviewing after sales service of Motorola not the products

 I happened to have the phone in my front jeans pocket all the time
 I had a small said from my bike and am damn sure that didn impact my phone in anyway
 But after the fall my phone left side touch started to work itchy and i have a very small lcd crack on my lower left screen which begins to lengthen using day to day
 Service center says you shouldn keep the phone in Means and all
 Not covered in warranty due to external damaged
 Pretty lame reason for a reputed company
 And for a new screen they are charging pretty much the cost of the phone
 Not to mention the battery backup.
 Why is that the after sales ONLY os INDIA sucks

 Motorolla phone are quite good in function and battery life compared to Samsung galaxys..
 Only issues with this phone is like Samsung phone it doesn have hardware navigation keys at the bottom only software keys)... which becomes an issue with the overall size of the display as the phone uses a lot of space in the bottom for the software keys especially in a web brother pp you screen strolling size goes small
 You can install Autohide softness pp for this... Overall phone battery comes for almost a day and half of regular using mine was rooted though with lots of apes and running widgets) so for the normal user it should last 2 days... Clash is like samson bright led To good fixed battery should sell the phone in a year after warranty else battery cost will be high for replacement as it is fixed...

 I bought this phone very recently after a long search
 the moment i opened it it showed me update for andros Os that was a bang on Before andros L update phone battery was awesome but after its up-gradation it gets discharge very easily but the good point is also that it get charged very fast
 over all phone performance from its UI, camera sound quality to features like moto assist and all attracts a lot but you have to compromise its battery life once it gets upgrade to andros Os otherwise this phone is awesome , a big thumbs up os

 Hittel is asking to wait for 72 hours again after every 72 hours are over and giving illogical reason like - I put SIM after removing from Moto G mobile to Samsung Galaxy Y which I exchanged on flipkart) To I can NOT have Moto G mobile and Samsung Galaxy Y together
 then how can I put SIM in Samsung Galaxy Y after removing from Moto G!!!.
 Flipkart on other side is simply asking to wait again and again
 It is now almost ONE MONTH over waiting
 But no result

 there is no excavation system in flipkart and agent keeps repeating the same story that we dont have authority for replacement and you would get call from them ... it really frustrating.
 dont buy products from flipkart else you may also have to run around to get the right product or service from them

 Moto G is a great phone especially with respect to its very competitive pricking
 The phone is fast and responsive
 By only issue with this phone is mainly with Android.
 Android is now tied very closely to Google and there is no escaping goose on this phone
 To way to not link your phone to google, and share all your information
 The recent Lollypop update has made the slower and the UI is not very good
 There are several limitations in using this new design for example the phone application and finding contact requires several more task
 I preferred the KitKat UI.
 I would recommend the users to wait for a little for dating their phone while until Lollypop achieved more maturity
 Please note There is no easy way to revert back to Mitka once updated

 Well this is a an updated review after ... Firstly phone is excellent and true to all the claims
 Must an foi for pp out there....latest lollipop update is a massive battery drained !!! Had bought this phone fr my dad who was very very happy with it until recently when i upgrade to lollipop os earlier he would need charging after more than 24 his from full charge hang like 30-36hrs with his limited usage but with mail & other background apes syncing).
 Now it wont even last properly for like 16 his from full charge
 no changes at all as far as new apes installed or something but the battery drain if is substantially more !!!! Please note am not saying the phone is faulty or something....just as a heads up for pp who might not have upgrade to lollipop to take this into consideration os And have read up online that lollipop does have these issues irrespective of the phones...so, it explains a lot os All in all the phone is a value for money with nice features in my opinion os Would def recommend buying...

 I have used the product... Will now had a great experience and with the lollipop update the experience is amazing
 Moto G and Men checks all the portions required for a good smart phone
 With its inch is display 2.2GHz processor Gaming and Aching Bodies is so smooth
 And with its 16GB ROM apes run smoother
 The new lollipop update gave a great new look an enhanced the performance of multi taking
 But the James and Video run smoother on Mitka in
 Android 4.4.4.
 Hats why waiting for 5.1 updated
 In all u should buy this because at this amazing price till now any smart phone gave these many features

 His is the very worst mobile that i have seen in the past 10 years
 There was no proper battery back up
 Starts very often and suddenly shows the charging as 0%.
 Of the mobile gets shut down by draining the battery then need to struggle for least two or three hours to get it started again
 Not all happy with the mobile
 Cried for replacement with in one month of purchase and the customer care people told to start and rest the phone and rejected my replacement request
 By dear friends please do not go for this mobile

 I bought this for my mother some time back and it stopped working after some time rather than reaching out to Flipkart we went to the service centre of Motorola which said we would need to replace the motherboard that would cost 7000 rupees.
 They refused to give this to us in writing
 He tried reaching out to Motorola on email Twitter and they haven responded till now
 In all this the 30 day replacement duration passed
 were still stuck with this slab of rocky
 Buy this phone at your own risk if it stops its gone for good

 The phone is very good in comparison to the price that you are paying for it
 But there is an issues that has come into my noticed
 His might sound funny but the screen display quality for the hands is different for the white set and the black
 Well I noticed it after I updated my phone to the latest version of andros (lollipop 5.0.2).
 Soon after the upgrade the screen brightness of my hands black visibly reduced
 His was not the case for the white handiest although the hardware configuration for both the device is the same
 There are many colleague of mine who are using moto go and most of them have white devices
 When I compared my screen display quality to theirs it was quite dull
 But when I compared it to a black hands it was the same
 Wounds weird but true
 I have asked for a replacement a black set again so lets see if it has the same issue

 I purchased this device on must February from Flipkart, and the day i got the device the OTA for andros lolipop was launched and i didn even use stock mitka on the device and updated the phone
 I was damn excited about the device
 But disappointment that the device started hanging .
 I dont know if it was because of the updated
 But after about 2 weeks of use i was fed up with the speed and asked flipkart for the replacement
 And I am so happy that without asking any silly questions flipkart sent me a replacement immediately :D, and guess what the device i got works fine and even after upgrade to andros lolipop its fast os To maybe a defect in the old device
 It was a pleasure to shop on flipkart.
 By next purchase is the Moto 360 Os

Krishnadass
 I had ordered Moto G and Men last Friday
 The product received was defective touch screen not working
 I called up customer care within 2 hours of receiving the product and asked for a replacement
 I was surprised to hear that the delivery status has not yet been updated in their system and hence I need to wait
 The wait never ended even after 4 days 6-7 phone calls and 6-7 email to the customer care
 Even as I write this review I have not got my replacement phone os Now can Flipkart sell such poor quality products
 And how can they take customers for granted after collecting the money not even taking the request for replacement for 4 days after customer informing them about the defect os I will think 100 times before deciding to purchase an electronic device from Flipkart in future

Anikash Chakra...
 I have been using this phone for the past 2 weeks and it works fine like butter
 Maybe some battery issue as it has a low battery backup.
 But overall it is an amazing piece
 With the support of Google you get the latest updated faster than any one
 The 1 os RAM is sufficient for multi-tasking and there can be a lag of 0.1 see but you need not worry about that
 Round quality is amazing and provides you true surround sound
 Simple smooth and efficient
 I think you should go for it
 Moto has been revolutionized!
 Keeps its a good device with excellent features

Sudip Chatterjee
 Have been using this amazing device for a month now
 The filpkart delivery was amazing got it in a day without outing the in a delivery option that too with a Rs.1200 lip cover absolutely free with it
 Now coming on the phone performance its amazingly built with strong exterior design which is very stylish
 The resolution and display is very vivid n sharp and strong hardware
 Despite of its 1GB RAM its performance never laws as it does in most of the samson handsets.
 Must say i was facing a few issues in my devices performance in some sector because of the latest Android Lollypop update which on calling Moto India helping was immediately resolved
 Personally i liked the mitka version because of the transparent black background in menu which turns white in lollypop update & its not changeble.
 The most important issue or should i say the major con of this device is its battery
 The former st gen moto g had the same 2070 may battery which the phonemaker should have increased but unfortunately it did'nt.
 To the battery lasts for a closely fair 1 day upon your usage
 But the worst part is its 3.5 his charging time which is damn disturbing
 Of someone doesn have the patience of charging it for so long then hesse should have to buy a reliable power bank with it
 Otherwise if you are bored with your first time samsung's poor performance in this same price range then i would suggest you just go for it it wont disappoint you like samson did

Ibnul
 Fellow After using this phone around 5months(still using I am writing my experience
 I always preferred 10-12k range phone for medium use like email couple of apply camera but no games
 I was really a proud user liking so much
 The display camera performance was very impressive
 I did not have any issue fist two months
 Even recommended so many friends
 But slowly it started showing its actual characteristics
 I started getting issues one by one
 Taking call now it takes more time connecting any number
 sometime have to make several tries
 Contacts: It takes much time to open
 Hung if couple of apes are opened in background it will hung
 You can not do anything without restarting.
 Surprisingly showing similar kind issues on other two mobile at my officer
 oka Updated to Lollipop hoping the issues may go but frustrated problems increased
 To my love ka the end with Motorola.
 I am still using this since no option I can not afford or buy another phone within months again
 Also wanted to inform the users who does not look at the SAR value before buying
 It has highest SAR value than any other reputed brandy just like the Chinese honest
 Very SAD.
 Thanks Ibnul

 Actually my mobile drying very lastly , some times my mobile is hanging and some times only one him is working . in that time three to four times i call to FLIPKART customercare people
 they spoke to me like its a small problem just start the mobile then it should be rectified
 so i fallow their sugitions.
 but last two months on words regular i faced that problems in that time i call to flipkart customer care people they spoke to like flipkart is only responsible for first one month only .
 they suggested me to visit MOTOROLA service center.two
 weeks back i cal to motorola customer care no 1800 102 2344.
 they are giving some steps for me .
 in unable to do that steps so they told to me like visit the customercare.
 so 10-02-2015 i visited your secundrabad branch
 from there on words other problem comes in to the picture
 10-02-2015 03.15 pm i visited your service enter nearly 30-45 its i waited for the service people
 they are not giving the response properly .
 they a not giving the proper information to the customers
 they shouting bitterly on us they
 taken my mobile and spoke to me with in 24 hours we can inform you status and the problem of the mobile and how any days it can be taking to resolve the problem.but
 i dont have any update from them so again i call to customercare on 12-02-15 around pm .
 they asking me about Work-order number . in my application they are not mention about Work-order number
 they spoke to me like if you have Work-order number only i can half you in that time i call service center but there are not responding . in that time i raise complaint on service enter people to the customer care people
 Finally again i visited service center in13-02-15 evening around 4 pm .
 i enquire them about status of my mobile and why dont they mention the Work-order number(4084) .
 but they dont give any information to me
 they giving negligible answers
 they shouting on me
 finally giving the Work-order number number and spoke to me it can be taking nearly 15 to 20 days time
 i call to customercare in 14-1-02-15 they spoke to me like that Work-order number is always alpha numarics only
 they given face number
 so again i have to visit the service center ???? Actually service center is 10-15 km from my place
 it can be taking nearly one hour time to visit the service center
 my office tidings are 9am-7pm.
 in fully busy with my work and officer
 dont have the time to visit service center
 if even i visit the service center they are not probably responding to us
 two days back i bought a new mobile for my self any way i dont wait up to 3 weeks for my mobile in fully passionate about moto go
 that why i bought the mobile Actually i reserved defect-mobile i disappointed about that mobile i fully depressed with your service center people its a very bad experience with MOTOROLA

 I was using Samsung S dues 2 before buying G2.
 To i feel the battery life is really good Os we all know its faster and can pay for the internal memory and forget to mention its god for gazing
 Mostly moto mobile are one of the first to get the software updated - Camera is not unto the standards especially front cam is too flurry
 - The clarity of the sound from the speaker is not good especially when it comes to music - Battery cannot be removed Consider A6000 before buying Os

Arun Goyal
 I bought the phone about four months back
 From the beginning the audit was not very clear but I thought I could live with this
 One fine day all of sudden it just gave Motorola log screen only - There was no falling down or any other external factor I could attribute this to
 First I tried on line support but it was of no much help
 I took this to their authorized service center
 I was informed that the mother board has problem and it will need to be replaced and I will get the hand set back in 5-8 days
 It is more than 12 days now and I still have no confirmation as to when will I get this!!!!! Either the authorized service center nor Motorola has any definite status Typical answer is that the case has been excavated and someone will call with in 24 -48 hours to give the update but no one calls
 I strongly suggest that Motorola should have policy of replacing the hands rather than depending on supply of motherboard.

 I bought the phone about four months back
 From the beginning the audit was not very clear but I thought I could live with this
 One fine day all of sudden it just gave Motorola log screen only - There was no falling down or any other external factor I could attribute this to
 First I tried on line support but it was of no much help
 I took this to their authorized service center
 I was informed that the mother board has problem and it will need to be replaced and I will get the hand set back in 5-8 days
 It is more than 12 days now and I still have no confirmation as to when will I get this!!!!! Either the authorized service center nor Motorola has any definite status Typical answer is that the case has been excavated and someone will call with in 24 -48 hours to give the update but no one calls

 Excellent hands in the price only Fifty gig bite drop box or cloud memory is little tricky
 His product is working perfectly superb
 I am using the same
 GPRS and Mobile network data with net use would kill the battery fast To be careful and use wisely

 Awesome mobile from Moto Opens are truly impressive with some sons like 1. RAM could have been more least go 2. Full os was possible although current resolution not bad 3. Battery Capacity logical for dual him and big screen to be least 3500mah Feels very good to hold in hand the 5 inch motor
 It the given price point one can blandly go for it

 It is probably the best one at this price with such good hardware & specie
 The one & only flaw as per my usage was the battery back up
 With such a bright display & os screen U need to have least 2300 may battery
 But still go for it if u r not a game

 I had a very bad experience with Moto-G and Men Within less than 5 months the battery ceased to work and had to take it to the service center
 The biggest con is that the battery cannot be removed it is inbuilt.
 Very disappointing
 os Of the phone gets stuck when all fails the last resort is to plug the battery and the device will restarted that is not possible with this device
 Another big disappointing factor is - the phone has just 1 os RAM.
 For a big phone 1GB is too less and hence it last
 One thing I like about the phone is the Camera - camera is quite good
 The lollypop update tried to compensate for the dislike I had but canst seem to overcome the obvious latency.
 Overall I will never buy nor will recommend anyone to buy it
 In the contrary Moto E is far better

 First of all a big thanks to Flipkart for their quick delivery

 His set is really mind blowing...I have already upgrade it to Android 5.0.2
 Lolipop.
 In Lolipop it runs really smooth...great color resolution...no strain to eyes Shalt 8 is running quite smooth so no tension with the B RAM...sound quality is superb for the dual speaker...

 I bought this phone through flipkart, and it arrived on next day
 The phone is amazing and it is perfectly intact much better than what can be seen in the webster
 However the sad part is that the accessories are really of bad design
 The earphones are just like old nikita phone and moto could have been much better to get with design and elegance of motor
 The charger is of very less out put ~450 mA/550mA which charges this 2000mA phone very slow
 But this is surely a value for money

 ask is too much for this specs.. and battery life is also average day maximum in moderate use Moto should cut this phone price...

 I bought the phone in Oct,2014 and now the display of the phone is not working for me
 It goes of for hours and then visible for 5-10mins.
 I went to Service center in noise sec-18.
 There the people sitting are even worse
 They dont even tell the issue with the phone and keep on saying that it will be tested and you will get it back after 15 days
 Motorola should replace the phone in such cases

 MOTOROLA issue NO: [Incident: 150204-028386] I am writing this to contact you regarding the replacement of my MotoG2 handset.
 I have been given your contact information regarding the replacement of MotoG2 hands which I bought from Flipkart somewhere around September ( on 24-09-2014, see voice attached .
 Within 3 months the phone stopped working and the service center guy told me that motherboard was damaged
 After 3 weeks when my phone started working the camera stopped working and now again I have to contact the service center and God knows how much time it will take to repair
 I tried factory rest camera updated and even installed other/Google camera software but even then it is not working
 It seems to me that the hardware of my hands have some serious issues and even if I got my camera fixed there is no guarantee that some other problem wont be coming in near future
 Os its better if you can replace the set and provide me a new one since this is totally a hardware problem and I want a replacement of my phone
 Hope to get a prompt response from you
 Customer care shared two numbers with me Regional head details Swish Until - ashish.patil@ensureservices.in
 Contact - 9324395043 Carved Awed - parvez.jawed@b2x.com
 Contact - 8826579279 Ashish's no is always busy and Parvez's no does not exist
 Any kind of help appreciated
 Thanks

 Thanks to flipkart on delivery the product very next day .
 Now when it comes to product I was surprised on the display which is awesome , but very disappointing except display all others are average .
 And the major problem is that it will not show the DATA (Internet) icon .
 when checked in moto forum it was come to know it is a bug in lollipop for MOTOG gen .
 Entire phone hangs often and very difficult to use the product os Os check in internet before you buy this product .
 Again I am saying MOTOg having issue only with Lolipop update .

 Hello Everyone – him totally frustrated by FlipKart services and it is one of my worst experience till date
 Thus it has resulted me to write below email and inform my other friends about the actual work done by them
 I ordered a new Motog2 mobile phone from Flipkart.
 After 3 to 4 days it got dispatched at my home place – Within 3 months of purchase – One fine day my phone completely stopped working
 Os I visited to nearby service center – I was really shocked to know that the problem in my phone was related with the Motherboard.
 When I checked Invoice, I found that Voice copy was Incorrect
 His was not at all expected from the FlipKart services
 Os I called them and reported about the issue
 Due to incorrect voice I could not submit the phone at service centre
 I had to called flipkart multiple times but response was same every time – “ Will soon change your Invoice”.
 Also they want snapshot of my mobile phone so that they can update the invoice, that mean they do not have proper information regarding which mobile was sent to me
 While followup, according to one of executive no need to provide snapshot and ignore that mail but second executive says(after 2-3 days need to send snapshot or either tell us the correct IMEI number
 It was really a pain for me to do a follow-up on such bullshit scenario
 Now this would be possible – Within 3 months of purchase Motherboard got dead
 Os here I believe that there just making customers fool
 I reported same issue to FlipKart but till today there is no proper response
 him really helpless here – To one turned till today
 all soon update this all in social sites
 Also will recommend my other friends – Not to purchased any of the electronic devices from Flipkart.
 It is really bad You guns are cheating us

 Its been 3 days now that i have been using this product after getting bored with my erstwhile Samsung Galaxy SIII.
 His phone is phenomena in terms of processor & overall user experience
 Not the latest "Lolipop" O/S upgrade as soon as i received this device
 His upgrade really rocks
 Would rate 5/5 for this product & thanks to os retail in delivering the product in less than 48 hours time frame
 Have recommended this phone to all

 They providing non-proper information in webster
 I have purchased this mobile one month ago
 I just taken in packet the mobile in little bit rain
 The phone was went off
 His was not a water resistant
 Even the support not works for me until now
 When we contact server center they are not taking service
 Asking for 80% amount for service
 By suggestion go with sonya mobile for water resistant
 His guns are putting face news

 I have used Moto G must Men and recently bought this Moto G and Gen).
 With all the hope created around it I was they'll retain the quality of st genu if not improve some features
 But I am really disappointed with the battery life
 The battery is not running even for full 12 hours with not so extensive usage
 Most of the time my phone is deposited at reception and not used
 Another thing is this misleading hittel offer
 They have Os network in very limited circles and for that you have to have some balance in your repaid account
 They flood you with automatic messages where if you dont read and just tap OK, your balance drains faster than the water from your washbasin.
 Buy the phone only if you are genuinely impressed by it
 wont fall in trap of these misleading offers

 Motorola has the worst after sale service
 have using this phone for last 3 months with single SIM.
 When I tried to place the SIM in him sloth the slot was not able to detect the SIM.
 I reached to service center and after examining the phone they told me that slot is damaged Now could a slot be damaged when actually I never used it
 They deposited my phone and told me that it will take 10 days to get repair
 It has been 14 days and till now phone is not repaired
 When ever I speak to the service center executive they extend the date by another 10 Days
 Called the customer support center and they provide and os and assured than with 24 hours all be getting call back regarding update status
 It has been 4 days and I have not received any call regarding my phone
 His is very frustrating.
 To if you are planning to buy this phone please do kept in mind that their is no after sale support from motorola.
 Moto is least concern about its customers
 In case anyone wants to known my cases By SR# 150209010831.

 I ordered this phone on th Web 2015.
 It was supposed to be delivered on th An by 7 pmb
 Though the status of cracking was shown as But for delivery from 12.10 pm itself I did not receive the product till the end of the day
 When I contracted the customer care @ 7.30 pm for this they just told me to wait and assured that it will be delivered by 9 pmb
 But it did not happen
 Again when I contracted they told me that it will be delivered by the though it happens to be a Sunday
 Again @ 11.14 am the status was updated as But for delivery
 I did not receive any single call form the Part the whole day
 But @ 1.12 pmb it has been updated in their system as "Undelivered Os Customer Requested For Reschedule".
 Without even trying to call the customers they have updated this status
 When I contracted Flipkart stating this issue they were not even ready to check with Part about this
 They only told me to wait till with Debt Flipkart simply wants to hold the customers and make them wait by giving false promises
 I have received the product now but they have not yet responded to complaint that I have raised
 I am totally dissatisfied and disappointed with Flipkart's service
 Hopeless
 They just think they have captured the market and the customers will not leave them even if they provide the worst service
 They have mistaken
 Must know it Flipkart!
 You are not the only one in this market
 You will be extinct very soon if you continue your service at this level

 I bought the Moto G and Gen).
 I feel i made a mistaken
 There are much better honest
 The biggest problem with this phone is that when you are on a call the voice is so loud that everyone sitting beside you can hear them
 Despite of reducing the volume to the minimal level people can still hear the voice outside
 I asked flipkart to change the product the product for me but they denied it
 Even the Motorola Customer service people are unaware of what they are doing
 I asked them to help and they said you must have download some wrong application

 3. When you doing low the brightness of the phone it dippering.

Ankish Raj Prajapati
 I own both the st and the and Men
 For starters, Moto G and Men is not at all a worthy upgrade to the st and it failed to create the same impact
 The camera is good but not much of improvement really
 It has two front facing speakers yet the fire at lower volume than the single rear speaker on the st Men
 The battery back is very slightly lesser than the st although it is hardly noticeable
 Now coming to performance
 His phone performed good on Kitkat, although no comparison with the st Men
 It lagged a bit while twitching between applications
 Despite the same hardware the st easily outperforms it and games run much smoother and load faster
 After the Lollipop updated the difference in performance has widened even more
 st Men perform very well on Lollipop.
 Resource management is better than even that on Nexus 5.
 But on the and Men it has created a number of problems like unnecessary laws even when you switch the iii on
 James take even longer to load
 Not at all satisfactory
 Overall I would say that in this budget Us Zenfone 5 is the better than this phone both in terms of performance and camera
 Of you want to go with Samsung, the Leo 3 is also a good option
 Moto G and Men is disappointing and drops the standard the st had raised

 I have been using the phone for last 5 days and i have upgrade the OS to lollipop the very same day i bought it
 The phone is pretty good gang by the midrange standards
 However the battery drain is a big issue
 I guess it has it to do more with the OS than the phone
 The phone doesn seem to last me for more than 8-10 hours after a full charge and the too with just normal usage
 To heavy games no excessive download n surging just usual chats n phone calls n still m shocked to see my battery entering the red zone by the th hours
 I am really disappointed co i haunt had such issues with my previous phone which was lucia 520.
 Only fr the battery drain i regret buying this phone
 I hope goose fixes this issue soon with an updated
 N a lollipop sucks really
 West all is an excellent package
 so if u dint mind charging or phone twice a day...thn go ahead buy it

 I raised this issue to Flipkart and they replaced it with new Moto G phone
 But again surprised with new phone now problem with speaker phone os Now Flipkart is defending my booking amount..! Had experience with Product quality os os Flipkart is always rousing on Customer satisfaction but somewhere product quality is lagging behind

 After Dating the phone in Android Lolipop,After few days of See Shone start getting hang and Low 2. The background apes are automatically getting refreshed
 Its create problem while doing bank transactions or ticket booking
 But one thing I want to mention that this issue is in every Moto G 2.
 Not Very Time but It does sometimes
 After updating, this issue is decreased but not corrected
 3. Except these things Very thing is fine
 Good Shone in this Price Age
 And obviously best services from Flipkart.

 no glitches.
 Rough to get the lip cover or a case to fit this model in white color
 Ordered a white lip cover red but was small in size though the label was for the Moto 2G.
 Probably color puts a lot of limitation on availability

 I bought the Moto G and Men with express delivery only to find that it was a defective piece
 From day one there has been audit issues reported by my sister
 It took a while for me to physically see the device and confirm that there were audit issues
 By then when I raised a return request flipkart replied that the stipulated time for return by the seller has crossed
 Fig fail
 I would rather visit a office showroom and pick a better device
 It least I can go daytime for replacement
 wont fall for the no questions asked return policy
 Its only the webster

 I got a defective hand set delivered by Flipkart.
 The mobile works only on turning on the speaker else the person on the other side of the phone is unable to hear me
 The phone gets charged in just 15 mind of time to 100% and gets discharged in 1 hours
 His was my day 1 experience
 Such a poor customer care service
 I have given a return request and none of of the customer care executive are ready to take up my calls
 Either their server is down to see my details or they are extremely busy to give me a cal back
 Have already tried 5 times but to no response
 Horrible experience!!!!!!

 Brilliant phone for the prices
 The lollipop upgrade makes the phone look and feel pretty also makes the user experience so much better
 Of your looking for a sub 15K smart phone - you canst go wrong with the moto G P.s.
 Flipkart's service is pretty sweet
 The initial phone I received had a problem with its speaker they had it replaced in a days time

 i have been using it for two month actually i bought two devices
 while using them i faced some issues with touch screen,mic,speakers.
 To i visited nearest service center
 That i saw there will shock you
 There was a big line of MOTO users
 Very one of them daring MOTO E MOTO G MOTO G2.
 And all of them looks very disappointed
 Motorola service is very bad i mean very very bad
 They kept my device for 1 month and after receiving it also i faced so many problems
 To i strongly suggest you to not to buy this device

 Os far as Motorola is concerned it gives you a good built quality and good features for the prices
 It also guarantees you update so its always better to go for a brand rather than local bands for more or less the same prices

 I am terrified flipkart buyer since the beginning and have written all positive reviews till today
 That makes me write a negative one
 I had ordered a Moto G and generation on with feb 2015.
 His was my rd Moto G and this time I was going to gift it to my brother on his birthday
 The unit was dispatched by os retail on time,but today morning when I checked the status of the item..I was shocked to see Cancelled!
 I called the customer care...they told me I canceled the item
 I tried to convince them that I did not but they didn listen to me..so I requested to talk to their os then Or Run Human came online and when I asked him why was my shipment cancelled..then I was shocked again to the reply he gave me..he said it was canceled by the courier company as you did not receive their call
 I told him why mud the courier company call me when the product has not even reached my city and no one actually called...then he slipped his answer and said no sir you canceled it.This is the customer service of India biggest commerce webster
 Now I was told to order the product again...now when I am trying to order the product..I am shocked again to notice...it says not available with any seller at my pincode!
 When how come flipkart delivered the same product 2 weeks back
 Flipkart is losing it and has already lost my trust
 By brother wont get the gift which I promised him

 Moto Os performance issue starts within 3 os months of purchase
 They say it is gorilla glass but phone screen gets Scratches even when phone and War keys are kept in your jeans
 Customer service centre takes 15 days to check what is issue and does not do anything more than mobile Clash
 I would have given minus rating if there was option

Akanksha
 I have been using this phone from past 5 months
 Its an amazing phone and the price range is actually too good to be true
 With some negative like you cannot use wife direct without an external pp little heavy in weight headphones are not the kind you expect to come with good smartphones and charger does not have a detachable us cord
 But still when you compare all these things with the speed of the phone battery back-up, overall user interface and amazing features you forget about the sons of the products
 Unlike other smartphones, it never hangs and even when multi-tasking, it responds very very fast
 Overall him simply in love with the phone
 Os far as Flipkart is concerned its the best online shopping webster
 Very quick and prompt delivery
 I ordered this phone and got the delivery the day after
 The products are always packed very nicely
 I trust os Detail and never got any wrong or damaged product ordered from this seller
 Thanks to Flipkart Team for making online shopping so easy and trust worthy

 I am very much trusted about Battery back up
 An anybody help me how I can increase the Battery back up

 I Ought Moto G from Flipkart looking at its good reviews and good company profile
 MOTO phone have been a monopoly of flipkart.
 It has really bad primary and secondary camera..Showing face colors
 I requested company that I am not satisfied with this product and i request you to kindly change it with some different company which was turned down by their representative Or Faizal.
 Flipkart can replace the product but cannot change the product co it knows that it is a cheap quality product and its sale has going down co of this
 That is why they are offering exchange old phone scheme
 By order id is OD201999471375807600, I have been buying a lot of products from flipkart, I can expect such a response from fipkart.

 But considering the feedback and cost I bought this one

 To now I have a great phone with latest OS.
 The phone works perfectly fine and have been facing no issues yet

 I know there no need to write a review on performance and speck of Moto go
 It is simply awesome, which is why I bought this device
 However I doubt whether there is some defect in the and gen Moto g devices
 1.
 One of my friend who bought Moto G and genu had to return the device after 3-4 months as it was not footing
 Service center says motherboard problems
 Luckily it was during the warranty period
 2. New weeks later in today the phone I bought is not charging
 Motherboard problem - says service centre
 When I inquired found that many users are facing the same motherboard related complaints recently
 To I suggest make your choice wisely

 Not this mobile last September my first pure andros since 2009.
 A lot better than the samson june that is being sold at exorbitant prices and fails to give consumers anything
 have used the device extensively back when it was Ice cream sandwich mitka and now Lollipop.
 Its come a long way
 Its still my favorite mobile
 Only pitch is that using in at bangalore with any network The network here is so bad that the battery drains by 10 in the morning
 Using it elsewhere or in a single him it just lasts and lasts
 One word of advice if you are using the dual him functionality, make sure that they are on the same operators
 His helps save your battery
 With more than one user mode on the device am now able to configure multiple users one for home and one for work
 And keep both separated
 Of you are looking for a budget motorola mobile close eyes get this os

 Nothing works in it
 Voice All one way....no sound at receiver when calling
 Internet intermittently works
 SIM gets out of detection quite often Battery Trains out all of sudden from 67% to os ( I have saved the Graph to prove this
 To privacy as the receiver sound is clearly audible outside as like Loudspeaker.
 Moreover post sales care from Flipkart as well Technical support services by Motorola is Pathetic
 In one word its a piece of crap'.

 His wont be a phone that you fall hard and fast for
 It wont sweep you off your feet nor will it dazzled you with a slew of whizzing features
 hats just fine thought
 Because none of that changes the fact that the Moto G is still the best budget smartphone you can buy today
 Using the thing isn as regulatory an experience as firing up the new Moto X was but Motorola's long list of seemingly modest improvements collectively add up to a device that worth your attention

 The product Moto G had mild noise disturbance in the handset's earpiece, hence I asked for a replacement which was also given by Flipkart.
 The replaced new product also had the same issue of mild disturbance in the apiece during calls now I asked for a refund since the issue is repeating the and time
 Today the Flipkart Team approved my request after speaking to me they asked me to go the service center which didn want to hence they told me that they will pick up the defective piece by with Feb'14 and refund my amount by 8 days but everything was done by today itself
 Lockup was done by pm refund was done by 9.30pm to my wallet then I called and asked to credit it to my account which was done immediately
 Excellent and Incredible customer service
 I have never experienced such levels of customer service in any retail store anywhere
 Of you maintain this service level all buy everything from you

 I ordered this phone on Web st 2015 and got it promptly by the afternoon of Web and
 The packing and all the other stuff like speck have been spoken about already so all just skin on that
 Now its been a week since I got the phone up and running for me
 From what have gathered by looking at reviews for this phone before buying it I must say that I am indeed lucky to get a good piece
 Os soon as I booted it up and signed in it showed that the Lollipop update was waiting for me
 I quickly upgrade my phone and started using it
 To here my experience with the phone os The interface super smooth and feels awesome to use
 os The battery is awesome even though my phone has iii enabled for about 15 hours a day and also only when I start playing heavy games the battery starts to drain a bit faster than usual
 ->The earphones are okay
 him not against the Moto earphones, but and have liked it with the buds
 ->The camera quality is better than what I thought it would be
 os Also some people faced problems wit the lock button and the volume rockers, but i found them compact and firm
 In the whole holding the phone feels good and using it feels way too good

 I wanted to replace my Samsung Galaxy Os and Phone with this dual SIM phone
 By Samsung GS3 served me well for 2 years but off late had become very baggy and the battery life had become quite bad
 I purchased a new 2250 Ah battery from RAW but that did not help much
 It seems the phone needed more battery after all the upgrade
 I was initially a 32 os memory card on the phone and recently installed a 64 os memory cards
 By phone was a 16 os model and was running out of memory
 The Motorola Second Generation is a well designed easy to hold phone
 The first time you start up the phone the screen looks washed out on goose play compared to the Samsung Galaxy Os but this is not a screen problems
 Samsung phone seem to have over-saturated vivid displays which will make most phone look pale
 The screen on the Moto G is good and something you will quickly get used to
 The pure andros OS is also nice
 It operate smoothly but is not fast
 The points that I do not like about the phone are 1.
 Though I purchased the phone for the pure andros experience the pure andros experience leaves you feeling short changed
 The enhancements made by mobile manufactures though not the best for performance are really good for usage and I soon started missing these
 2. AC3 audit is not support on several video files
 The same video files worked without issues on the Galaxy
 H/W deciding also did not work on several video
 The H/W decide option works for all files on the Os 3. The camera firmware or camera is very poor text can never be captured correctly
 I used both the Phone and Samsung for OCR from clicked photo
 His cannot be done with the Moto G second gen since the text cannot be cleanly captured 4. Mile transfer rates from the file to a memory card are slower than the Galaxy
 I regularly download files and move them to the memory cards
 While I get 9 MB/s on the 32 os card in the Galaxy the same card gives me 6 MB/s on the Moto Os 5.
 For some reason the screen never feels bigger
 In all text applications the amount of text that fits on Galaxy and Moto G is the same
 I believe this is because the phone are very close in screen size and the sealing probably happens at a slightly larger screen size
 However the phone also has the following good points
 1. Good battery life can last through the day 2. On baggy performance 3. Good WIFI connection 4. Recently fast brother experience 5. Quick singing of photos and holders even if you dont want them synced!!!) I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Os almost 3 years ago for 22,400.
 The moto G second generation prices at 12,999, doesn make the Os look long in the tooth after such a long time which speaks a lot about the hardware on both honest
 The Moto G has average hardware but a great implementation
 Except for the AC3 audit everything works fine
 The pure andros does not give it the polish of a Os but everything works well when needed
 Of you want a great phone for productivity reminders OCR, fantastic photos and video any phone will be a seriously good phone
 I am not replacing both my honest
 Of the Samsung Galaxy Os had a dual SIM option and a better battery life I would have made that my primary phone
 For now I continue to use the phone and the new Moto Os which is disappointing
 For the price of a Moto G second gen there are lots of good phone available and they have much better camera interface but Of you want a sick well built lag free phone that wont go slow on you after many upgrade I believe the Moto G second gen is good choice

 Recent display with good sunlight legibility.
 Great call quality
 The speakers are placed on the front is the only thing I did not like

 Battery life is great with one him but with 2 simon it will just get through the day

 Motorola's come back vehicle was Moto X and Moto G Both st Men Moto G was prices Rs13999/-.
 Great phone and great prices
 Moto G 2014 was prices Rs12999/- His is my personal opinion but I feel that 1.2GHZ seems a little underpowered for a inch display
 I dont understand why reduce the prices
 Deep the same price and offer little something more
 Like a bigger battery or a better chipset.
 There is no lag in everyday use but sometime when there are a 10 or so windows open in the background you do notice slight lag in Kitkat.
 Lollipop have made the phone more refined
 In normal use you dont find the battery inadequate but use it a little heavily and the battery drain is quite noticeable
 One needs to use the phone keeping in mind that days itinerary!
 I am happy with the device with a few complaints which really shouldn matter for the price

Rakesh Nayak
 Mentioning anything about this phone would be bit less as per the specification mentioned it proves its worth
 The only con found is its battery life which Motorola needs to work upon a bit
 Else & otherwise..its an All-rounder phone
 By rating here proves the worth of price & had gifted it to my Beloved on our Anniversary
 Going for the other Chinese brand & cheaper bands wouldn help you much rather go for a Grand which keeps it value & words
 Also Flipkart have done a good Mob for Customers with tie-up of SBI Cards & an additional discount of 10%, adds one more advantage to buy this phone
 Cheers to Motorola & Flipkart as well!!! Regards Takes

 Product is sleek and the performance is Very good
 Satisfied with the screen and touch quality Voice quality and design of the hands which is awesome.
 The moto log is prominent and is the resting place for your index finger during calls and message also helps well handling of the phone
 Comes to Battery which is average almost used up in approve
 10 hours
 One drawback with Moto customer care support as service centers are not easily available in all cities like Samsung & Nokia.
 Camera quality is good
 Right weight Mobile in this range and functions

 Camera is more than enough for casual pick
 Stereo, front facing speakers sounds nice and when haired with decent headphones the audit quality is great a clear improvement from Moto G 2013. but the in box earbuds are bad as before
 Battery life could have been better as on heavy use days I am forced to use battery bank at end of the day
 Software is clean and smooth though at times the Launched redress are a bit annoying
 Overall a great phone for the prices

 have been using this phone for two months and the interface is amazing and lag free unless one updated the phone to 5.0.2
 Lollipop.. Else it is one of the best phone to buy in the market and the camera too is amazing both front and read)..
 The front facing speakers also look class and the expandable storage makes the buy a steal ...but moto please offer extra covers too for more variety Flipkart please send COD orders faster as i had to wait for almost a week for the phone and recommend all to buy this phone for its reliability took

Udaya Shankar...
 Delivery is excellent from Flipkart but if you face problem with phone the customer service at flipkart is very disappointing
 In my experience this is a very poor phone from Motorola.
 Please avoid buying this

Urvi Verma
 I All I purchased MOTO Os from Flipkart and had the worst experience every
 The camera quality is pathetic and pictures taken at night are hardly visible
 The battery drains too much hardly 6-8 hours of back with a Os connection and takes a lot of time to charge mostly overnight charging
 The gorilla glass is not up to expectations as scratches come to is very easily
 Speakers gives a cracking noise at high volumes which is very annoying and unacceptable
 And to top it off during the update from mitka to lollipop the phone just crashed and i am unable to start it since then
 The mobile keeps starting and nothing is happening I feel terrible now to have brought this phone as it feels like a waste of money
 wont know what to do would recommend all of you to think again before buying this products

 Moto Os - Reliable product with stable built quality , performance tormented hardware and with recent update to Lollipop is surely going to surplus leading bands at this prices
 I expect quick updated in future once released and increase in Service Centres across India so that any bug in terms of hardware and software should be addressed immediately without follow up
 Thanks clot flipkart for providing great deals and establishing strong shipment network but still you have to widen your network

 Of your planning to buy moto g 2 because of its brandy then please dont 2 months after I bought my phone it crashed and they told me that my mother board needs to be replaced because apparently quite a few Motorola phone are facing this problems
 Its been over 2 weeks since I gave my phone for repair and I haven got it back yet
 The service is terribly slow and disappointing
 The worst part is that I lost all 8 go of data id stored on my phone so thank god for auto back up that i could recover some of it
 Part from the fact that my phone crashed its also most inconvenient to use and needs an pp for almost everything including one to set a song as or ringtone and a file explorer among others
 The camera lacks basic option like time and resolution settings
 The drop down menu is very tiresome for example it requires u to go to settings then display then auto rotate instead of the usual single click
 Also it dont come with a connection cable is if u dont have one from an old phone then that going to be a problems
 Its little things like these that make it very frustration to use this phone
 The best phone for this price is ASUS ZENFONE 5. Its a brilliant phone amazing processing useful built apply a drop down list u can edit based on or convenience and an overall a much more satisfactory phone
 have used both phone and buying moto g 2 to replace my Zenfone 5 when it got stolen :/) was a bad decision on my part and I urge u to not make the same mistaken
 Am sure you've seen a lot of statistics but from a user point of use Us Zenfone 5 is the best choice at this price range and Moto g 2 is a huge disappointment

 have used many phone but truly this phone stands at a higher position than the rest
 And moreover it will be upgrade to Google's sweetest Lollipop (5.0.2) Rose 1.
 A class cool professional look
 2. Comes with Android Mitka (4.4.4)
 But recently have been upgrade to Lollipop (5.0.2) 3. It was fast before but amazingly fast after the lollipop updated
 4. Good storage space (16 os internal with expandable storage 5.
 It is rain water proof
 Its not a problem if its in your pocket when its raining
 But that doesn mean you should try it out with a bucket full of water
 Some on!!! Its not Peri Z series 6.
 have more than 85 apes installed in my phone (facebook, skype, Chrome, hangout, Line temple run os and 2), subways suffer compass Picsart, camscanner, Flipkart, Instagram, Paytm, HDFC, redbus, Truecaller, messenger what pp and many more Even after that it runs amazing fast with only 1 os RAM. 7. To need to switch it off for changing aims or memory cards
 8. Camera quality is awesome in bright light
 and in low light its good
 9. Touch is awesome, though have matter screen guards but the smoothness is amazing
 10.
 Round is good as they have made the speakers in front
 11.
 An be charged with any USB charges unlike Ami Redmi, which canst be charged with any charge
 Sons 1.
 The charger sometimes get hot in some particular charging points not at all charging points Though the phone doesn get hot
 2. The LED ratification light color is white
 It canst be changed to any other color
 3.
 You canst remove the battery

 I would say that this is the best phone available right now for under 20000 INR.
 I have used it for like 3 months and haven faced any issues like hanging etc Not my Lollipop update just a few days back as promised
 The touch is crisp like poetry in motion...
 The camera is very good
 The sound is pretty decent took
 Only thing is that I would have liked the speakers to be a bit louder like the Foka phone but then again you canst have everything

 Writing this review after using the the phone for 2-3 days
 Good Its Moto Awesome screen quality Stock andros experience Camera in daylight Vice grip and easy to hold Improved speakers Had Battery back is not that good as compared to moto g st gen Camera in lowliest conditions Speakers give cracking noise at maximum volume Of you are thinking to buy this mid-range smartphone with ask it would be a great deal according to me dont matter which phone you used before or this is first smartphone.
 I liked moto G and gen very much then any other Grands because of its display quality
 I order on with Jan'15 & got my product delivered on th Web 15.
 its awesome but the problem was in the font camera & key section
 The front facing camera picture quality is ok but when i press the capture button its not taking the photo immediately it captures the photo after 5-6 seconds.The second problem is very bad response from the volume rocket buttons
 Os i requested for replacement on th Web 15 accepted by flipkart.
 Gets see how fast flipkart soles their customers problems

 I was using Samsung S Quos 2 for the past 1 year and though I was a bit resistant to change it I am happy I bought Moto G and Men Amazing phone really Easy to use and comfortable in your hand
 Also fits easily into your pocket
 Added to that the pure andros OS makes it even better
 The screen is also good and can text using single hand
 Right weight and feels amazing to handle
 Of you are looking for a phone in the ask price range this the best one to buy

 I bought it 4 months back for my DAD.
 I am a Samsung enthusiast but same old design of Samsung are coming
 You will not understand which model is which???!!!! Now coming back to Moto G and Men
 After a setback from International market Motorola managed to launch a phone which grabbed a mass market all over the world with Moto Os G & now with Moto Os & X2.
 His phone comes in Mid-Priced mobile
 Its looks are very good & its back cover gives a nice grip took
 Must few days ago Moto rolled out Lollipop update for all mobile and it good and faster than Mitka at least I feel the same
 It comes with raw OS so you will miss out some important apes like flash light etc which you can download from Lay Stores
 I will not go in technical details but its display color recreation & video output is really good
 Also display comes with Morning Gorilla Glass 3.0.
 With 2 front speakers it not a loud phone but speaker volume is good
 & in box head phone are waste do not use you will feel pain after some time... Specially camera of Moto G is awesome & it can capture good details in day light but you will observe a little noise in night shots
 Its flash is power full
 His phone can handle lot of games like If 14, Real Facing os Shalt 8... Minor heating is observed after some game play
 All in all its a great phone to buy under 15K... Cheers to Moto :-)

SSS
 Have been using the phone now for about two months
 1. Battery life is terrible even on 2G, with wife bluetooth off
 2. Extremely slow and hangs at least twice a day both on Lollipop and the earlier version 3. I used the Moto E for 8 months which had a fantastic battery and performance and upgrade to Moto G and Men thinking this was a step up but it isn't.
 I canst move back to the Moto E because the board memory is insufficient for most basic apply
 I regret buying this and because of this I do not have the confidence to buy the Moto Os

 First of all I would like thank Flipkart for their prompt one day delivery
 I was looking for a phone wherein i was not ready to spend too much money on the phone since the prices keep fluctuating in the market day by day and at the same time was looking for a exchange of my Samasung Galaxy Os Flipkart was kind offering this product with an exchange along with 10% discount on HDFC card which is a cracked
 Now over to the phone His is a 5 inch display phone with Gorilla protective glass which is scratch proof resistant
 It comes with KitKat OS and i have already upgrade to Lollipop.
 The battery back is not very useful as claimed by the manufacturer unless not continuous browsing watching video or playing games
 Of none of these are used the battery can be easily managed for 1.5 days
 Its a RAW andros and display looks just fine
 The camera is crisp and clear though it does not have Image Stabilization, so expect pictures to be blurred or grains under low light
 It does not hang and sometimes it heat up which is quite normal in any phone for that matter
 The battery is not detachable and will need to be taken to the service center for replacement
 The packing of this material was awesome, thanks to Flipkart.

 The phone is fast not because of its hardware but because of its software
 The stock andros interface is no nonsense and ultra light
 It may not respond to links and blows but using regular features of a smart phone like calling messaging, browsing etc is usually appealing but super fast
 For those who understand motorcycles, its like riding a two stroke
 Right fast and fun to use
 Overall the phone feels premium and worth a lot more than what it costs
 To here are the rating comprising Average Good and Very Good
 whereas nothing explicitly bad about this phone
 Hope this helps Build Quality Very Good Features Good Speed Very Good Camera Average Round Average Display Average Battery Average Value for Money Very Good

 To after a much deliberation to get Nexus 5 or Moto G and Men I have gone ahead with Moto due to budget constraint , lol).
 Flipkart got the phone to me one day in-advance than the promised date which is like a happy thing for me
 The phone looks awesome, looks big and slim shaped beauty of the Front cam is an asset to the phone
 Dear Cam is obviously great not to forget
 Os soon as I loaded it up it alarmed me that Lollipop is ready for upgrade
 To I used to mitka version for sometime to explore it was good and immediately upgrade to Lollipop.
 It was simply awesome.
 Moved the new look
 Coming to the phone touch is super cool performance is too good
 battery is what I will have to really check as today is the first day
 Os I would say this looks like a mind NEXUS 5 for me least os Thanks flipkart for being an awesome ambassador for a great phone in Indian

Venkatesh R
 First of all let me introduce myself I am Venkatesh from Chennai who hasn owned a smartphone ever before..!!
 I actually had to think a lot as there were too many option available for me and I had to choose the best
 Meanwhile the Urea from Micromax's U brand played a twirling role in my decision making
 There were many Samsung Os neo offered by Flipkart for 12500, Redmis's, the Micromaxes, the HTC's, the Nokia's...etc etc...woosh..I had a real wobbly and spin into my head..!!!
 I ordered one canceled the next day...!!! Took me nearly a month to zero it to 2 phones...!!
 It was Urea or Moto Os to be chosen..!! Quality or Quantity..? Price or After sales service...? looks or build quality..? Am or life...? It all converted into a single point...Why wasting money into a cap which has greater speck but will have no guarantee to last longer..? I made up my mind to select this one and was not at all disappointed...!!!
 I initially received a product one of whose speaker want working...!! i replaced it with a brand new one and runs awesome...!!! Guess what..? I received the Android 5.0 lollipop update an the same day when I received it..!!! Battery life is average I would say...will drain out real quick if u are a photo maniac and keep clinking photos all day... :-) West suited for the people planning for their first smart phone that should last longer and should be modern and little bit of gaming..!!! Awesome build quality and beautiful design..!!! Thumbs up for this phone for it came on my birthday and its my th day with my buddy...!!!
 I love him and in sure that u will too..!!! Close or eyes and go for it...!!!

 Using the mobile since two months
 To far no issues os Cam were superb for which I had chosen this mobile
 Battery is draining lastly even in battery saving mode os !
 Regarding this Peri Os which I own was doing well
 Overall It was good phone with a little compromise of battery backup.

 Its great phone for the features it is offering at this price but my recommendation would be any other cell phone except this under same price range
 pro os M sure u will get hell lot of pro over web search so shipping it
 sons 1 os Customer service is not that good and representatives are really irritating sometimes
 Os for those who wants to buy a phone and stick with it a bit longer time then my recommendation would be any phone which has good customer care service history
 For egg Samsung , Nokia, Micromax(Indian company-must encourage it sons 2 os You would be luckless alive creature to have a moto gage phone with no network problems
 It is really really irritating to see or network playing hide n seek mostly when u will be needing it more
 Os if u have a Girlfriend who calls u quite frequently be prepared to breakup
 Sons 3 os Dual SIM feature is another myth - It all depends on your for that wen u will be having single working sloth dual working slot or none of the slot working
 Thought twitching it off will serve the purpose
 Well there are lot more but once u r done with all f d above I dont think I have to give u any more details
 Conclusion os Take or time while purchasing one as it is going to stick with u quite for a good time... Os be choose of or selection
 Of some extra bucks will give u satisfaction then its worth spending on
 Good Luck Happy Buying... (Y)

 Flipkart was excellent as usual
 The phone itself has by now been reviewed to death
 Lollipop looks nice on it though does tend to make it lag just enough to be noticeable
 In excellent phone for a not-so-demanding user

 I ordered the phone from flipkart and got it in mint condition
 The packing was very good
 I also bought a motoshell lip cover which was equally prime in quality
 Now coming to the review
 The phone looks just brilliant and has smooth curved edges
 It has got a non-removable battery but that is not an issue for me
 He hardly replace batteries for our smartphones, we just buy a new one!!!
 It ran on andros mitka but later I got the lollipop update and I am using that now
 I have used the phone for a month now
 To clashes and misbehaving UI for me as I have seen in certain forms about Moto Os
 The charger is just a beauty
 It is sleek and white in colour and always does its job
 It gets a bit hot while charging but it is not like it will melt and go out of order
 I am using the phone without any clumsy screen guard Os have the motoshell for that :-)) and till now the screen is jet black and without any scratches
 The os display is mind begging and it is such a joy to watch anything on the screen whether it is playing video or games or just reading books and stuff like that
 I am in love with the digital vibrance of the display
 Its too cool
 Now coming to performance
 Normally out of 1GB of ram 460 - 480 os will always be free
 While running some heavy weight games such as Shalt 8 or Head Trigger it will come down to some 320MB or so
 To according to me it is quite efficient with its RAM usage
 It is a joy to play games on it with it Adreno subsystem.
 There is not noticeable lag on the UI while entering or existing heavy applications
 Battery life its a bit early to comment could have been better but that is not a downside as per me
 The stock headphones are not that good and does not produce good thumb or bass
 I would like Motorola to work on that in future iterations.
 There are no heating issues while playing games
 I have played games for couple of hours straight and the only heat I get is where I hold it that is my own body heat transferred to the set
 The stock andros runs great and I dont like to disturb the ecosystem by installing rubbish apply
 The apes bundles are enough for most of our needs except gaming which we need to download
 Course there is no Mile manager software which is a downside slightly to this awesome product but you can use freely available os Explorer or Solid Explorer for this purpose not a big deal
 The speakers are awesome and generate sterno quality sound
 I am not deferring you from buying Micromax U or Semi mobile but there have there fair share of problems albeit the low prices but Motorola has got it perfect this time with Moto Os
 I would like them to add Os LTE to future models thought
 Hope you find this review helpful
 Thanks and do but it without second thoughts
 You wont regret it :-) :-) :-)

 Despite the lofty claims i was issued a defective piece by flipkart with dead pipes and wobbly power and volume buttons
 Even the battery life seems to be erratic
 I have requested a replacement but this incident has denied my trust in motorola and flipkart.

 Brought moto g 2 about a month ago and very satisfied with its performance
 PROS: Not official lollipop update 5.0.2
 Gives around 12 hours of battery life with Os network
 Camera quality is good with very good flash awe sum sound quality along with screen resolution
 Lay high end games like asphalt, and front line command easily An crash one or two times Internet Drowsing speed is decent
 All quality is good with good noise cancellation CONS: Takes lot of time to charge Headphones provided along with hands are of low quality
 To Data cable provided with accessories.
 Over all a very good budget phone under 13K, a must buy Products

 I was looking for a smartphone for a long time and wanted to settle after careful consideration
 Finally i decided to bank upon MOTO G2.
 First of all Flipkart services were great with delivery within 2 days including a sunday
 The phone is great to use
 Rose os screen Great camera clarity Speaker system Smooth surface Quality of screen guard is so good that even after 2 months i still have the same one on
 Sons To basic file explorer that with kitkat) Should have provided additional data cable that with Moto and not with the phone 2070 may battery not enough for this smartphone.
 also , i got lollipop update and proud user of Moto Os now must go for it ... Flipkart is the best...

Soumyadeep Roy...
 Moto G and Men @13k is a steal deal it doesn feel like a device of any less value than 18k.
 The display is amazing built quality is top class feels sturdy the interface is impeccable.
 Supplied accessories are rubbish but they should have made the charger detachable it is fixed means no USB cable supplied you have to buy or use old spare ones
 But for the price I dont think it leaves anything to complain for
 rates off to Moto for entering a remarkable st gen device into an object of awe
