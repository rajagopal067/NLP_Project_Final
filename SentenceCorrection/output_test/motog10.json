 I am always a fan of MOTOROLA for the last 10 years...This Moto G is very impressive on look performance and prices
 The gorilla screen is superb you dont have to use screen guards
 The battery life is good
 The most important thing I love about all MOTO phone is the sound clarity its brilliant
 Love it use it to feel the punch...!!!
